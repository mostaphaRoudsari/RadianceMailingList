Subject: [Radiance-general] Surface normal and Rdot in mix functions
Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.0.20020503150112.00b97800@vttmail.vtt.fi>

Hi,
Is there anybody (Greg?) who could help in the following problem:

For the mixture material type one has to define a weight coefficient 
[0...1] for the 'foreground' material. Respectively, this coefficient 
subtracted from 1 is the weight for the 'background' material.

I have used .cal functions based on cos(theta) of the incoming (eye) ray. 
For this purpose, there is a special variable available, Rdot, which is the 
dot product of the eye ray and the surface normal and hence should be equal 
to cos(theta), if I have understood correctly. I have also supposed 
Radiance always flips the normal so that Rdot would get only positive 
values between 0 and 1. However, when I tested this, my functions gave 
warnings that imply negative values of Rdot. Something seems to be wrong in 
my reasoning.

Is it ok to treat positive and negative Rdot values symmetrically in mix 
functions?

I have not used surface textures, but the roughness values for trans 
material are moderately big.

Regards,
Markku

... if I recall it right:
dielectric, interface, BRTDfunc, glow and mixfunc don't re-orient
surfaces and Rdot[-1:1]
colorfunc, brightfunc, transfunc (+ their ~data equivalents), trans,
plastic(2), metal(2), glass do flip surface normals and so Rdot[0:1] .

Note that, as far as I am aware of, this "normal flipping" is
NEVER done for non-material modifiers.  The original question
was about mixtures, though the wording unintentionally confused
the issue a bit. For the materials, I think the list above is
about correct.

You can assign different materials/patterns/textures to the front
and back side of a surface simply by using "if(Rdot,1,0)" as the
coefficient for a mixture. In fact, there is a file "diffside.cal"
available in the Rayfront library that does exactly this.

If you don't want to differentiate between the two sides of a
surface in non-material modifiers, then you'll have to look at the
absolute value of Rdot (or the absolute values of Nx/Ny/Nz).
Positive and negative values of Rdot are equivalent to each other
for the respective "other" side of the surface. I'm not sure if
the perturbation caused by the roughness parameter is reflected
in the N# values seen by a function file.

So respectively "if(Rdot,Rdot, -Rdot)" returns cos(theta) if both sides are 
similar. - By the way, I never realised before that modifiers "foreground" 
and "background" could refer to the concrete front and back of a surface...

Thanks very much,

Subject: [Radiance-general] animation
Message-ID: <3CD284B0.72EB180C@iebele.nl>

Hi all,

I am rendering an animation of an interior scene. At this moment one
frame takes about half an hour to render(*), with fine results per
frame. When I view the frames as an animation however, the artifacts are
"unstable". It looks like Radiance renders shadows,
reflections(specularity) and indirect illumination in a random way.
Sometimes objects also get different color intensities in the rendered
image, as if they were lit in a (radical) other way.
I have rendered a lot of still images in Radiance and never noticed that
two renderings with exactly the same geometry, render-options, viewport
etc. results in slightly different images (!).
How can I solve this? Does anybody knows how to render without these
"moving artifacts"? Is there a random thing in Radiance that we can turn
off ?

Regards,

Iebele


(*)  Below are the settings I use for the rendering. I know that I can
increase the quality using different settings, but that is not the point
here. My point is that the overall solution has too many, and
unexpectable differences between  rendered images.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Too many questions to fit in the subject
Message-ID: <3CDA629A.13873.83396C@localhost>

Hello all.  Some of you know me, many do not.  But I have 
been experimenting with Radiance lately.  Thanks to Greg 
who tipped me off to the power of OS X (and his pre-
compiled binaries for 3.4).  I struggled with LINUX many 
times, but never got a totally functional system; I was 
rpicting all over the place after a week on OS X.  =8-)

Anyway, now that I'm getting a feel for how the various 
programs work together, I have gone back and am now 
reading the old Radiance Digests.  This has been helpful. 
Those things read like a "Who's Who in the Radiance 
Community".  And to see many of the gurus, with more 
questions than answers, makes me feel like someday I 
may get my head around all of this stuff!  Of course, many 
of those messages are eight years old.  Hmmm...

Enough rambling.  Questions:

Philip Thompson, way back in '94, inquired about the 
ability to show surface normal orientation in rview.  Was 
this ever developed?  My frame of reference is Lightscape, 
which has been excellent in this regard.  Surface normals 
can be interractively viewed, and backfaces are displayed 
in a garish green color.  Incorrectly oriented surfaces can 
be flipped with a click of a button.  It was only after my 
initial experiments that I learned surface normal 
orientation is a non-issue in Radiance (excepting windows 
via mkillum).  

Failing rview, what other geometry previewers are you 
folks using?  Ole Lemming's ConRad has a useful 
previewer, that operates similarly to the "view setup" 
dialog in Lightscape.  I really think this would speed 
things along for me, the ability to interractively orbit a 
scene & check for modeling errors, normal orientation, etc, 
and most importantly, SETTING VIEWS.  THis is a real 
hassle when you have to provide vp, vd as 3D points.  Are 
there other previewers besides ConRad?  

Greg in one of the digests said windows can be modelled 
using a single plane of glass.  (I'm used to Lightscape's 
requirement of two opposite-facing planes, lest you get 
refraction errors in a raytrace.)  Does this hold true for the 
rest of the building?  IOW, a simple room can be modelled 
with a single genbox?  I have been creating an inner 
room and an outer "shell".  Again, this may be my 
Lightscape logic getting in the way of things here.  Of 
course for detailed renderings you *have* to model the 
wall thickness, but for daylighting analysis, would a single 
box (with windows of course) suffice?  In Lightscape you 
would get "light leaks" around the corners of the interior 
as sunlight affected the vertices unless you enclosed the 
interior with an outer shell.

Re: skies.  Gensky (directed by George Mischler's radout) 
creates a description of the sky & ground luminance, and 
creates two colored hemispheres.  I have seen some 
special sky textures available for mapping to a sphere for 
more realistic environments.  How do these work?  Are 
they transparent placeholders, which merely display a 
picture of the sky but allow the sun & sky luminance to 
"pass through", or do they actually modulate the sky 
luminance as a function of the chromacity of the pixels in 
the sky image?

I have been using George Mischler's radout to bring 
geometry from AutoCAD to radiance.  But there doesn't 
seem to be a way to handle blocks.  It would be great if 
there was a way to substitute autocad blocks for 
instanced rad files!  One could export the blocks as 
separate rad files, but is there a way to take a series of 
insertion point coordinates and build a rad file that 
instances the "block" rad file at those 
coords/orientations?  That seems to be the key to being 
able to rapidly change scenes, and stay accurate.  Anyone 
doing this type of thing already?

Along those lines, is there a way to create a grid or really 
any series of points in autocad (via nodes, or blocks or 
whatever) and then have the coordinates of those points 
be fed to rtrace for lighting analysis?  I know you can feed 
rtrace the points, but I'm interested in a way to have 
autocad export the information rather than me figure out 
the points manually.  I like to draw the stuff and have 
CAD keep track of all the math, ya know?

I found a nice collection of materials online (Kevin 
Matthews, Design Workshop).  Some of the cal files are 
missing, but many of the materials are usable.  Does 
anyone else have material & light libraries they are willing 
to share?  I'm also really interested in obtaining 
definitions of translucent materials, such as one would 
find in a light fixture (sandblasted glass, acrylic, etc).  

Paul Bourke offers some great tree examples.  Again, 
does anyone have other blocks they are willing to share 
(vegetation, furniture, you name it)??  =8-)

Paul also has a benchmark page: 
http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/~pbourke/radiance |
/benchrad/

I tried the first one and my PowerBook G4 550 rendered it 
in 582 secs, which is almost exactly three times as long as 
the render time for a 1.5 GHz P4 (see the site for more 
times).  Is it just coincidence, or is there a fairly direct 
correlation between CPU speed and render time, 
regardless of processor type?  Makes Apple's ad copy 
about the "Velocity engine" in the G4 seem like a load of 
bunk (which I suspected in the first place).   Don't get me 
wrong, I love this Mac.  But it seems that when I finally 
am ready to do production work with Radiance I'm gonna 
have to learn LINUX once and for all.  The cheapest cpu 
cycles are with homebuilt PCs, so it seems that's the way 
to go.  Interestingly, there is a benchmark for a dual 2GHz 
PC, which was only 50% faster than the single 1.5 GHz.  
I'm interested in parallel processing, but this seems to 
make a case against it.  What are your experiences out 
there in the field? 

Woah.  That got long in a hurry.  I'll leave it at that for 
now.  More questions to follow hopefully.  I'd greatly 
appreciate any responses to my inquiries above.

Hi Rob,

I recommend SuSe as an Linux distribution that is relatively easy
to install and configure. Other people seem to get good results
with Mandrake. Don't even think about RedHat if you're not very
familiar with Linux already.

This may not be exactly what you wanted, but if you use the -bv-
boolean switch, then all faces will become invisible from the
back...

My personal philosophy about this point is (so far anyway), that
this is the task of the modeller you're using. Once you're
running rview (or any similar program), it's really a bit late
to do anything about flipped orientations. The fact that the
orientation doesn't matter at all for most material types in
Radiance has helped me to stick to this position.

Of course, there is the rshow program by Peter, which works on
most unix systems with OpenGL. I don't know if anyone has tried
to port it to OS X though, nor if it can do anything about
surface normals.

Radiance normally does fine with thin boxes. There *may* be light
leaks in low quality simulations when the ambient density is too
loose. But with tougher settings, you will rarely see this.

The latter is the case, as it's a simple colorpict pattern.
You will lose the accountability of the CIE sky model when you
map a picture onto the sky sphere.

Btw: Rayfront has a simple drop-down box in the sky configuration
dialog to select sky maps... ;)

In theory, this sounds easy. In practise, it would open a
pandora's box of consistency problems, not to mention the
questions about how to assign materials to subentities within
such blocks that are placed on different layers. I have been
pondering those issues for years, and haven't come up with a
practical solution yet.

I think there was some talking about doing this for Desktop
Radiance, but I have no idea if they actually got around to
implement anything of the kind. Since DR never looks back at the
Radiance data it has written, but simply overwrites it when you
change anything within Autocad, it can avoid many (but not all)
of the consistency questions.

If you're feeling adventurous and know some Autolisp, then you
could try to hack my old torad.lsp translator. If you manage to
come up with a fool proof solution, then I'll immediately
integrate it into Radout.

Both DR and Rayfront can do this for you.

If anyone wants to share their creations, I'd be more than
willing to establish and maintain an online repository.
Of course, if you use materials that others have created and
expect them to be physically meaningful (beyond just looking
nice), then you'll have to run some sanity checks on them
yourself, especially if you're thinking about procedural
definitions.

If you buy DesignWorkshop, then I think you also get a tree
generator program, which produces data that can be exported to
the Radiance scene file format.

There's something wrong either with your machine, or with the
OS X port of Radiance. There is no direct relation of processing
power and clock speed between different CPU types.  In general,
PowerPC CPUs require about half the cycles for the same results
(ie. your 550 MHz G4 is roughly aequivalent to a 1 GHz P4). If
you get only the same performance per cycle on your G4, then
you're probably running into a system bottleneck of some kind
(disk access, RAM size etc.).

Does your HD go to sleep when it isn't accessed for a few
minutes, or do you have any other power saving features turned
on? Were the Radiance binaries compiled with comparable
optimization flags? It may also be that a laptop simply has a
relatively slow HD installed to preserve energy. If you're low on
RAM, then this could stall a Radiance simulation to some degree.

No, this must have something to do with your specific system.
The G4s *are* faster than most Pentiums out there.

Linux isn't optimized for multi-CPU systems yet, although it's
getting better. It is even more difficult to directly equate
clock speed with processing power on multi-CPU system than it
already is with normal boxes. The overall architecture of the
system (both in hardware and software) can influence the result
up to a factor of 50% or more. If the amount and type of your RAM
or the configuration of your HD isn't carefully balanced against
the CPU specifications, then you'll get quite surprising results.

IMHO, the only real non-trivial problem with incorrectly oriented
surfaces happens with solid glass (=dielectric) objects. If the CAD
spills out polygons with quasi-random orientation (AutoCAD 12 caused me
some temporary headaches years back), hand tweaking the orientations is
not an option. Problems with orientation of glow and spotlight surfaces
are typically easier to hand-tweak. All other surfaces, as you know,
don't care for orientation.

http://www.pab-opto.de/progs/rshow/rshow.html - shows surface
orientation too (when moving the mouse over surfaces and keeping the
middle (OS-X ??) button down.) come to think of it,- there's no OS-X
version available yet.

I guess one problem with libraries is the naming. When 4 people find
"Sandblasted" in the list, they have 25 different ideas how that looks
in reality. "Lightly sandblasted" doesn't help either.

No way. CPU architectures (super-scalar, pipelining, cache coherence)
plus compiler optimizations de-correlate clock speed from rendering
times.

I've got no experience with 2Ghz (AMD ?) dual boards, although all other
duals (PII 200MHz- PIII 1Ghz) worked as expected so far. Mem speed, disk
times (if needed, typically not so much for Radiance during rendering,
rpict does heavy I/O only at startup while reading the scene) and cache
size may slow down overall throughput.
btw: With rpict, -PP allows sharing the geometry between two rpict
programs on the same machine. Useful for large scenes.

stochastic calculations are used as MC integration in specular and
ambient calculations and for efficency reasons in direct and secondary
light sources. Your vastly different images sound like a too optimistic
approximation in the direct calcs (dt, dc options- how many light
sources are there ?), but most animation suffer from varying ambient
calculations. If it's only a walk-through animation with a fixed scene,
it helps to pre-run along the path doing every n-th frame (n=2..10) with
a small resolution and fill an ambient file. 

Very probably rendering times will go up for artifacts to go down - You
may want to try the pinterp program to interpolate between frames,
although it uses more diskspace and the controlling script/program gets
more complex (especially using multiple machines to render on).
Interpolation breaks with reflecting/refracting surfaces too, but
otherwise speeds up animation quite a bit.

Hi Georg, how ya doin'?  Did you get a chance to see that 
movie "Pi" I was telling you about?  

Yes, I heeded your advice about SuSE a number of years 
ago, and that was indeed the closest I got to really doing 
something with Radiance on the PC.  That was the first 
distro that I got installed and was able to compile 
Radiance.  There were some utilities not working correctly 
though, and I never got a chance to troubleshoot them, 
because about a week after my first radiance compile 
success, a fire broke out in my apartment building.  The 
good news was the fire did not destroy my apartment; 
the bad news was, mine was was on the top floor and 
the fire department cut a cole in my ceiling to vent the 
smoke.  They cut a 4'x4' hole in the ceiling.  Guess what 
was under it -- my computer!!  Grrr.  Yes, I had countless 
problems with Red Hat, and no, I'm not familiar with it.  I 
expect that soon I will need to go out & buy the latest 
SuSE and try installing it on my PC at home.  The Mac has 
been a good jump-starter for me though.

Interesting.  Well, since you have confirmed that normals 
don't matter (except for mkillum), I guess I shouldn't 
worry about it.  I can use that switch to confirm that 
mkillum polygons are correct though.  Thanks.

I agree with you.  It is a bit late in the game to fix it at the 
rview stage.  You wouldn't happen to know the name of 
the lisp utility that comes with DR, that shows normals?  I 
suppose I could use that too...

Yes, I have heard of rshow and it looks good.  But as 
soon as I saw that it was OGL, I assumed I'd need Mesa, 
and compiling, and well you know my experience is not 
quite up to that yet.  Maybe that's a good challenge for 
me though, since Greg already took care of compiling Rad 
for us OS X users.

OK, so validity goes out the window when you map the 
pretty pictures.  For serious daylighting analysys I should 
stick to the gensky primitives.  

Yeah, maybe I need to have a look at your demo.  Since I 
don't have a Linux system running (yet), what will I be 
missing by using the NT version?  See, the whole reason 
I'm trying to learn Radiance from the Unix side is because 
I'm amazed by all the scripting possibilities (the time of 
day image sequence in "Rendering With Radiance" for 
example) it affords.  Just wondering if there are things 
that just aren't possible on the NT side.

Hmmm.  I was thinking of only using it for importing 
luminaire layouts and lighting analysis points.  In fact, I do 
this all the time in Lightscape, using their block 
substitution routine.   How do you get your luminaires 
from AutoCAD into Radiance scene descriptions?

I know very little AutoLISP.  But maybe I'll have a look.

I figured, I was just wondering if there was a way to

Yes, I saw on their website that there is a tree generator -
- you sort-of build your own tree by selecting from a menu 
of choices, and then you download a DW file, which can 
then be exported to Radiance format from DW.  I had DW 
at my old office but found it very buggy, crash-prone.

Hmmm.  I ran it while on battery, and figured the CPU was 
ramping down to conserve juice and that that was the 
cause, but I plugged it in and re ran it, and the first three 
checkpoints were all identical (i.e. same percentage 
complete).  It's a small scene and the laptop has 512MB 
of RAM, so I didn't think it could be paging/disk access.  
I'm still not up on all the tweaks one can do in unix to give 
jobs priority; perhaps that's the problem.  Dunno.  That's 
why I didn't bother to send the timing to Paul Bourke, 
because I suspect it's inaccurate (or unfair).

Hey Rob:

One way to check normal orientation by hand with Radiance is to assign a
temporary material using a glow material to the geometry in questions.
The "front" side will be the color of the glow while the "back" side
will be black. Rather than looking at all the geometry in question you
can use objview to look at the specific geometry of interest.

Hi lebele,

I concur with Georg that you should use the -af option of rpict to save 
your ambient values, both to accelerate your rendering and to reduce 
differences between adjacent frames.  The -ps 8 option you specify is 
also going to aggravate sampling errors in your image.  I also think you 
should use a larger value for -lr -- 1 is awfully limiting.

If you want to minimize sampling differences, you can explicitly turn 
off some of the randomness in Radiance with:
	-dj 0 -sj 0
You will lose penumbras and soft specular reflections in the process, 
unfortunately.

I agree with Peter that pinterp will speed things up considerably, along 
with the -af option. (INTERPOLATE=4 is a good starting value).

Check out the "glrad" program that comes with Radiance 3.4.  It works on 
my version of X11 for OS X, which is the same as yours, as you told me 
how to install it!  Also, take a look at the rholo program and see if 
you can figure out how to work it.  This gives you a more flexible way 
to move around your scene than rview.

I'm way out of my depth, here, but have you looked at the replmarks 
program that comes with Radiance?  I would think Georg would have 
mentioned it in his reply unless he had a reason not to, so maybe it's 
irrelevant.  Anyway, replmarks replaces triangular placeholders with 
Radiance instances or objects, and it shouldn't be too difficult to 
adapt this to work with AutoCAD blocks, though I admit that I'm not sure 
what these are.

Thanks to all who replied to my numerous questions, both 
on- and off-list.  I appreciate it.  I'd like to follow up with 
some of you separately, time permitting.  

Replmarks look interesting, I will look at the manpage in 
more detail.  I can see how that truly could be a disaster 
in terms of version tracking, etc, but it's worth a shot.  

I must be a glutton for punishment, because now I'm off 
on a new tangent -- thinking of installing Linux on the 
PowerBook. (!) I found out about a product called 
YellowDog Linux, which purports to be a no-brainer install 
(triple boot scheme with Mac OS9, OSX and Linux) on the 
PowerBooks.  My thought was that if I'm gonna have to 
ultimately learn to manage Radiance installations on Linux 
to have a render farm, why not start sooner than later?  
The down side is that YellowDog is based on... Red Hat.  
Now I know that some of the Radiance community is 
having success with Red Hat (Hi Jack!); could you explain 
what the caveats are regarding trying to compile 
Radiance on Red Hat?  It's just a thought right now, I'm 
not really excited about backing up my young system and 
repartitioning the whole deal, but supposedly this 
YellowDog Linux really flies, and then I could try out 
Peter's rshow, and...

Time to check on the status of my application for the 36 
hour day!

MESA is one Open-GL implementation running on top of X11 with no
hardware acceleration.
If a system is configured with other Open-GL libraries, typically using
direct hardware rendering in conjuntion with kernel and X11 server,
rshow, as other Open-GL programs, will use that, since it uses the
shared libraries installed on the system. It is known to run on
I386-architecture SUSE7.3 on a machine which had been configured to use
HW accel.

Hi all,

I also spent some time on tests on the export of blocks from AutoCAD to
instances in Radiance.
At least it's working in a more or less rough manner (even with nested
blocks).
Beside the consistency problems Georg already mentioned, problems arose
concerning the paths
(to texture files or IES-data) and the shape of the octree hierarchy.
Especially thin long Objects, like railings, or flat Objects, like
leafs, produce the biggest problems.
I had to reorganize the blocks to get the expected savings in memory and
file sizes (which could be enormous, of course).
In other words - I must create the geometry in terms Radiance likes it
most - which isn't always the most efficient way to build 3D-Modells.
As I understood, the octree is based on cubes. Looking at a leaf
parallel to the xy-plane inside a cube, there is a lot of 'emptiness'
inside this cube. The cubes of other nearby leaves are interconnected
which often result in an error by oconv. 
As a result I have to reorganize the blocks or increase the n-parameter
dramatically.
For these problems it could help a lot, if the 'cage' around objects
could be handled in a more relaxed way, i.e. in terms of a real bounding
box.
Are there any thoughts done already in that direction? Could it be a
feature for the future?
Or is it impossible due to the existing octree organization?
Any comments are welcome.

Kurt

It is terribly inefficient to create instances with only a few 
primitives in them.
An octree should have a few hundred geometric primitives to make it
worthwhile in terms of rendering time.  Given such a constraint, it is 
usually
possible to partition geometry so it is roughly cubical in terms of 
volume,
though I agree this is an inconvenience.  The only reason it was done 
this
way is to stick with a strict octree as opposed to a binary partition 
tree,
which is more complicated to code and takes up more space in memory.
One could have an octree with a non-cubical bounding box, but the
efficiency of tracing rays through long, thin subcubes would be awful.

I don't recommend putting individual leaves into instances -- when I have
used instances for trees, I put groups of leaves or needles together into
an instance.  It may be better to put in the entire tree in many cases.
Railings and walls should never go into instances.

As I suggested to Rob, the replmarks program offers the ability to 
generate
xform calls to place raw geometry into the scene, and this is far 
preferable
for long or thin geometry such as you describe.  Instancing should be
reserved for cases where duplicating geometry causes memory problems
during rendering, such as when you are modeling a forest of trees or
a great number of similarly complicated geometric objects.  For simple,
replicated geometry, you will get faster renderings and less hassle if
you just duplicate it throughout your scene, even if it means having
hundreds of identical objects floating around.

Here's a good rule of thumb for when instances might be appropriate:

N_p > 200, and
N_o * N_p > N_t / 5

where:
	N_p = number of geometric primitives in instanced object
	N_o = number of instances
	N_t = total scene size (excluding other instances)

Otherwise, it is better to use xform and just duplicate geometry.

Geometry exported from CAD is often complex and uses Radiance primitives
not very efficiently, e.g. everything is tesselated into polygons, even
if the surface could be described as sphere, cone etc. Mostly
hierarchical structures are left intact, e.g. a line of complex carved
posts is known to the exporting routine as "instances" of the same
element.
Then, IMHO, there's no generaly sound way to reorganize geometry to fill
RADIANCE instances with cube like geometry.

If I get this right, the penalty for non-cubical bounding boxes with
non-thin geometry distribution would be nil, with the advantage that it
would allow placing "thinny" instances next to another without
overlapping bounding cubes. 
Code for checking ray intersections with non-cubical boxes would be as
efficient as checking cubical boxes ? If not, would that be
counterweight by the speedup as rays close to the bounding box miss the
non-cubical box completely whereas they hit (and trigger at least one
octree lookup) a cubical now ?

As always, any insights very much welcome

Thanks Greg and Peter for your replies,

I tried your suggestions, while some already were taken into account. The
results are better, but not that good that my problem is solved (put it in
other words: it does not fit my application yet). Also rendering times are
very long now.
That is why I like to ask you something that is in my mind for over a year.

The general purpose I use Radiance for is presentation and design of
architecture and public exterior lighting. There is no other rendering tool
that offers me the flexibility and kind of images that Radiance produces. What
I also need from Radiance is the photometric correctness of the images, but I
always use the images in a sequence, comparing one image with the other, to
disccuss design issues. That means that the numerical representation of
lighting is less important for me as the 'look'. This allows me to work on
images with image processing tools, this actually destroys some of the
Radiance data, but makes the design better to communicate (for my purposes).

Back to the animation-issue. It takes too much time to render animations for
our application, because we use very large geometry, we use a lot of light
sources,  we have to render several minutes, we only (?) have 4 cpu's
available on Linux and we have to produce very good looking images for our
customers (they expect images like they have seen on tv/dvd : sharp sharper
sharpest).
To survive the competition using Radiance (we are using Radiance daily, so we
really don't want to work with something else) we need another approach, and
we are willing to spent our time to get it work.

Taken the above into account, I and my partner are thinking about an image
format like the radiance .pic, that is rendered without ambient bounces (-ab
0). In this (or additional) image format we also like to have the following
data per pixel (ok, these images take lots of diskspace...):


   * name of the modifier for the object this pixel represent (as a string)
   * normal orientation of this object (float float float)
   * position of the pixel in XYZ space (float float float)

With this information per pixel (maybe I need more info in te future) we think
we can produce an automated proces in enhancing radiance pictures that are
rendered without radiosity. This process is 2D image processing, using some 3d
data that is 'stored' with the pixel.
Also this kind of image data allows us to separate objects in one image, to
process them individually in 2D.

We think we can speed up animation times using a combination of 3d and 2d (
rendering my scene with -ab 0 takes about 9 minutes on 4 times PAL res.
against 3 hours with a nice radiosity as you suggested.
Probably far more to achieve the results we really want. 2d/3d image
processing will take about 5 minutes or less per frame ).

I already looked at rtrace, which seems to produce the kind of information I
need. Two problems arose when I looked at rtrace:

1. I don't know where to start
2. I think I prefer changing code in rpict (to use the -S option and -vf
option )
3. I think I prefer changing code in rpict.c (to have a all in one executable,
instead of using scripts)

As you understand, some hints are very much appreciated.
I think about these kind of hints:
-where in rpict.c are pixels stored into a file (or stdout)?
-Is it possible at that point to write the mentioned data to stdout also?
-What are the variables/pointers that hold these data?

The 2D processing of the resulting files will be my work (although I don't
know what kind of project I start here) and I like to share the results with
the 'community', when it finally works as we want.

I hope my questions are not to difficult or time consuming to answer. I would
be really _happy_  to experiment with this. I think it will result in a really
nice tool for video production environments (again, we will work on these
tools, I only need a good starting point for them).

Ok, this starts to get a long email, I hope you believe with me that the above
is worth trying, although it might have a very expiremental character in the
beginning.

Then use "xform" rather than instances.

I shouldn't have said "subcubes" when I meant "sub-boxes."  Ray
intersection tests in long, thin sub-boxes would be inefficient, and
the only way to make it efficient again is using a kd-tree, which
is more complicated to code.  I originally implemented cubical
octrees because they were simpler and just as fast as kd-trees
according to other people's research on the subject, and when
I added instances later, I was too lazy to reimplement everything
just so I could have non-cubical bounding boxes for instances.
I barely got it to work properly as it was -- you wouldn't believe
how much stuff is going on "behind the scenes" to make instancing
work right.  (Well, maybe you would.)

I wouldn't trust the octree code with long, thin boxes.  It's too likely
to run into floating point inaccuracies in extreme cases.  A lot of
the design of Radiance is based on my intuition of what will work
and what won't, and you're welcome to try things out
and prove me wrong.  I really don't mind, or take it personally.

Hi Iebele !

I dare to mix in the discussion, as the general topic is of some
interest for me, too. I myself thought/still think (and did experiment
as well) about "tricks" of what kind ever to produce good looking images 
in less time as currently needed. (Despite the benefits of physical
accuracy, the look of an image is very important for me, too).

By the way, if you use lots of light sources, you may check out that
direct cache stuff, (now the missing patch is included in the
distribution as well, so installation should work, too, sorry for
forgetting it at the first time). As long as you need some ambient
calculation, time saving is quite significant, maybe not as much as you
want, but making things 4 times faster is better than nothing.

Now back to your ideas: I thought of 2D postprocessing, too, for example
some sort of "shadow-softener" for images traced without ambient light,
with help of your idea of 3D-data integration maybe this might become a
realistic thing. There are some ways of tricking in 3D as well. POVRay
for example allows to assign ambient illumination to different objects
directly, it is no problem to integrate this into RADIANCE, too. If
you're interested, I may dig out the stuff and send it to you. (Don't
tell Greg of all this ... :-) ). Another way is to simulate ambient
light effects by some weak additional and invisible direct sources
suitably placed, as often it suffices to lighten the dark shadows which
appear in standard raytracing to mimick a realistic look. This method
has the further advantage that it is accessible to "feeling" rather than
the dry topic of parameters.

Last but not least, some of the hints you've asked for:

getting the mentioned data out of the machine certainly is the easiest
part of the way your're setting out to tread: 

Color output is done in the 'render()' routine within rpict.c, with help
of the 'pixvalue()' (rpict.c) routine giving that color, the rest is not
of interest for this case. Rather than writing data to stdout, it would
be easier to write them directly to a file, as rpict uses stdout for
messages. The data you want to extract are contained in the ray
structure (check ray.h), with exception of the object name (a number is
used instead so a separate mapping to the name will be needed), so
extracting them should be fairly straightforward. 
 
Maybe this suffices as starting point ... off you go, and good luck of
course. And please tell me, if it works.

I don't know about your country, but in the U.S., computers are a whole 
lot cheaper
than people, and it might be worthwhile to invest in a stack of Linux 
boxes to run
your animations -- Charles Ehrlich while he was still at LBNL put a 
tower together
last year with 9 CPUs and a disk array for less than $15K US.

This reminds me a lot of Ken Perlin's classic 1985 Siggraph paper, where
he uses his noise function with similar pixel information to sythesize 
images.

I strongly suggest you use rtrace, as it is already designed and 
optimized
for this type of output.  When you use the -fff and -omNp options, you 
will
avoid all recursive ray calls and get a very fast calculation.  The rays
for any desired view can be generated with the vwrays command (new
with 3.4).  To generate the 10th view in the file "anim.vf", you could 
use:

% sed -n 10p anim.vf > frame10.vf
% vwrays -ff -vf frame10.vf -pa 0 -x 3072 -y 2304 \
	| rtrace -x 3072 -y 2304 -fff -omNp anim.oct > frame10.data

See the vwrays man page for more details and examples.

With this information per pixel (maybe I need more info in te future) we
think
we can produce an automated proces in enhancing radiance pictures that
are
rendered without radiosity. This process is 2D image processing, using
some 3d
data that is 'stored' with the pixel.
Also this kind of image data allows us to separate objects in one image,
to
process them individually in 2D.
...

Will it work generally ? With specular/reflecting surfaces and shadows ?
Will 2d processing be validated to have the same trust as Radiance now
has ? Maybe you're on the way towards Wavefront, Renderman or whetever
there is for professional animations, without actually getting their
speed or quality, but loosing a lot of Radiance.
IMHO, speedups for animations in Radiance will be a side effect when/if
the core rendering is enhanced (photon map, direct caching maybe) and
validated. Meanwhile, Greg's recommendation of using brute force and
some more CPUs sounds right to me.

Or you may try to render texture maps through Radiance, which are then
glued onto surfaces and final frame rendering is done by other rendering
engines (which may have more inter-frame coherence too). At least the
interface would be well defined. Your mileage may very.

Hi all !

I think two aspects have to be separately kept in mind concerning the
whole matter, to avoid useless work or disappointment.

The Radiance ambient treatment is somewhat awkward to handle, and I've
noticed that people without a sound scientific background have
difficulties with the overwhelming features and parameters and all the
thinking behind it, which is a pity as it appears rather often that
designers or architects are not computer specialists or scientists as
well (which shouldn't be misinterpreted now, I do not mean this as
offence, simply an observation).

On the other hand, Radiance, esp. the ambient calculation, simply is a
fantastic thing which allows to create images with superior quality
which outscore everything else. And I readily agree with the opinion
that 2D postprocessing or some other tricks and workarounds never can
replace this adequately and a more promising way is to optimize the
method within itself. Besides, lighting visualisation is a complex
matter, and it is common sense that there is no easy way for
accomplishing difficult tasks.

Of course, Radiance is aimed very much at realistic image generation,
and it would be nice to have more "artistic freedom" in using it. This
is a totally different matter. Within the first stages of a creative
progress scientific exactness does not count that much, and so all kinds
of tricks are welcome as long as they help to produce an impression,
something which can convey ideas. One may compare this to the deliberate
abstraction and individual styles employed in "old-fashioned" techniques
like oil-painting for example. And opening Radiance for these kinds of -
maybe "freaky" - applications certainly is interesting, as then all
stages of a design process could be covered in a better way as it is
possible right now. Of course it then is important to keep track of 
what is art, what is trick, what is scientifically exact, etc, so in the
end everything will be even more complex. But complexity makes life
interesting, who wants to be bored ?

As I wrote in my previous message : "I would be really _happy_  to
experiment with this". Now I am _HAPPY_!

Thanks Greg and Carsten for your replies.
This morning the first thing I did was trying Greg's command line suggestions,
I changed the output to ASCII to explore the results, and: this is exactly
what I meant!
I will work on this as much as time permits me to do, and I will share the
results. This might take a while, therefore I will thank you both at this
moment very, very much.
Carsten, also your suggestions where to look in rpict (ray.h) are very
helpfull. For this moment I will start with Greg's suggestion. The syntax of
the command line is far less complicated as I expected, so this will work for
now.
I changed Greg's line a little, so the output per pixel now is:
modifier-name value normal position
( vwrays -ff -vf view01.vf -pa 0 -x 1000 -y 1000  | rtrace -x 1000 -y 1000
-fff -omvNp model.oct > test.data ).

This is where I can start from, I let you know when I have some results (or
questions), but for now there is a lot to experiment with.

Thanks a lot!

Hi Peter,

Your reply includes some critical remarks on the subject.
I will try to answer them from my point of view, within the context of
animation (please remember that  my project would have taken about 2250
hours (14 weeks) on 4 1000Mhz cpus when rendered as animation, and still
having significant artifacts).

> Will it work generally ? With specular/reflecting surfaces and shadows ?

Transparent surfaces (like glass) seem yet another problem for me....

What I will try is using a radiance picture without radiosity and then
change the value of each pixel a little depending on the normal orientation
of that pixel. When the normal points upward, I make the pixel just a liitle
brighter, facing downwards, the pixel becomes a liitle darker, etc.
This is needed for my application, since a non-radiosity interior image
looks very flat (a cube in such a case is hardly recognisable as a cube).

My approach is a little like "vloeken in de kerk" (dutch: using bad language
in the church):  I am aware of that.  Believe me: I hardly dared to bring
the topic into this discussion (...).
We want to use animation in combination with "real" radiance images in the
editing of a project (so we don't use bad words all the time :).
The animation is meant to provide a way of having some insight in the
spatial behaviour of a building.
When we use another renderers besides radiance however, these images don't
look very good (they are _different_ ). To mention: luminaires, sky
defention, the appearance of 'white' surfaces etc, the overall feeling of
light (even if ab=0 I feel light in the scene -  I never felt light in
Lightscape, but ok, that was about 8 years ago).

> Will 2d processing be validated to have the same trust as Radiance now
> has ?

When I program this 2d processing: certainly not!
That will be far beyond my skills.
I give it a try, when it does what I imagine I am satisfied.
If anybody can do it better: please!!!

I don't want to use different rendering tools within one project. As I said:
we will use radiance anyway.
Other renderers require other ways of getting the data right. This means:
much extra work within the same deadlines.
There is something else. I worked with a lot of renderers (except renderman)
and what I like about radiance is that we are able to write scripts for
complex situations. For example we did a project in which there were 4
variations on 4 building types on 2 different location-types.
We rendered two views from every possible combination and put these images
in a simple user-interface. The scripting took 2 hours, the renderings
overnight. Is there any renderer that allows me to do this? I really rely on
Radaince in such cases.

To me also. Maybe I am wrong and the whole idea will not work.
I will be happy to show you some images after I finished  my homework :)
I am very curious what the result are. My opinion is very humble in this....

Yet there is another application where I am thinking about: when I know
which object/modifier is represented by a pixel, I easily can put each
object-pixel in a different layer ( as in photoshop) and enhance them
seperately.
This is very usefull in video, for example to dim oversaturated colors a
bit.

Why not Radiance in this case?

> (which may have more inter-frame coherence too). At least the
> interface would be well defined.

Last but not least: Is there a way to do this ? I read some discussions
about this topic, and it seems to me that it does not really work (?). Or am
I wrong here?

Just to mention within this context. Something simular to the above: we work
on 360o panoramic views (2048x2048pixels, rendering times about 10 hours for
one oversampled image, but that doesn't hurt for a single image), which we
map on a slowly rotating cylinder in OpenGL, and then we render these frames
to file. These result are quite good (and fast and reliable/trustable). The
only bad thing is that I am not an educated programmer, and the application
crashes as soon as I write an image to a file... So I've seen the results
only in the application, not on video yet.
Time will fix this sooner or later.


> Your mileage may very.

I can't translate this sentence, mileage is not in my dictionary (?)

It's true. All the options are awful. However, not a single solution,
both efficient and general, is known that solves the underlying,
fundamental light "rendering equation", without hand tweaking the
algorithms by specifying parameters. That's where technology stands now. 
Tweaking simulation to do non-realistic images doesn't really help any
designer in finding a solution that is actually realistic.

I'm not quite certain that'll become a main-stream direction of Radiance
development, as the physical quality is the prime motivation to use it.

My experiences with rayshade where excellent- Much easier, many more
features (motion blur built in, more powerful input format, easier
texture mapping). POVray is probably even more powerful and easier to
customize. Both are in the public domain. There are many converters, or
converters could be build to go from one rendering systems to the other.
There's nothing wrong in using another package. There's nothing wrong in
playing with scenes and "artistic freedom" lighting in spaces. There
just aren't convincing reasons why Radiance should leave the path of
strict physical correct simulation.

Isn't that what they call "non-photorealism" nowadays? :^)
Do we really want to *downgrade* RADIANCE with this?

Hi all !

I think the discussion starts to leave the range this forum was set up
for, but as I don't want to be looked at as the heretic, I simply have
to state something for self defence :) .
I really didn't mean Radiance to go for a Disney-style colorful pictures
renderer, there are lots of them already available. But on the other
hand, disregarding physical accuracy here and there is no black magic
either. In fact, it is already offered by Radiance, e.g with the "glow"
primitive and its maximum radius for shadow testing, which helps very
much in certain cases. Almost each task shows small details where the
means to create an effect within a picture / a simulation are not 1:1
copies from the ones applied in the real installation within a building,
and this doesn't have to mean a loss of realistic thinking, it simply is
a question of efficiency. And having more freedom to do so would be no
"downgrading" either. 
It might of course be confusing if too many different approaches to an
issue appear within the same tool. In this respect I understand the hint
of relegating "artistic" tasks to other programs. But this often is
horribly inefficient, more time is spent with converting or setting up a
scene a second time in another format, so that I personnally prefer to
do as much as possible with one tool (cf. Iebeles comment..).

And then there is of course the aesthetical dimension. For the reception
of a picture, the question of accuracy is not the only criterium. And
the demands of the public are paradox. One one hand, they want sound,
efficient and realisable solutions, but the same time they want to be
"entertained", want to see something fantastic, impressive. Maybe trying
to bring this together makes the main proportion of the art of
simulation. It is a difficult task, so why restrain oneself by locking
away some sections of the toolbox?

In the end, all is of course a question of individual preferences, so
now I will be quiet. Really. :)

I think I will be quiet  for a short while too. We now work on the subject
and I really hope we get some useable results, within reasonable time. I am
very pleased with the hints and helps, and the implicit discussion is of
great value too(!), although it indeed might 'leave the range this forum was

See you later!

Hi all,

I appologize for the slightly off-topic request, even though
it actually *is* related to Radiance.

I am urgently looking for the possibility to compile some
software on an sgi machine under IRIX. Space and performance
requirements are minimal, and the whole operation should be
over within less than an hour per ssh. A functioning C
complier is mandatory (gcc is fine), a working installation
of Python 1.5.2 would be helpful, but isn't critical.
I could also live with a commercial service, as long as I
can afford the price...

If anyone knows of an installation where this would be possible,
or has one available, please e-mail me directly, so we don't
pollute this list any further.


Thanks for any pointers!

Me again.  I have a couple of test scenes I'm

to automate the extraction of illuminance levels to a file.

Could you decipher this a little bit?  I don't see where you 
feed it the 4x5 grid.  Also, looking at the manpage, it 
looks like rtrace with the -I switch takes the input origin & 
direction and interprets it as "measurement point and 
orientation".

I tried something like:
rtrace -h -I 60 60 30 0 0 1 scene.oct 

I thought this would give me the irradiance at a point 60" 
over(+x), 60" up (+y), and 30" off the floor (+z), whth the 
"light meter" facing up along the z axis.  But this gave me 
an error at the command line.  WHat is the proper syntax? 
 I was hoping to fill a text file with measurement points 
and feed it to rtrace, and use something like your script 
above to produce a table of measurement points and 
corresponding illuminance values...

the position and orientation vectors are grabbed from standard input.
For example, grabbing them from a file would require:

rtrace -h -I scene.oct < scene.pos

For your single measurement you'd use:

echo 60 60 30 0 0 1 | rtrace -h -I scene.oct

Ain't UNIX fun? :^)

Hi Rob,

Do you have rillum?  if you have rillum, it makes this process somewhat easier.

1. create an input file with a pile of measuring points and positions, 
similar to your 60 60 30 0 0 1.  cnt and rcalc can help in the creation of 
this file, but it can also be done in any text editor, or spreadsheet and 
exported as an ascii file.  use one line per measuring point.
2. rillum [rtrace options] octree < infile > outfile

the output file then contains a column of illuminances corresponding to the 
measuring points and orientations defined in the input file.  if you wish, 
you can then use lam to put the input and output files together in a table.

good luck!
Phil Greenup.

It's getting more fun all the time, as I move out of the 
"complete idiot" category and into the "pathetic novice" 
category, unix-wise.  Greg's tip about OSX and his pre-
compiled binaries have really helped me get up & running 
on a unix-based Radiance learning trip, and this list is 
now helping too.  I appreciate it.

Well, that sounds like a useful little program.  I don't have 
this.  Where do I get it??  I am using pre-compiled 
binaries for OS X, created by Greg Ward.  Most of the 
other stuff is there, but not glrad or this rillum.  

I'd compile the source myself, but I get errors all the time, 
both on OSX and Linux. (Yes, I installed Yellow Dog Linux 
2.2 on my Powerbook.  I couldn't help myself.)  And at the 
moment I'm far more interested in using Radiance than 
administering a unix system, so I guess I'm cheating a bit 
by using precompiled binaries.  =8-)

Thanks Greg.  Since I don't have rillum (yet) this works 
well.  I typed this up in a text file, and did a chmod 755 on 
it, so I can call that whole mess with one filename.  
(Roland- fun with unix! ;-)) However, my problem now is 
that it recorded values of zero!  The scene is not dark.  I 
double checked the inputs.  It's still zero.  My room is 
12'x14', but I'm working in inch units, so my code went 
like this:

cnt 15 30 | rcalc -e 
$1=(144-6)/(15-1)*$1;$2=(168-6)/(30-1);$3=30' \
-e '$4=0;$5=0;$6=1' | rtrace -I -h [options] octree \
  | rcalc -e '$1=179*(.265*$1+.670*$2+.065*$3)' > 
output.dat

(note: the first two lines above are on one line in the 
command file.  Damn emailer.)

This should place a grid of "light meters" facing up, 2'6" 
off the floor, right?  Why is my scene illuminance reading 
zero??  It's a daylit space!  When I load a pic into ximage 
and pick a point & press return, I get radiance values of 
.298, .428, on the floor.  Hmmm...

Also, I'm wondering how rtrace gets its information, since 
it's working with an octree, not a pic file.  I don't 
understand how it can compute irradiance so fast unless 
it somehow works with a pic file and/or the cached 
ambient file.  Along those lines, if you want accurate 
values for a room, and only have generated a pic of, say, 
the north elevation, how accurate are the vertical 
illuminance values on the south elevation?

Some more info:

I just did a falsecolor image of my scene and it too shows 
a totally dark room, with a single patch of direct sun.  THe 
rest of the space is < 1Lux.  So, that explains why the 
cnt/rcalc/rtrace/rcalc program is returning these zero 
values, but I don't understand why the lighting analysis 
and the pic files don't seem to agree on things at all.  It's 
a simple room with a north-facing clerestory and an 
opening punched out of the south wall.  There is a scene 
description with a gensky command and the two 
hemispheres for sky/ground glow.  Several renderings of 
the space show that it is indeed illuminated, and running 
it through pcond -h creates a nice looking image.  I've 
been using the rad program for now, so I think the 
parameters are in order, I have ambient=4 detail=high 
quality=medium.  

So, my photons are leaving the scene between the time I 
create the pic files and the time I run the ligting analysis.  
Did I create my model over a black hole?  Hmmm...

That's what you get for using those weird nonstandad units... ;)
I suspect that your points are located inside some wall,
since they all have the same y-value of 5.5862069.

You migh want to check the output of the first two stages
of the pipe sequence for a sanity check:

 cnt 15 30 | rcalc -e '$1=(144-6)/(15-1)*$1;$2=(168-6)/(30-1);$3=30' \
  -e '$4=0;$5=0;$6=1'

(You also had a quote character missing at the start of the first
expression, but that's probably a copying error in the e-mail)

Which I suppose is one way of saying RTFM.  Sorry gang.  
Now I see that rtrace needs to be told what to do just 
like rpict, in terms of the myriad switches.  Sigh.  I guess 
coming from the Lightscape/radiosity world I still can't 
shake the idea that once you wait a while for a calc, all 
the data is there for the asking.  

Is there a way to somehow tell rad to do some rtrace 
stuff and have rad control the options based on a .rif file, 
in the manner that rad controls rpict?

I really hate this damned machine,

It never does quite what I want,
But only what I tell it.


Ok, I admit that the default parameters of the various Radiance
programs are not designed to give you a first "nice looking"
result without any tweaking. Which is probably a healthy fact
to get bumped against right before the first illusions of
perfection can kick in... ;)

You can run a "rad -n" on the rif, and copy the relevant parts of
the output to a file. Then use the @<file> parameter with rtrace.
In fact, it often is a good idea to run a small picture before the
rtrace, to more thoroughly initialize the ambient file. The few
dozen initial rays from your grid may not cause the altorithm to
look at all corners of your space in sufficient density, which can
result in somewhat erratic or even lopsided output values.

Hi Rob,

rillum is available with Adeline, Desktop Radiance and Rayfront.  Perhaps 
it's not a unix thing.

as Georg has said, all your y values are the same possibly placing your 
measuring point in the wall somewhere.  try adding a '*$2' into your y 
definition, as below.

Interesting, I wasn't even aware of that...

Rillum came with the Radiance for Windows sources, so I just
included it without having another look. I am not licensed to
distribute the source, but on a unix system, a shell script
doing the same thing would look like this:


#!/bin/sh
rtrace -I+ -dv- -h- -x 1 $* | rcalc -e '$1=47.1*$1+117.2*$2+14.7*$3'


You call this with all the rtrace parameters you like, followed
by the octree, and it will read the points and vectors from
stdin, spitting out illuminance values at the other end.
Basically rillum is part of what we have already seen written out
few times now, just implemented in C because there's no decent
shell on Windows...  ;)

Hi Guys,

I am continually impressed by the quality of support this group offers!  
They even caught the little mistake I included  in my example, which Rob 
so dutifully copied, where I forgot the second index variable:

The only thing we all missed is that the rillum script does exist in the 
Unix distribution -- it's just called "rlux".  It wasn't until schorsch 
pointed out the contents that I recognized it.  I thought rillum might 
do something more than this.  Anyway, there is also a program called 
"dayfact" which can generate false color images of the workplane 
illuminance (as well as daylight factor contours), and that might be 
useful in this situation.  It's also interactive, which means a little 
less command-line coding for the "pathetic novice."

Regarding calculation options, you can use rad directly to do what 
schorsch was suggesting with cut and paste:

% rad scene.rif OPTFILE=render.opt
% ... | rtrace @render.opt [other options] octree | ...

If you like, you can put the OPTFILE definition right in your scene.rif 
file, then you'll always have this file handy when you need it.  Rad is 
careful only to put options that are understood by all the renderers 
into this file, rtrace, rpict, and rview.

Beware! In fact rlux is not exactly similar to rillum since it calls rtrace
with option -i+ instead of -I

rlux is supposed to be used in conjunction with ximage to compute
irradiance at locations in the scene selected from an already exsiting
picture like this:

ximage picture.pic | rlux (rtrace options) octreefile
where octreefile is the same that served for producing the picture

>From ximage use command "t" to send the x,y,z,xdir,ydir,zdir values to rlux
that will then compute the illuminance reaching the first encountred
surface in this direction.

Thanks to Raphael for pointing out that rlux is different from rillum -- 
I was mistaken in thinking them the same.  I really need to think more 
carefully before I type, and especially before I press "send!"  I 
realized after I'd sent that message that I had made another mistake, as 
the following is the correct way to execute rad to create an options 
file without running any renderings:

% rad -n -s scene.rif OPTFILE=render.opt

Without the -n option (as I had put in the last message), rad will run 
whatever renderings are indicated in the scene.rif file, which was not 
the point.  The -s option simply prevents it from echoing the commands 
it _would_ have executed, which you probably don't want to see...

There are a number of other fun ways to execute rad.  The following 
command will fill in ambient values for all the views in the scene.rif 
file at once (provided the AMBFILE variable is set):

% rad -v 0 scene.rif OPTFILE=render.opt
% rad -n -s -V scene.rif | rpict @render.opt -S 1 -x 64 -y 64 
scene.oct > /dev/null

The -v 0 option causes rad to generate the octree without rendering any 
views.  The -V option causes rad to print out all the views for this 
scene in the standard "VIEW=" specification that rpict accepts for 
animated sequences.  These views are then rendered by rpict at very low 
resolution and discarded, filling in the ambient file as a side-effect.

I used a trick like this in the "compamb" script to compute a good -av 
setting for a particular scene.  (See the man page for compamb, which 
comes with 3.4.)

I hope the above is correct, because I'm pressing "send," now!

What would be the reason to do this? As far as I can tell, rad runs 
an overture calc (at 64x64 pixels/view) for each view specified in 
the .rif file, just before each specified view calculation.  What am 
I missing this time?

Hi,
=20
I've been using Radiance on and off for about 7 years on a variety of
platforms.  I am getting going again after a bit of a hiatus and was
interested in what machines are currently thought of as providing the
fastest rendering times.  I have Radiance running on OSX and Linux
boxes, but they are older G3 and Xeon 500 cpus.  Anyone have any
thoughts? =20
=20
Thanks,
=20

Robert-

Have a peek at these urls:

http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/~pbourke/radiance/benchrad/

http://mark.technolope.org/pages/rad_bench.html

The latter (which is based on the former's tests) has 
some timings for the latest hardware, including 
Powerbooks (G4) running OSX.  Interesting reading.
