Professional photographic stores have them--they're a printing tool--or 
you can mail-order them.  Where are you in the world are you?

Hey, Greg, have you considered adding ICC color profile support to some 
Radiance components, perhaps the PNG image conversion program?  That 
would allow Radiance users to make use of the tools that the various 
commerical graphic arts software people have developed; MacOS X and some 
Windows users would--if their systems were properly set up--get the 
ability to print color predictably.  (Not sure if there's direct 
PostScript support for ICC color profiles.)

Message-ID: <200211021648.gA2Gmok07655@darkside-animation.com>

Hi!

I am back working on my image maps.. and still in trouble. While I finally 
know how to do the transformations of my image maps, I have some problems 
with the different types of modifiers radiance offers.

First, I have a limited set of photographs that are to become imagemaps. I 
have some of rather good quality in black/whithe, showing the complete 
objetcs' surfaces. I would like to map these onto the objects in my scene.

Than, I have some pictures which give me color values (they are 
color-corrected), but which don't show the complete surfaces. So I cannot use 
them as patterns.

So which modifier should I use? If I use colorpict, I get grey surfaces (as 
the gray colorpict is mapped ON the material?). I would like to use 
brightdata, but how do I convert my grayscale image into the data-format I 
would need? Is this possibile at least?

One last possibility might be to use the color information from the color 
corrected pictures and apply this color to the greyscale-images. Is this 
possible with the radiance tools (e.g. pcomb)?

Thank you, have a nice weekend, CU,

Lars.

Hi Lars,

If you apply a colorpict using a grayscale image, you only get gray 
modifications to your material color.  If that material has color, then 
you will get a brightness modification to the color specified in the 
material primitive.  I don't know of any reliable procedures for taking 
color information in a subset of an image and extrapolating it into the 
surrounding image.  If your color image only covers a fraction of your 
surface, you are not going to be able to get color for the rest of it 
by combining this somehow with a complete grayscale image.

Color in rendering is an interesting problem.  The main source of color 
mismatches is going to be the relationship between the scene illuminant 
and the surface reflectances, which is of course ignored by ICC 
profiles.  The color space used by Radiance is close to the sRGB 
primaries, but not exactly those.  To convert to sRGB from a standard 
Radiance picture, use the following command:

	% ra_xyze -r -p .64 .33 .30 .15 .06 .313 .329 stand.pic | ra_tiff -g 
2.2 - srgb.tif

 From there, you should be able to print and get reliable color results 
on most systems, including Macs and PCs, since they assume sRGB given 
no other information.

However, the point I was trying to make was unless you have very 
carefully rendered your scene in order to arrive at the standard 
Radiance color space, these sorts of manipulations are futile.  To read 
in greater detail how to compute color correctly, including full 
spectral effects, see the recent paper I wrote with Elena 
Vileshin-Eydelberg:

	http://viz.cs.berkeley.edu/gwlarson/papers/egwr02/

This covers important issues such as white balance and optimal 
rendering color spaces.  Radiance can render in any RGB space you 
choose -- they are just three separate color channels as far as the ray 
tracer is concerned.

-Greg

P.S.  Have you ever taken a look at the ICC specification?  Eeeeeyuckkk!

Hi Roland,

yeap,- mailman is a bit picky about the poster's sending address, it
wants exactly the registered one. With firewalls and a central mail
management at large sites, that is not always the normalized receiving
one, as you found. To circumvent this, subscribe twice and disable
receiving mails on the second one. Two or three people on the list use
it that way.
The easiests way to configure options for an account is by the web
interface,  it's the last form entry at

http://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radiance-general
enter your second (dummy) email address, than select "Disable mail
delivery", enter password and select "Submit my changes"

So mailman accepts your multiple sending addresses, but you get postings
from the list only once.
 
Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause, the good side is that we've
kept the list spam resistant so far.

regards
Peter

Message-ID: <25379.1038356089@www55.gmx.net>

Hi List!

I am playing around with the vt-settings of rpict. I have the panotools
installed, and as I had some cylindrical projection renderings (rpict -vtc ), I
was quite happy with the results when viewing them in ptviewer. However, I
don't know which projection type is needed to get the sphere-projection that
ptviewer seams to support as well. Using -vta gives strange results, and the
fisheye limits me to 180 degrees, so I won't be able to turn around?

I wonder if there are others using ptviewer with radiance pictures, maybe
the answer is too simple to find ;-) If not, I will have to investigate this
deeper - I am quite new to panoramas and I am using them only as a tool to get
an overview of the scenes I am currently building.

CU, Lars.

BTW, do you know about good ressources on using make to do rendering? I know
the example files from radsite, and I know the gnu-make documentation, but
is there anybody who has done some more work on this? I am developing my own
makefile templates at the moment, but I have still lots of problems as some
aspects of radiance differ from the standard build process.

Hmmm.  Using make to do your renderings?  This is interesting.  I 
remember Raphael showing some examples of his make-based stuff 
at the Workshop, and thought that was interesting.  Being a UNIX 
newbie I barely understand makefile scripts that *other* people wrote, 
never thought of doing my own.  

Question:  Why aren't you using rad?  

rad does a lot of expert-level (program author-level) thinking about 
your model for you, and sets a lot of the myriad switches correctly, 
based on three global assumptions: "quality, detail, and variability".  
(see radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/rad.pdf for the full lowdown.) 

I have been building shell scripts around rad and it's working ok for the 
moment.  I am in the midst of rewriting a script to better serve my 
needs, as sometimes the rad rendering pipeline is not what what you 
need, but the ability of rad to intelligently set rendering parameters for 
you is a powerful one, and can be (ugh, I hate this use of the word...) 
"leveraged" in your shell scrips even if you simply use it to determine 
those parameters.  You could have rad determine the rendering 
parameters and pipe it to a "settings variable".  Then call rpict or 
rtrace or whatever and reference the settings via the @optfile 
statement.  You can even tweak the settings with the RENDER= 
line(s) in your rif file, which can be manipulated by the shell script with 
sed, or whatever, and... well you get the idea.

I'm interested to hear everyone's thoughts on the use of make vs. 
shell scripts.  Since I'm more of a user than a programmer, I 
gravitated to shell scripts because they are really just regurgitated 
commands, which is the way I tend to think.  But if the "next level" is 
make, then I'm all ears.  What are you all using out there in the real 
world?

I am using make here for several reasons. First, only using rad would not be 
sufficient, as I build documentation (from docbook), convert the model 
(dxf2rad) and mappings (ra_tiff, normpat), build octrees that are used as 
instances etc with make. And shell scripts tend to get more and more 
complicated if you add objects and "features" later, what is what we are 
currently doing here. With make, you add simply one more target. And it does 
check a lot of requirements for me, e.g. I don't have to run octree if I do a 
"make doc".

Besides, I was simply curious in using some of the well known tools in this 
context, make is one example ;-)

CU, Lars.

Hi Lars,

Rob has some good tips about using rad to generate rendering options 
using the OPTFILE setting, and I use this feature a lot, myself.  There 
are many ways to run the rad command, and the man page is the best 
place to look for understanding these.  In its most basic form, it acts 
like a simple makefile to build an octree, optionally running mkillum, 
and maintain a set of rendered and filtered pictures.

However, if you're doing a set of runs over different lighting 
configurations, scene alternatives, etc., you often need a lot more 
than rad can offer in terms of scene building.  I sometimes use a 
makefile to maintain the various octrees I use based on scene input, 
then employ a rad input file that specifies only the OCTREE setting -- 
no explicit scene files.  This can also be specified on the rad command 
line, so a single rad input file can suffice for many scene 
alternatives.

For generating animations, the ranimate program does a reasonable job, 
though it really needs updating for running animations over a network 
now that rsh no longer exists....

With regard to fisheye projections, the -vta option can go up to a 360 
degree field of view, where you get a circular image whose 
circumference is essentially a single value corresponding to the 
direction opposite the -vd parameter.  I don't know anything about 
ptviewer, or the kinds of projections it uses.  You may need to write a 
script and pass it to rtrace with the -fac (and -x & -y) options to 
take ray origin and direction on the input and produce a color picture 
on the output.  Using this method, you can get any projection onto a 
rectangular image that you can describe mathematically.

Message-ID: <BD8F5E6A-0232-11D7-BFED-00306540F848@lmi.net>

Hi Gurneet,

There really needs to be a FAQ on generating animation paths.  Peter 
Apian-Bennewitz wrote a program called rshow that may be used to 
interactively walk through a space using OpenGL rendering, and has 
options for storing keyframes and generating view sequences, which may 
then be rendered in batch mode or using ranimate.

I often choose keyframes myself in rview (or the new rholo program), 
utilizing the "view" or 'V' commands to output views at desired points 
along the animation path.  These may then be constructed into a path 
using a spline generator or the spline.cal program that may be found in 
ray/src/cal/cal in the radiance distribution.  You take the views 
output by rview or rholo, which look like so (these are not commands -- 
they are views stored by rview into a file):

rview -vtv -vp 5.46 15.5 4.2 -vd 0.91674 0.347628 -0.196833 -vu 0 0 1 
-vh 60 -vv 49 -vs 0 -vl 0 -t 1
rview -vtv -vp 10.5 15.6 4.2 -vd 0.9896 -0.1408 -0.0294619 -vu 0 0 1 
-vh 60 -vv 49 -vs 0 -vl 0 -t 2
rview -vtv -vp 20.4 13.7 4.2 -vd 0.680414 -0.680414 -0.272166 -vu 0 0 1 
-vh 60 -vv 49 -vs 0 -vl 0 -t 4

The -t options at the end were added manually, indicating the expected 
distance (in seconds) between the previous frame and this one.  These 
options may be added within rview may appending them to the view 
command, like so:

: view key.vf -t 2

Once you have the above file (key.vf), you can create a format file for 
rcalc to extract the values you are interested in, and pass these to 
the tabfunc program to get them into the form you need for spline.cal.  
Create a file called "key.fmt" that contains the following single line:

rview -vtv -vp ${px} ${py} ${pz} -vd ${dx} ${dy} ${dz} -vu 0 0 1 -vh 
${vh} -vv ${vv} -vs 0 -vl 0 -t ${t}

Then, run the following command to extract the desired values from your 
keyframe file and put them into a form that may be passed to rcalc as a 
.cal file:

% rcalc -i key.fmt -e 
'$1=recno;$2=px;$3=py;$4=pz;$5=dx;$6=dy;$7=dz;$8=vh;$9=vv;$10=t' key.vf 
\
	| tabfunc Px Py Pz Dx Dy Dz H V T > key.cal

This new file, "key.cal", may then be used with rcalc to generate a set 
of desired inbetween views, spaced evenly in time.  If your total sum 
of times is 30 seconds, for example, and you want to render 10 
frames/sec, you might use the following command to generate the 
individual frame views for ranimate:

% cnt 300 | rcalc -o key.fmt -f key.cal -f spline.cal -e 't=$1/10' \
	-e 
'px=s(Px);py=s(Py);pz=s(Pz);dx=s(Dx);dy=s(Dy);dz=s(Dz);vh=s(H);vv=s(V)' 
 > anim.vf

In this command, I have used the same "key.fmt" file to generate the 
animation views, but you may want to produce something slightly 
different, which had only the changing view point and direction, for 
example.  The above sequence allows you to vary the view position, 
direction, and zoom, but does not permit the up vector to change.  This 
is rarely needed, but if you do have a tilting camera, you can always 
modify the commands to include this information.

I hope this is enough to get you started.  Another excellent place to 
look for tips is Peter's chapter on animation in "Rendering with 
Radiance."

Hi All,

Quick note on ranimate. It should be possible to use ssh instead of rsh 
by specifying it to ranimate. Ssh does take a little work to set up 
correctly for trusted logins (ie logins that do not require a password 
which is what ranimate needs) but it is possible to do and seems to work 
fine. I have done so in the past for ranimate, but it has been a while. 
I will forego all the arguments about why you should be using ssh anyway 
in place of rsh, they are readily available elsewhere...;->

Regards,

-Jack

PS: Thanks for the reference, however the interactive path editing was
build into the older GL version of rshow running on SGI's IRIX, the
Open-GL version is still waiting for this feature.

on a per-user basis: on local machine, generate public/privat key pair
(ssh-keygen -t rsa, optionally with empty passphrase), add public key
(~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub) to authorized key file (~/.ssh/authorized_keys) on
remote machine. Then ssh acts as direct (and enhanced) replacement for
rsh. I wouldn't recommend solely host-based authorisation since it
sabotages core ideas of public key authorisation (unless it is used
additionally to per-user auth).
