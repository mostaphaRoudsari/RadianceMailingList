Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance for Mac OS X
Message-ID: <B997A280.457%burrellg@mac.com>

I see there is a Radiance binary compilation for Mac OS X.  I'm only
slightly familiar with the BSD system that  OSX is based on, and could
really use some help getting started.

Is there an "Installing Radiance on Mac OSX For Dummies" web page out there
somewhere?
Once I get it installed, I'm fine, as I've used Radiance for DOS/Windows and
linux before.

Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks,

Hi Galen,

I just uploaded a new copy of the Radiance binaries for Mac OS X v10.2 
(Jaguar), since the old 10.1 binaries don't seem to work on the new 
version of the operating system.  There are no "Dummy" pages for 
Radiance, and no dummies as far as I know who can do anything with the 
software...  We really should have some quick introduction somewhere, I 
suppose.  Right now, the README file that comes with the main 
distribution is about all we have, and that's probably out of date.

Anyway, to install Radiance on your system, just grab the main 
distribution from the website Download link 
(http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance of course), then download the MacOS X 
binaries from the same place.  Copy the binaries to /usr/local/bin or 
someplace like that, and the libraries (ray/lib in the main 
distribution) to /usr/local/lib/ray.  This is explained on the download 
page as well.

Unfortunately, there is a small snag in this procedure, which is that 
it fails to install certain critical library files, such as 
"rayinit.cal", which are normally copied as part of the makeall build 
process.  Therefore, it's often best to run "makeall install" anyway on 
your system, to make sure you get everything, in which case the 
binaries aren't really needed, unless of course you don't have the 
developer tools that come free with Mac OS X installed on your system.

To manually copy all the library files, just execute the following 
commands after you've unpacked the ray directory:

% cd ray
% cp -rp lib /usr/local/lib/ray
% cp -p src/*.cal /usr/local/lib/ray

That should do it!

I for one find this useful.  Coming from Lightscape, I'm quite used to 
being able to create renderings that have invisible backfaces, as you 
have shown in Figure 4 of this new tech note.  It's a useful technique 
in certain situations, and now I know I can apply it to Radiance 
renderings as well.  Thanks John, and to Greg for supplying the brain.  =8-)

I have played with similar ideas in the past, thinking about how
to implement such a feature for Rayfront. The thing that caused
me to push it into the long term queue was that I found no really
elegant way to emulate the pixel sampling and jittering of rpict,
short of actually modifying it.

Nonetheless, I think that the concept as such is the right way to
go. I'm just waiting for one or both of "-vcm <modifier>" and
"-vco <octree>" to be implemented directly in rpict, which would
preserve all the functionality...  ;)

Hello, here pillo with some problems...

the topic is luminaire modeling.

1) i created .dat file (from unknown file format received) with=20
luminous intensities (cd) for 1000 lm flux.
2 angles declared explicitly. (phi & theta are in the right order...)


2) i created .rad file with:

1 sphere (surface equals to .0056419m @ 10m hight ) as light geometry
the ground @0m height


the light material has this definition:

void brightdata dist
5 corr source.dat source.cal src_phi2 src_theta
0
1 2681

dist light point
0
0
3 1 1 1

where 2681 is from: (1/179 * 48000lm/1000lm * 10000)
i m working with 1 * 400W SAT  and a sphere of radius equals to=20
.0056419....)

NOW THE QUESTION:
i used rtrace to calculate orizontal illuminance (echo "x y z 0 0 1" |=20=

rtrace -I+ *.oct):
the point under the light  (theta is 0) gives the same value  i=20
computed manually:
illuminance =3D intensity/height^2 * cos theta where theta =3D 0)

the bad thing is that points with different angles give not right=20
values ( i tried 45=B0 and 30=B0 that are from .dat file)
(i got an error 10% plus or minus)

what's the matter???
some rtrace's settings.... what else?

thanks for every kind of advice you'll gave me

Message-ID: <200209191817.g8JIHKk20615@darkside-animation.com>

Hi!

I have problems with macbethcal. I use it with a scanned photo of the 
macbeth-target, as I have some mappings and material definitions to do. But I 
don't reasonable results. If I use the "debug"-option (-d debug.pic), the 
right side of the square (the "calibrated" one ) is black, while I don't get 
warnings by macbethcal itself.

How much tolerance concerning the color fields of the macbeth chart does 
mabethcal provide, e.g how big is the region per color field the program uses 
for it's calculation? And is it ok to have variatons per field, does it 
calculate an average color per field?

Thank You, CU, Lars.

Hi,

I tried some of my better pictures, and I found that the source image was 
simply too bad... I was able to use macbethcal with my other pictures. So I 
only wonder why I am warned if some values are out of range, but I get a 
completely bad .cal-file with the unuseable source file without warning.

I am currently trying to install Radiance in XDarwin on a Macintosh 
running Mac OSX 10.2.  I am completely new to UNIX, so my question may 
be simplistic.  Please bare with me.  If this question is 
inappropriate, then please let me know, and I will not fill your 
inboxes.

I read Greg Ward's response to Galen Burrell, and tried following the 
direction.

When I try running the ./makeall install script, I always come up with 
errors.
When I try copying the files manually, I also run into problems

I'm trying to install into /usr/local/radiance

With the cp -rp lib /usr/local/radiance/lib/ray command, I get a 
message saying that the file is identical.
With the cp -p src/*.cal /usr/local/radiance/lib/ray command, I get a 
message saying that there was no match.

I'm sure it's my ignorance that's causing the problem.

Again, I'm a complete newbie, so I really don't know what I'm doing, 
but am willing to learn and experiment.

Can you point me to a resource that will help me understand the install 
process?  I understand that my question is really remedial, but I know 
I'll understand better the installation process under UNIX through this 
task of having to install Radiance.


Thanks in advance for your time and patience.

hi, i m pillo
and i am using radiance on a ibook.... (with osx..) (and on  dual 
athlon linux box...)
i m not a beginner, but not so more...
what you can do (IF you are a mac user like me, with little unix 
knowledge):

(ELSE wait for BETTER ANSWER...)



0)log on your system with root permissions (watch out! you are root... )

1) install xdarwin (it seems you did already, anyway you can get it 
from http://mrcla.com/XonX/)

2)get tinkertool to view hidden files (so you can use aqua GUI to move 
and copy files ;-))))) (get it from 
http://www.bresink.de/osx/TinkerTool2.html)

3)copy the files (binaries precompiled from ftp @radiste) into 
'usr/x11r6/bin/'  (i suggest to backup your current 'usr/x11r6/bin ' 
directory...BEFORE!!!)

4)then copy the libraries to 'usr/local/lib/ray/' (you should create 
'ray' directory before..) (make it readable for others user)

5)copy manuals into 'man' directory (usr/share/man/) without 
overwriting pre-existing directories... (back up BEFORE doing anything)

6)login as normal users... open xdarwin... enjoy with radiance!!!!

PS. may be you should change permissions to read library directory (and 
to find rayinit.cal)  (you can use command 'chmod' .. 'man chmod')

i hope my email was useful.
regards,
pillo
(quite beginner)

Totally appropriate.  You will find some very intelligent users on ths 
list, who gratefully don't mind the cooasional beginner question. 
Believe me, I should know.  I was a LINUX loser for years, barely able 
to copy a file to the location I wanted.  When OS X came out, it made 
life a WHOLE LOT easier....  and I'm still struggling.  Hang in there. 
May I recommend "MacOSX Unleashed" for a lot of useful info on UNIX in 
the OS X vein.

> I read Greg Ward's response to Galen Burrell, and tried following the

I don't have all my old email regarding this installation process, but I 
*did* install Radiance for OSX without compiling.  Twice, in fact. 
Problem is, the last time I did it was a while ago, so I forget a lot. 
I *do* need to get the 10.2 binaries going on my system since I just 
upgraded to Jaguar myself.

As a start may I suggest trying to re-copy the stuff to the correct 
locations?  Note you should drop down to a shell (load Terminal) and do 
this from the command line, and do it as root.  Type "sudo su", return. 
  You will be asked for the administrator password.  Now you can copy 
the binbaries to /usr/local/bin.  You also have to copy the library 
files, but as Greg mentioned I think if you run the makeall install the 
script will copy those files where they need to do for you, even if the 
compile procedure fails.  Doesn't matter, because you can then copy 
Greg's compiled binaries to /usr/local/bin per my instructions above. 
When you're done you chould "change back" to your normal user by typing 
sudo (username).

You also need to add that directory to your path statement in your 
.cshrc file. Again, I can give mre details as I dig up my old emails on 
this stuff, but the experts here may beat me to it because they can do 
this stuff in their sleep (which I find amazing).

Subject: [Radiance-general] colour correction with macbeth
Message-ID: <13498.1032782157@www51.gmx.net>

Hi!

I am using macbethcal to correct some images for use in radiance. I am
scanning color negatives with Linocolor, which does the colour inversion for me.

Some of my scans give good results by simply applying the
macbethcal-correction to them. Others are too bad to produce a good .cal-file. E.g. some have
evidently too much blue. I found that doing a "auto correction" in photoshop
before using macbethcal gives better results. But is this ok (I do the color
correction on the area of the picture containing the colour checker as well as
on the material / texture I want to get, of course)? Or is it "forbidden" to
do anything besides the pcomb-correction?

Hi ---

I've been trying to render large images using rpict_random and have been
getting the following error:

rpict_random: consistency - address not found in avlmemi

I read your previous messages regarding this and know that I need
to recompile ambient.c with the -Dtracktime=0 switch.  Unfortunately, I
don't really know how to do this.  Which rmake file do I put this command
in?  Where do I need to put it?

I'm new to UNIX so I have been using the precompiled binaries that I
downloaded from the website.  I have now downloaded the source code but I
don't want to ruin my existing files by compiling them incorrectly.  As I
understand it, I should compile a new version of rpict_random by:

(1) adding the -Dtracktime=0 command to the Rmakefile script that is in
ray/src/rt [although I don't know where to put it]
(2) and then running that Rmakefile script.

I'm guessing that this will produce new executables for the ray-tracing
programs, which I can then place in my ray/radbin_lnx directory.  Is this
correct?

Sorry for the rather basic level of these questions.  Radiance is
brilliant, I use it for generating realistic stimuli for my psychology
experiments!

Best wishes,
Roland

Hi Roland !

What is rpict_random ?? Never heard of it, maybe I missed something.
(probably a normal rpict compiled with -DMC ??)...

For the compiling issue: If you already have the sources, then just
start the normal installation script (follow the README). You will be
asked for a directory, where to put the new executives in. Specify a new
one for that, separate from the one in which your precompiled binaries
are residing. So you won't spoil them no matter what happens during the
compiling of the new ones. Later, you can move them to the place you
want.

Concerning the -Dtracktime=0 switch: You can set this in the rmake
script, as you already know. Just put it among the other -D's at the top
of the file. The ominous rmake resides in the directory where all the
Radiance executives can be found, i.e. the one you specified for putting
the executives in during the installation procedure. During installation
you will be asked if you want to edit the rmake script, this is a good
chance to put in the critical switch, too.

There is one pitfall when you do recompilings later, (without the
installation script): Then the rmake will be searched in the directories
specified by the 'path' environment variable, like every other
executive. So if you gave a 'dummy' directory during installation, you
have to copy the rmake into your ray/radbin_lnx directory, too.

Having done this, you can do recompilngs of just what module you want by 
entering the source subdirectory and typing - example:

(in ray/src/rt:)
$> rmake rpict


Good luck !

Carsten

Perfect! Obviously you're not THAT new to UNIX! :^)

Subject: [Radiance-general] [newbie question] trouble creating coloured window glass
Message-ID: <001101c26669$fa201140$0201a8c0@lucifer>

Hi,

First, an apology if this is not the right place to post this kind of
question, but it was the only suitable-looking mailing list I could find.

I'm new to Radiance, although I think I've got the hang of the basics now.
I'm working on an archaeological model---an Anglo-Saxon church building. The
problem is creating some coloured glass for a window. I have created a
successful sky file, and the sunlight pours through the window (when there's
no glass) to leave a window-shaped highlight on the floor and illuminating
the rest of the room via ambient bouncing. When I tried adding a
window-shaped polygon and assigned it the "glass" material using 0.96 0.96
0.96 as my rgb transmissivities (as advised in the online manual) everything
was still fine. However, when I specified the following:

void glass blue_glass
0
0
3  0.2 0.2 0.96

the light entered the window, but instead of appearing blue inside the room,
it was a very low-intensity white. Experimentation seemed to indicate that
the light would always be white, and that it seems to adopt an intensity
related to the *lowest* of the values 0.2 0.2 0.96, ie 0.2. (Indeed, 0 0 1
gives no light at all, not blue light.) I've since tried all sorts of
things, including the following "illum" approach recommended in the online
intro chapter to the "Rendering with Radiance" book:

skyfunc brightfunc window_dist
2 winxmit winxmit.cal
0
0
void glass window_glass
0
0
3  0.96 0.96 0.96

window_dist illum RAL5013_Cobalt_blue
1 window_glass
0
3  0.2 0.2 0.96

but the light was still white and not blue. Then I tried using the "trans"
material with some success, in that the light coming in was blue! But I lose
the nice window-shaped sun highlight on the floor---the blue light is just
diffusely spread around. Indeed, when I use no ambient bounces, I just get a
completely black image (instead of a white, window-shaped highlight inside
an otherwise completely black image, which is what I was getting when I used
"glass"). Changing the values for the "trans" material doesn't seem to
correct this.

What's more, I'm totally guessing the values to use, which kind of defeats
the point seeing as I'm trying to make visually accurate images. I'm sure
the correct values are tied up with the "glass" material---if only I could
get it to be coloured!

I'd be really grateful for any help with this.

Many thanks,
