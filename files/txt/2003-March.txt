Subject: [Radiance-general] Using spline.cal to create camera paths?
Message-ID: <29833.1046853355@www37.gmx.net>

Hi List!

I am currently trying to do some first steps in animation with radiance. I
did some search in the list's archives, as well as older radiance digests and
some basic descriptions about camera path interpolation in general. What I
found to be useable (I am not a maths expert;-) was the method described by
Greg Ward using rcalc, spline.cal and cnt to generate a view file from key
point.

So I defined a list containing 15 key points and directions, processed this
with rcalc and spline.cal, made 150 views out of this and was quite happy to
see all this was working (after having some trouble with the format-files
used by rcalc first). Than, I used rpict to render my 150 frames, and I was
quite happy with the speed on my old machine (the use of an ambient file shows
it's benefits here).

However, I didn't really get the camera path I expected to result from the
key points. I know that there are lots of parameters that define a path, not
only the key points. The problem here is that the interpolation let me to a
path that doesn't even come close to the points. So I need a method to bind the
spline generated by spline.cal closer to the defined points, making the
spline less smooth. How can I do this? Should I define more or less points? And
is there a parameter in spline.cal that can be used here?

Thank you, CU, Lars.

hi,
i am doing a simulation of a school, the school has got many coutyards and
green area
, so for that i need a large variety of plants and trees.
it would be really helpful if anybody could give me a link from where i can
downloads
different trees and plants , or if there is some command or routine in
radiance(linux)to make green plants
.also if somebody could suggest how should i reprsent grass in the

Hi!

3dcafe.com has a lot of free dxf and 3ds models of trees and plant, which can 
be imported into radiance. If you use them as instances and exclude them from 
ambient calculation, you can use lots of these detailed geometries. Take a 
look at the rpict options for this, don't even think about doing ambient 
calculation of detailed trees' geometries! The placement of tree and plant 
instances can be done in a very comfortable way if you use a markers file, 
you simply make a cad-triangle and copy this to the desired locations, using 
one layer for every plant/tree type, rotate some of them randomly and take a 
look at replmarks. BTW, if you have access to rayfront, this tool handles 
marker files in a frontend.

However, the representation of grass might be a bit difficult.... they HAVE 
3d-geometry ;-) But maybe one should use a cal file to create the grass 
geometry, or does it make sense to get brd-data for grass???

Good luck, CU, Lars.

This is puzzling, as the Catmull-Rolm spline used in spline.cal is 
designed to pass exactly through the key frame positions.  Are you sure 
everything is working properly?  Did you check your generated .cal file 
to make sure it has the right values in the right places?  You should 
see something like this:

Px(x):select(x,79,72.3046,71.1568,71.1568,71.1568);
Py(x):select(x,24,23.2029,23.1347,23.1347,23.1347);
Pz(x):select(x,5.5,5.5,5.5,5.5,5.5);
Dx(x):select(x,-0.970143,-0.970142,-0.990371,-0.977998,-0.999862);
Dy(x):select(x,-0.194029,-0.194029,-0.0484078,0.0306398,-0.0091765,);
Dz(x):select(x,-0.145521,-0.145521,-0.129696,-0.206351,0.0138471);
T(x):select(x,0,2.74756,1.09528,0.658805,0.765425);

Each select call has the same number of arguments, corresponding to the 
number of keyframes you entered, and the Nth argument of each should 
correspond to your Nth keyframe value for that variable.

There is a tool called xfrog (search for this name),  which generates very nice
trees which you can export to .obj files. You have a trial period of 1 month
using xfrog, that is enough time to make some nice trees for yourself.

Good luck,

Hmm.. that makes it easy to check.

Not any more ;-)

Yes, everything seams to be ok here. I still might have used the cal file in
a wrong way in the last step when I generated the views. I will repeat the
procedure with fewer key frames and frames to check this last step. Is it ok
to specify one spline with lots of control points in general, or should I use
multiple splines? I am not sure if my 15 points are already too many controls
to generate a path as I expected?

The really important information for me is that the spline is to go through
the points I define, I didn't know that before and will be able to try some
more paths now. Thank you!

CU Lars.

Message-ID: <A2B098B4E624D511BED900508BB92A57025874DC@exmsb02.curtin.edu.au>

Hello All,

Being a frustrated radiance user in a Microsoft operating system preferred
university, I have struck out. As part of my teaching load in the Faculty
and the Department of Architecture and Interior Architecture, I have
developed bootable PC CDROM containing Linux and Radiance 3.4.1 (patched).
This CDROM is distributed to undergraduate students taking my third year
Building Science unit in the Architecture and Interior Architecture courses.
The students are able to boot from CD in the Faculties computer laboratories
plus use the CD on home computers. There is zero software loaded on the
computers hard drive, in fact no hard drive is required  + no need for
ancillary software eg AutoCAD to be loaded. The faculties computers do have
AutoCAD but would the students home computers?

After prompting from Greg Ward, I have made available a copy of an
unpublished paper at
http://puffin2.curtin.edu.au/restricted/mcminn/papers/Flexible-Learning.pdf

This paper outlines the development of a bootable CDROM that contains a full
operating system plus all required software for the teaching of Radiance, a
sophisticated lighting simulation package. Lighting simulation programs are
vital tools for Architects and Interior Architects to visualise lighting
schemes for projects. The Radiance "package is a capable of producing
physically correct results and images that are indistinguishable from real
photographs" (Jacobs &  Solomon 2002, pg 3) This combination of application,
operating system and CDROM allows students to gain experience, via a
realistic simulation of the physical reality of the building project without
needing to install new software and applications.

The CDROM method of delivery is in its second year, we had 80+ students
using it in 2002. In 2003 the numbers are currently 96 students. The
products of their submissions were equal or better than previous years using
installed partitions, etc. Comments from the tutor, indicate that the class
experienced less computer related problems than previous years.

I would be interested in comments on my project. There are many avenues yet
to be explored.

That was the most important information to me, as I was able to search for 
the error. The cal-file was ok, I had made an error in the last step, 
(generating the frames' views with cnt and rclac) where I had a wrong time 
sum. The path is nice and smooth now, and it all isn't that difficult ;-)))

Thank you, CU, Lars.

It turns out that Greg Ward's solution proposed in his message of 31 
January 2003 is the solution after all. I have now run a number of tests
with two different models and varying numbers of processes and, hence,
varying numbers of processors sharing processes with other programs
running on the same machine. In no case has the bug reared its ugly head.

A P.S. to Thomas' message -- we corresponded off-line and determined 
with the help of his sysadmin that he was originally running the old

he thought.  I asked him to make sure that the new version was indeed 
working before he posted a retraction.

That sounds like a really great idea.  I was and worked with students at the University of Kansas trying to help them learn Radiance.  It seemed that half the semester and much of their frustration was spent working out the bugs in their home installations rather than learning the actual program!

Hi Terry!

I am a research fellow at the Bartlett School of Architecture at UCL and 
have come across your post regarding the "Hard Drive-less Radiance for PC". 
I think it is a god send and I wanted to try it out over here. I have 
downloaded the iso image and burnt a disc. I am running into problems 
booting into the iso image because of missing user info: I have not found 
(or missed spotting) any documentation regarding the specific login info 
required. Is there a root password for the bootable cd or a set of standard 
users in the iso image?

Many Thanks for your help and for making this iso image available to the 
radiance community!

Hello
Newbie here! I know enough about Unix to be dangerous
Ive DL'd the binaries and distribution.
I've read posts about installing, and I'm still confused.
According to the readme, it says type

That did'nt work, so I typed 
[sudo ./makeall install -- (I know sudo is superuser do - but not sure why
the ./ for makeall)

It got me further - asking for places to install the binaries and the lib
Where do you want the executables [/usr/local/bin]?  I hit return  so far so
good
Where do you want the library files [/usr/local/lib/ray]?  I hit return

So I mkdir  called lib inside the local directory - thinking it will find
lib and make a ray directory
Where do you want the library files [/usr/local/lib/ray]? /usr/lib
should I have made a ray dir as well?

Install library files now [n]? y

not knowing what that all means, I type "n"

I get lots of errors

Does it matter where I am when I install? I tried it from the ray directory

other posts say to copy everything manually into bin and lib directories -
have'nt tried that yet.

Thanks for helping a unix dummy.

The ./ means "run this program right here in the current directory, even 
tho it's not on my search path."  And that stupid little period eluded 
me for a long time.

Terrance will be the authority here, but I got the impression that the 
CD contained not only a bootable Linux OS but also a set of 
pre-installed binaries for Radiance.  Did you have a look in 
/usr/local/bin to see if the radiance progs are already in there?  I'm 
pretty sure it's ready to go.

As the for root, the current directory is usually not included into the PATH
for obvious security reasons (if you have ./ in your root path, and a clever
guy has put a little script called "ls" into a directory that simply
contains "rm -R /", you would be surprised ;-), you will usually have to specify the
path to scripts in non-standard directories.

Why /usr/lib, you should have kept the default /usr/local/lib/ray (after
creating /usr/local/lib... you have a funny Linux distribution if there hasn't
been a /usr/local/lib before).

No, the makeall script will do this.

Hmmm that doesn't look like a Linux / x86 setting.... There is something
"preconfigured" that you don't want. Do a ./makeall clean first. If that doesn't
help (the makeall should ask you about your system / environment, e.g.
Linux, Solaris, AIX, BSD...), touch the makeall script (afaik, if the script has
been "modified", e.g. by setting the modification time, it will go through the
whole configuration procedure - else it will just recompile).

> I get lots of errors

Of course, that's not for your Linux box.

I hope you will get a working radiance soon. I wonder if we will see a
standard installation for radiance one day (make config, make, make test, make
install, or even a configure script).

BTW: if you have successfully installed radiance for the first time, the
next might be to try some optimizations with gcc (e.g. -O3 -ffast-math
-mcpu=YourCpu)... But that will be the next step...

Good luck, CU, Lars.

Yes - OSX - I Downloaded from the Radiance website
 version 3.4
I actually DL'd both  rad3R4.tar.gz  and  radbin_osx.tar.gz
But it sound like I didn't need the rad3R4, since it has already been
compiled as radbin_osx?

I DL'd and unpacked all the files in a radbin_osx  folder

Are you saying I'm good to go? I didn't need to compile. (I actaully thought
I was installing, not compiling!)
I don't plan on doing anything groundbreaking, just poking around and
looking at some sample scenes.

Thanks for all the help.
Lets see if I can get it to work now.

Rob Fitz

Oh jeez, if I had studied the error messages (or the subject line) 
better, I'd have realized that too.  Sorry!  But I believe the main 
problem is Terrance's CD is intended to be a free-standing unit, and 
does not require compilation of anything.  At least that's the idea, I 
think.

  

Rob F., if you *are* in fact running OS X, then yes follow Greg's 
advice, by all means!  I got a Mac last January specifically to run OS X
(and in turn, Radiance), and it has changed my life.With OS X and the 
pre-compiled binaries, you can quickly get to work with the tutorials 
instead of jacking around with UNIX sysadminning.
That's just one of those newbie things that a UNIX guru assumes is 
common knowledge, but isn't.

As for the include files being missing, I discovered to

Bummer.  I was never able to compile Radiance on my Mac, even before the

advent of Apple's X11.  Guess I'll go straight to the binaries for 3.5. 
  (and Rob F., if you go that route, it's still a good idea to grab the 
source tree and have it around, because there's all kinds of useful 
documentation and stuff in there).

In my recent post on this thread, I somehow assumed that Rob F. was 
using the bootable CD-ROM that Terrance recently posted about.  Now I 
see that he is not.  I also have absolutely no idea which synapses were 
firing and in what order, for me to have assumed that from Rob's post he 
was using that CD!  Sorry for any confusion this caused.

Stupid me!

When I read the word "distribution", I always think we are talking about
Linux, and right, OS 10.1.5 is OS X....

It seems that we had at least three people answer Rob's e-mail, each 
thinking his situation was slightly different.  I guess that goes to 
show just how helpful this community is!  Maybe we can ask people to 
state the specific hardware and software they're working with next 
time...

With OS X, you can just move the binaries from radbin_osx to 
/usr/local/bin (or wherever you'd like in your path), run "./makeall 
library" and you should be good to go.

Have fun!

OK, sorry about the confusion.  Yes, if you have radbin_osx you're 
pretty close:

Copy the binaries to /usr/local/bin/ray (permissions should be set 
already, but if you get "permission denied" errors when you try to run 
things, run "chmod -R a+rx /usr/local/bin/ray", sans quotes, from the 
command line).

 From the source distribution, copy the /ray/lib folder to: 
/usr/local/lib/ray

Add the radiance directory to your search path, by adding this line:

set path=(/usr/local/bin/ray $path)

... to your .cshrc file (which is in your home directory).

I think that was all I had to do to get things going on OS X.  And do 
have a look at the various documentation and sample files in the source 
folder.

Good luck!  Have fun!  Enough shouting!

Message-ID: <2F2360EE-5BDC-11D7-830E-00306540F848@lmi.net>

Well, I'm a few weeks late from my initial target, but I hope this new 
release is worth the wait.  I've uploaded the official 3.5 version of 
Radiance to the LBNL website, accessible via the main Download link 
from:

	http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance

The prominent differences between this release and 3.4 are the addition 
of ANSI-C prototypes to the core libraries, and the creation of a new 
animation program (ranimove) and a new mesh primitive (mesh).  I have 
also updated the HTML reference manual to match the troff version, and 
fixed the nasty avlmemi bug, at long last.  For full details of what 
has been changed and added since 3.4, see the release notes:

	http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/Notes/ReleaseNotes.html

Note that we have a new, OpenSource license agreement in place, also 
accessible from the Download page.  I have posted the compiled 3.5 
binaries for Mac OS X, but am waiting on others to contribute binaries 
for Linux, SGI, and Sun machines.  (Volunteers?)  I understand that it 
compiles without difficulty under Linux, but I don't have access to a 
Linux machine myself at the moment.

If you are interested in source code developments and CVS availability, 
subscribe to the radiance-dev mailing list at:

Enjoy!

Hi!  
  
While building binaries, I did some testing on the new release with some of
my  
bigger scenes. I find that the new oconv from 3.5 takes really much memory,
in  
fact, more than I have installed in my poor old k6-2 (96MB). So I cannot
build  
an octree from a scene that was fine with 3.4.1.  
  
Is this only a result of changes in the -n and -r defaults? Or ist the new
oconv  
more memory-hungry then older releases in general? I hope to get my scene 
built with the new 3.5 soon on x86,  as I will be able to tar a binary
distribution 
than.

Hi Lars,

Try running with the old -r 16384 -n 5 and see if that makes the 
difference.  I can't think what else is new, except the maximum set 
size was increased.

Message-ID: <928502AB-5E18-11D7-A86F-00306540F848@lmi.net>

If any of you Radiance users out there are running Mac OS X, I welcome 
you to download and test drive the application I've been working on in 
my spare time for the past couple of years, called Photosphere.  I just 
put together the first official release (1.0), and it's hanging off the 
Radiance website at:

	http://radsite.lbl.gov/pickup/photosphere.tar.gz

For those of you who attended last year's workshop, I gave a little 
talk on this program, which Peter has made available at radiance-online:

	http://www.radiance-online.org/radiance-workshop1/cd/Ward/HDRbrowser

(I renamed it from "Photophile" to "Photosphere" based on some 
derogatory feedback.)

In addition to providing a means to catalog and browse regular and high 
dynamic-range images (including JPEG, TIFF, Radiance, LogLuv TIFF, and 
ILM's OpenEXR format), Photosphere can also build HDR images from 
hand-held, bracketed exposures.  (This is a first, as far as I know.)  
Eventually, I hope to port this to Linux and Windows, but I'll probably 
need some help on this.  Ian Ashdown keeps saying he'll work on this, 
and I believe he will, but not until he gets a few more urgent projects 
taken care of....

Let me know if you have any questions, comments, or suggestions.  I'd 
be very happy to hear them.

Hello all, and thanks again for the new release! 3.5 compiled without issue on my Mandrake 9.0 dual-Athlon box. However I would like to make a Linux and/or Mandrake binary and/or RPM package for Radiance, but being rather new to Linux in general, don't know where to start. If anyone could point me to a on-line informative resource that discusses such things, could you be so kind as to forward it to me? Or is this even out of the question for a relative newcomer such as myself?

Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance 3.5.0 Linux-Binaries for Alpha, Intel, Sparc
Message-ID: <1648.1048533483@www10.gmx.net>

Hi ! 
 
For those without compilers ;-) 
 
I have built binaries of the new 3.5.0-release for various Linux-platforms.
The 
tarballs contain a directory called "radiance", you should copy it into /opt
and 
set two environment variables (e.g. in ~/.bashrc): RAYPATH to
/opt/radiance/lib 
and PATH to /opt/radiance/bin (of course, you must append the previous 
RAYPATH/PATH-directories... ;-). Here: 
 
export RAYPATH=/opt/radiance/lib:$RAYPATH 
export PATH=/opt/radiance/bin:$PATH 
 
I have the new path-entries before the others, to make sure to override
older 
releases of radiance. The binaries are all build on SuSE-Linux 7.x with 
2.4.x-kernels, they SHOULD work on all recent Linux distributions - however,
I 
cannot test that. The sparc and intel builds were done using gcc 2.95.3, the

alpha-build is by compaq c 6.2. 
 
So here are the links: 
 
Alpha / AXP, Linux 2.4:

http://fachschaft.pool.architektur.tu-darmstadt.de/static_html/webseiten/linuxarchitekt/Rad-Linux-Alpha-3.5.0.tar.bz2   
 
Sun Hypersparc (v8) and later, Linux 2.4:  

http://fachschaft.pool.architektur.tu-darmstadt.de/static_html/webseiten/linuxarchitekt/Rad-Linux-Hypersparc-3.5.0.tar.bz2   
 
Intel x86, Linux 2.4:

http://fachschaft.pool.architektur.tu-darmstadt.de/static_html/webseiten/linuxarchitekt/Rad-Linux-x86-3.5.0.tar.bz2   
 
I will do a gcc-3-based Solaris-build for ultrasparcs, too. However, as I
don't 
have a license of Sun's native compiler, I cannot build an optimized binary.
So 
anybody out there who could do the build with Sun Forte C??? 
 
Please tell me if the binaries are working on your systems. BTW, if you are 
going to use radiance on a regular base.. it's always better to build
software for 
your specific configuration ;-) 
 
Jeffrey: If you are going to build rpms, I think this would be great. I
personally 
think that one should build rpms for specific distributions, and I don't
have any 
experience in that, but on the long run, it would be great for new users if
tehy 
could simply pick a rpm or deb for their distribution without worrying about

PATH-settings, compilers and dependencies. I will take a look at rpm, if you
get 
any further with this, please tell me (I have SuSE and Debian systems here,
as 
well as Solaris, having its own package management). 
 
CU, Lars.

I will start by making a RPM for Mandrake Linux, what I'm currently using, if I'm able to figure it out at all :). I think that Mandrake RPM's will work within RedHat too; for Mandrake uses RedHat's package manager. But I'm assuming that, and would want to test it/have it tested prior to 'official' release.

Thanks,

Subject: [Radiance-general] rendering parameters
Message-ID: <20030326190340.48702.qmail@web20503.mail.yahoo.com>

Hello. I am trying to separate the direct and indirect
specular and indirect diffuse calculation in Radiance.
Actually, I am trying to duplicate the "artificial
separation" provided in Radiance book, plate 23.

I got a little confused with the rendering parameters:
Lets say I have an image, which has all
direct + indirect specular + indirect diffuse
computation, with parameters
-av 0.5 0.5 0.5
-ab 2
-st 0.001
INDIRECT=1

Would it be sufficient to change 
-av 0 0 0
-ab 0
-st 1
INDIRECT=0
so that I can get an image with just the direct
computations? Or do I have to change other parameters?


Accordingly, if change the ?st parameter back to
0.001; would it be give direct + indirect specular
component?

Thanks.
Ada

Hi Ada,

I think there's no way to do this correctly without understanding and 
hacking the source code in src/rt/normal.c.  That's what I had to do to 
generate this image in the first place.  If you just want a copy of the 
image, I would be happy to provide one.  You won't be able to get this 
result by altering the command line options or the material parameters 
alone.  If your specular surface(s) has zero roughness, you might be 
able to get close by rendering pictures of your scene with and without 
the specular component(s), and subracting the resulting pictures.  As 
for separating the interreflected component, the same picture 
subtraction should work between one rendered with -ab 1 -av [whatever] 
and -ab 0 -av 0 0 0.

To subtract two images:

	pcomb img1.pic -s -1 img2.pic > img1-img2.pic

The images must be rendered at the same size and resolution, setting 
the rpict parameters -pj 0 and -ps 1.  You can pass the result through 
pfilt to improve the final appearance, but I don't recommend doing it 
before.

I hope this helps.

Hello. Thank you for the answer Greg. It is very
helpful. I have one follow up question: When I set the
rendering parameters -ab 0 -av 0 0 0, I am eliminating
the interreflected component. But I still see some
reflection of the interior surfaces on my window
glazing. Since there is no interreflection, why is
this happening?

Thanks again.

Hi Ada,

I should have been more specific -- setting -ab 0 -av 0 0 0 eliminates 
_diffuse_ interreflections in the calculation -- specular reflections 
will still be present.  The only way to get rid of specular reflections 
(reliably) is to eliminate specular components from your materials.  In 
the case of a glass surface, you would have to substitute trans with a 
zero reflected component.

Doesn't -lr 0 truncate *all* interreflection, specular and diffuse?

Well...  It's never simple with Radiance, is it?  You would think that 
-lr truncates reflections, and usually it does, but you'll still get 
the direct component in there, which includes the specular highlight if 
the roughness value is non-zero.

Yeah, but that's not specular INTERreflection, which Ada was trying to
suppress. Or not? What was the original question? :^)

And just to make it a little more complicated: how does this affect
virtual sources?

Subject: [Radiance-general] Perez Sky for Daylight Simulation
Message-ID: <3E849E7F.32125.1D56AF5@localhost>

Dear Mr.Ward, 

I am student of architecture working an a daylight simulation with 
radiance, still dealing with several problems. 
I want to generate indoor illuminance values in Lux for a validation 
with measured values of an office room. 
I am working with the Perez all-weather skymodell in oder to 
calculate with a sky which is equivalent to the measured outdoor 
conditions.  
For input in gendaylit I use the measured direct-normal and diffuse-
horizontal- illuminance [W/m²]. 

# gendaylit 1 11 12.00 -a 51.30 -o -7.28 -m -15 +s -W 154 93 
# Ground ambient level: 11.1 

void light solar 
0 
0 
3 9.684e+005 9.684e+005 9.684e+005 

solar source sun 
0 
0 
4 0.156133 -0.946576 0.282165 0.533000 

void brightfunc skyfunc 
2 skybright perezlum.cal

3.202346  0.012553 0.156133 -0.946576 0.282165  

Then I add the sky description from gensky by preparing the octree 

skyfunc glow sky_glow 
0 
0 
4 1 1 1  0 
sky_glow source sky 
0 
0 
4 0 0 1 180 

rtrace is running with the option -I and  the following parameters  
-ab 4 -av 0.10 0.10 0.10 -ds 0.15 -aa 0.15 -ad 512 -ar 128 -as 256 -
dc 0.50  
-dj 0.7  -dp 512 -dr 3 -dt 0.05 -lr 8 -lw 0.002 -sj 1 -st 0.15 

To obtain results for illuminance I execute rcalc for the coordinates 
of the real  measured points using a function I found in the mailing 
archive 

rcalc -e '$1=47.435*$1+119.93*$2+11.635*$3'  

Unfortunatly I don't obtain reasonable results, neither for clear sky 
nor for  overcast conditions. 
The generated values for the outdoor illuminance at clear sky 
conditions are  approximately 25% lower and at overcast 
conditions 40 % higher than in reality. 
The generated values for the outdoor illuminance are converse and 
also  definitive non equivalent in their progression. 

It would be kind if You could help me.

I'm assuming here that you're talking about the glass primitive.
The formula in ray.pdf is formatted in a slightly confusing way.
There's an unambiguous graphic version to be found here:

There is a .cal file in the UNIX distribution (in /src/cal/cal) of 
Radiance that you can use with the calc utility to easily compute these 
values.  You type "calc /path/to/trans.cal" at the comand line, and feed 
it your transmission values (tn), and it spits out a transmissivity value:

% calc trans.cal (or full pathname if not in a PATH location)
tn(.88)
$1=0.958415435
tn(.57)
$2=0.621392084

Just keep on feedin' it values and recording the output, and hit 
control+D to quit when you're done.

Message-ID: <3CEFD5D8-6163-11D7-8C57-00306540F848@lmi.net>

Hello Jorg,

Not knowing anything about your model, it is difficult to say what 
might be the source of your error.  There are so many possibilities, 
it's difficult to even count them.  First off, you should include a 
ground description in your sky description, like so:

skyfunc glow sky_glow
0
0
4 1 1 1  0
sky_glow source sky
0
0
4 0 0 1 180
skyfunc glow ground_glow
0
0
4 1 1 1 0
ground_glow source ground
0
0
4 0 0 -1 180

Or, you could simply increase the coverage of your sky by changing the 
180 to 360.  The result will be the same.  The reason it's important to 
include the ground glow is so that rays outside of your ground plane 
are not counted as black.  I assume your model includes a ground plane 
(a large ring or polygon).  If it does not, and your window is near to 
the ground such that the shadow of the building is important, it can 
make a significant difference to your results.

If you haven't done so already, I strongly recommend you read the 
chapter in "Rendering with Radiance" authored by John Mardaljevic, 
which goes into some detail regarding daylight simulations.  His thesis 
is an even better reference, if you can get a copy.  I didn't see a 
link to it on his website, but there are lots of other useful 
references there:

	http://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm/

I do not have personal experience with the Perez model of gendaylit, 
but I can tell you from the experience I do have that real skies almost 
never match simulated ones.  Unless you start from full angular 
measurements of your sky distribution, you cannot really hope for 
agreements between measurments and simulations of much better than 
+/-25%.  This is not the fault of Radiance or of the options you give 
to the simulation, but simply a "reflection" of the difficulty of 
modeling something as naturally variable as skylight.  Sky distribution 
models are designed to provide a basis for comparison between designs 
under "typical" sky conditions, and are ill-suited to matching specific 
skies or physical measurments.  Try taking the same reading two days in 
a row under what you consider to be an overcast sky.  I wouldn't be 
surprised if the ratio you measure between the outdoor and indoor 
illuminances doesn't vary under different real skies by at least 
10-15%.  You can't ask any simulation to get errors below this 
variation no matter how good it is or how well you have modeled the 
sky.  To match the reality of a particular sky, you must measure it.

I hope this is helpful.

gcc-compiles of Radiance 3.5 on 2.9.x-releases, and now I am using gcc3... 
 
All the rest compiles quite fine. (And I really want to get this new code
onto our 
ultrasparc machines ;-) 
 
CU Lars.

This is a nasty little bit of code that unfortunately is very difficult 
to find a portable solution for.  At the top of rhdisp.c there is a 
macro called "fbufcnt(f)" that is supposed to return the number of 
unread bytes in a FILE f's input buffer.  There is no standard (or even 
conventional) way to do this, so I have a few different hacks in there 
that work on a few different systems.  If this macro isn't operational, 
rholo could lock up in interactive mode.  The way around using such a 
macro would be a lot of really ugly code, which is why I've done like 
this.

The easist solution for solaris is to find the definition of the FILE 
struct, which can be difficult to locate through the typical maze of 
#ifdef's that proliferated since the inception of 3 or more so-called 
"standard" UNIX's.  I usually get the output of the C preprocessor and 
scan it for the FILE struct that is brought in with stdio.h.  I then 
have to make an educated guess as to how the pointers in this struct 
are used, and define the fbufcnt() macro accordingly.  It's a real 
tragedy they never standardized such a function, as it's invaluable for 
operations involving multiple input streams.

Hi Joerg,

I don't wanna discourage you, but you're in for some MAJOR headaches.
Physical validations are a formidable task, to say the least. Errors are
numerous and unavoidable, and you'll have to figure out where they come
from and isolate them. 

We've done a physical validation of the RADIANCE photon map at
Fraunhofer ISE, and I'm still trying to figure out some of the errors in
some instances. We kept everything as simple as possible. Even then,
it's still a nightmare.

We didn't even bother with daylight because of its fluctuations, but
used an artificial source instead. We also gave up using "real" daylight
systems in the measurements after we discovered that most of them have
defects (warping, etc) which vastly affect the light redirection and are
difficult to model. Furthermore, some systems may even give rise to
polarising effects, which cannot be modeled with RADIANCE. In the end,
we resorted to measurements with a simple light shelf.

I assume you're converting irradiance to illuminance here. You can of
course use your measured sky illuminance directly in the simulation
without the need for conversion -- RADIANCE won't care whether it
calculates in watts or lumens. 

Beware that spectral effects can introduce some deviation if you treat
the walls as monochromatic in the simulation. You could roughly estimate
how much the daylight spectrum is modified by wall interreflection
before V(lambda) weighting by the sensors, which I assume is the case in
your setup.

Your validation is also complicated by the wall paint in your office.
Wall paint tends to be off-specular and in some cases even
retroreflective. RADIANCE's gaussian BRDF model will NOT account for
these effects. I suspect the paint's specular component (and no paint is
truly lambertian) contributes significantly to your error.

> Unfortunatly I don't obtain reasonable results

Welcome to the club! :^)

Like I said, you're in for a VERY tough treat here. Life sucks when
comparing SimLife[tm] to RealLife[tm]. Good luck!!!

I obtained a PDF of John's thesis online. Infact, I'm pretty sure it was
available from his website, but maybe that's changed now. Anyway, if
Joerg can't find it, I've got it.

Other than that, I really can't think of any useful validation
references either. My eggs-perience[tm] was that, once you're in
RealLife[tm] territory... you're on your own, mate! There is no compass,
and don't rely on your intuition either. I chucked mine overboard early
on when I embarked on this voyage.

Message-ID: <200303311619.55154.anselmo@dream.unipa.it>

Hi to all!

I finally managed to build two debian packages for Radiance
(1 for binaries + 1 for documentation) and I also converted
them to RPM packages with alien.

The binary packages also include glrad (special=ogl) and 3ds2mgf and
the binaries have been compiled on a Debian 3.0r1 woody
Linux distribution with gcc 2.95.4. 
This is not a static binary distribution
but I'm also planning to make it (in the next days).
I also think I'm going to make a pmap package, so that it can be very easy
to switch between the classic and the pmap radiance binaries.

According to the File System Hierarchy Standard the executables are
copied to /usr/bin, the library files are put inside /usr/share/radiance,
the man files are sent to /usr/share/man and all the documentation 
is saved inside /usr/share/radiance/doc.

The user still has to set the RAYPATH variable, but I'm studying how to
make it automatically through a shell script (next release).

Of course, since this is my very first attempt at making a package, there is
some problems.
The bigger one is this: 
  the "vim" package also has a "rview" executable:
  since the vim package is usually quite important, I decided not to have
  the radiance package conflicting with vim. So, on Debian based system, it is   
  necessary to install the package by issuing the following command:
  # dpkg -i --force-all radiance_3.5.0-1_i386.deb
  in order to overwrite the /usr/bin/rview executable (very bad, isn't it?).
  On different systems it may not be a problem, for instance on my
  linux Mandrake 9.0 box rview from the vim package is put inside /bin/,
  so no overwrite occurs and apparently everything goes smoothly,
  but the system will always execute the vim rview binary, unless
  somebody erases or rename it, or changes the PATH variable.

Could anybody give me some feedback about how to solve this problem
in the best way? I think I'm going to write a message on the debian developer 
mailing list too.

Could we ask to add Radiance to the main or contrib Debian distribution?

The packages are located here:

http://www.dream.unipa.it/dream/pub/dot/anselmo/radiance/packages/

I hope to get your comments/suggestions/infos/flames soon, and I also
hope to have done a useful job.
