Subject: [Radiance-general] Metal Reflection Problem
Message-ID: <BAY2-F120xOASWTgZu6000113a4@hotmail.com>

Dear Group


I have run into an issue with reflections for metal and metal2 materials. In 
my models, I am recieving some noisy reflections. In the following scene, I 
have modeled some kitchen appliances to have a brushed stainless steel 
finish with the following material:

void metal2 brushed_metal_01m1
4	1	1	1	.
0
6 1.0000  1.0000  1.0000  0.75000  0.040 0.075



Here are some renderings of the scene:

http://f1.pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/marcdevon/vwp?.dir=/RadiancePics&.dnm=room2a_camera2.jpg&.view=t

http://f1.pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/marcdevon/vwp?.dir=/RadiancePics&.dnm=room2a_camera5.jpg&.view=t


Here are some of the pertinent render parameters:

-ps 1 -sj 1 -st 0 -dt 0

The pictures were rendered at 1000 x 1000 and filtered to 500 x 500.

I know that there should be some blurry reflections on the surfaces on the 
appliances due to the roughness of the material but I question whether or 
not the reflections should look like fractalized noise. They look far more 
fractalized in their native *.pic format that the *.jpg format that you see 
here. The following is a different scene but with the same appliances and 
associated materials as the previous scene. Instead of being illuminated by 
daylight, it is illuminated by some illumination squares. Here you can see 
the reflections are blurry yet smooth except for the reflection of the 
refridgerator handle on the refridgerator door. Here it seems that we have 
the same fractalized noise phenomenon (I can provide a close up of this to 
show more detail).:

http://f1.pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/marcdevon/vwp?.dir=/RadiancePics&.dnm=room1_default1a.jpg&.view=t

http://f1.pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/marcdevon/vwp?.dir=/RadiancePics&.dnm=room1_default5a.jpg&.view=t

As a side note, the reflections of the light sources on the floor do not 
seem right. I have noticed this before. Does anyone know what's causing 
this?


I have tried to figure out what's causing all of this but I can't get 
anywhere. I should note that all of the previous scenes were rendered with 
Desktop Radiance binaries. I have tested to see if I got similar results 
using Radiance 3.6 binaries using CYGWIN. I have confirmed this to be the 
case. The folling scene is rendered with Radiance 3.6 binaries for CYGWIN:


http://f1.pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/marcdevon/vwp?.dir=/RadiancePics&.dnm=house6a_camera6_filt1.jpg&.view=t




Let me know if anyone has problems viewing these photos.





Thanks


Marcus

Hi Marcus,

try upping -ps. Default for rpict is 4.
You might also wanna reduce -aa, and increase -ar and -ad. There's some 
splotches on the walls, possibly due to caustics from the appliances.

Don't seem right as in no penumbrae? That's expected for a solar source 
modeled with the SOURCE primitive. AFAIK these sources are immune to -dj 
and -ds anyway. Maybe a Fully Licensed Guru[tm] here can tell you more.

Btw, that's a big-ass microwave! :^)

Hello!

I'm using Desktop Radiance 2.0 and I've been making parametric calculations comparing daylight systems -a room with high reflectances, and the same room but adding in one case a lightshelf and in another an anidolic reflector. The room faces south, and I am evaluating them through daylight glare index.

I generated pictures with winrview, both looking into the window and looking sideways, and then used the two main glare routines available (findglare and glarendx). 

According to other studies (including those of people who have used Radiance) the lightshelf should have a lower glare index than the room without any addition, but to my surprise and in the two picture cases, it is the opposite! (absolute illuminance levels are OK, though)

In the beggining I thought that my ceiling was too specular (50%) but then I changed it to another with similar reflectance but no specularity... and the results are still the same!

What could be wrong?

Carlos

Hi Marcus,

in pic room1_default5a you probably miss the reflection of the big 
light-source rectangle on the floor. This is the classical backward ray 
tracing problem, with photon-map things would look differently.

concerning the metal reflections:  high jittering parameters can be 
tricky, a good way to find out what's happening is to start with very 
low settings for both material and rendering params (i.e. almost smooth, 
polished surfaces and the default -dj -dc -dt -sj -st vals) and raise 
them in little steps subsequently to grasp the point when the modelling 
differs from the expectations.

the latter should not be too high, either, many special surface 
properties of custom materials can not be modeled adequately with the 
standard Radiance models. This is understandable as things become really 
difficult when looking at the details. sometimes it helps to add an 
extra normal perturbing texture modifier to the specification, as one 
often has to deal with "roughness structures" which are too big to fit 
into the microscopic roughness models employed by plastic(2)/metal(2) 
materials

Marcus,

I think the "fractal pattern" you refer to in the specular
highlights can be solved by turning on Radiance's pure Monte-
Carlo sampling algorithm (requires re-compiling, though).
I read about it in a text file on the old Radiance site:

----------
RADIANCE Compile Switches

Here is a list of compile switches, used to customize Radiance code for
specific machines and users:

-DMC
    If set, switches from default low-discrepency sequence sampling to
true (pseudorandom) Monte Carlo.  Use if the "brushed" appearance of
specular highlights and penumbras bothers you.
----------

To get this to compile with the HEAD distribution, you need to
make a few changes to the src/common/random.h file. I can give those
to you if you like.

also...

I've found that -dj works with the "source" primitive (again, I
use the HEAD distro, but I found it to work in the 3R5 distro, too).
It uses the last float argument, the angular disc size, to determine
the jittering. Go ahead and raise that from 0.5 to 5 degrees for an
unrealistic sun with nice-looking soft shadows.

I typically use -dj 0.6 to 0.7 for most of my scenes.

BTW: the soft shadows will exhibit the same fractal-like pattern
that you see in the specular highlights. -DMC cures this, too,
but can require higher-resolution runs before filtering down.

Oh, and -ps 1 is almost a necessity with -DMC turned on.

Hello Carlos,

I think it`s difficult to tell what can be the problem without more details.
Maybe the high reflectance in the ceiling is producing glare from the light
bounced by the lightshelf, even without specularity, but this is just a wild
guess. What are the reflectances and specularities of the lightshelf, floor,
walls and ceiling? It will also depend on the geometry of the room. You can
try with more ambient bounces to make sure the walls are getting all the
light they`re supposed to get...

Also, have you tried looking at the images? You can try reading the
luminances in the image and checking the contrast in the two cases. You can
also check the output from findglare, where there are listed all the glare
sources, against the images.
I`m sorry if I cannot be of much help, I`ve used glarendx only a few times.
Hope to be of some help, though.
Good luck and regards,

Santiago.

Hi Marcus,

the necessary changes are some code-exclusions in two Radiance -source 
files of the main distribution.
Probably this has already been changed in the HEAD version (dunno...so 
far I haven't entered the Headshop).

Anyway, I once posted the changes in an answer-mail some months ago:

 http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-May/000702.html

good luck

Marcus,

Hmmm, the changes listed in Carsten's e-mail aren't quite the
same ones that I came up with. They're simpler than mine, and
I'm sure they work, too.

Of course, this may all be moot, as I was able to build today's
HEAD with -DMC invoked without any code changes (except pointing
to /usr/lib/libtiff.a)

Now, if you're building the photon map enhancement, which requires
the 3R5 release, you'll need the changes to get -DMC working.

The changes that I came up with require a few modifications to the
src/common/random.h file:

1) in the "#ifdef  MC" section, add:
extern unsigned short   *urperm;

2) after the next "#else", add:
extern int      initurand(int size);

3) remove, or comment out the following lines:

----------
#ifdef NOPROTO

extern int      initurand();
extern int      ilhash();
extern int      urind();
extern void     multisamp();

#else
                                /* defined in urand.c */
extern int      initurand(int size);
----------

and the final:
----------
#endif
----------

I guess it's kind of long-winded, but it builds on Linux
(Linux 2.4.20-20_29.rh9.at, gcc (GCC) 3.2.2 20030222)

Hi Santiago,
 
Thanks for the reply. To give more details, the room
measures 8x12 meters, with a ceiling height of 2.70 meters.
The window is 8x1.70m (placed on the 8m side).

The materials: ceiling: brushed aluminium (r=80%), walls:
beige (r=65%) and floor: blue (r=20%). These reflectances
were taken from recommendations from literature. 

The light shelf has a length of 1m and is also made from
brushed aluminium and is placed 2.1 meters from the floor.
(half is inside the room and half outside).

I have already tried to include more ambient bounces, but
to no avail. But I will also check the contrast of the
images and check the sources of glare.

I hope this information can be useful!

Carlos

Hi Marcus,

'make' is the tool which builds a new executable from all the source 
files in the ray/src dir, i.e. it organizes the compiling and linking of 
the whole stuff.

The error messages at this stage simply mean that this tool isn't 
installed yet on your system, so you have to install it first.

Message-ID: <BAY2-F80dEl1KP6ETlS00001ac9@hotmail.com>

Dear Group


I have run into an issue with reflections for metal and metal2 materials. In 
my models, I am recieving some noisy reflections. In the following scene, I 
have modeled some kitchen appliances to have a brushed stainless steel 
finish with the following material:

void metal2 brushed_metal_01m1
4	1	1	1	.
0
6 1.0000  1.0000  1.0000  0.75000  0.040 0.075



Here are some renderings of the scene:

http://f1.pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/marcdevon/vwp?.dir=/RadiancePics&.dnm=room2a_camera1.jpg&.view=t
http://f1.pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/marcdevon/vwp?.dir=/RadiancePics&.dnm=room2a_camera2.jpg&.view=t

http://f1.pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/marcdevon/vwp?.dir=/RadiancePics&.dnm=room2a_camera5.jpg&.view=t


Here are some of the pertinent render parameters:

-ps 1 -sj 1 -st 0 -dt 0

The pictures were rendered at 1000 x 1000 and filtered to 500 x 500.

I know that there should be some blurry reflections on the surfaces on the 
appliances due to the roughness of the material but I question whether or 
not the reflections should look like fractalized noise. They look far more 
fractalized in their native *.pic format that the *.jpg format that you see 
here. The following is a different scene but with the same appliances and 
associated materials as the previous scene. Instead of being illuminated by 
daylight, it is illuminated by some illumination squares. Here you can see 
the reflections are blurry yet smooth except for the reflection of the 
refridgerator handle on the refridgerator door. Here it seems that we have 
the same fractalized noise phenomenon (I can provide a close up of this to 
show more detail).:

http://f1.pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/marcdevon/vwp?.dir=/RadiancePics&.dnm=room1_default1a.jpg&.view=t
http://f1.pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/marcdevon/vwp?.dir=/RadiancePics&.dnm=room1_default2a.jpg&.view=t

http://f1.pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/marcdevon/vwp?.dir=/RadiancePics&.dnm=room1_default5a.jpg&.view=t

As a side note, the reflections of the light sources on the floor do not 
seem right. I have noticed this before. Does anyone know what's causing 
this?


I have tried to figure out what's causing all of this but I can't get 
anywhere. I should note that all of the previous scenes were rendered with 
Desktop Radiance binaries. I have tested to see if I got similar results 
using Radiance 3.6 binaries using CYGWIN. I have confirmed this to be the 
case. The folling scene is rendered with Radiance 3.6 binaries for CYGWIN:


http://f1.pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/marcdevon/vwp?.dir=/RadiancePics&.dnm=house6a_camera6_filt1.jpg&.view=t




Let me know if anyone has problems viewing these photos.





Thanks


Marcus

Thanks for the help. I did install the GNU make utility to CYGWIN. I have 
run the makeall script and was able to get some of the binaries to compile 
(51 to be exact), but unfortunately, the remainder I am unsure as to what 
went wrong. I did look for some error messages during the compile and this 
is what I got:

Version.c:1: invalid suffix on floating constant
Version.c:1: parse error before numeric constant
make: *** [Version.o] Error 1
.
.
.

And later on I get the error message:

make: Target `install' not remade because of errors.


Can anyone here provide to me some insight as to what's going on?


Thanks

Hi Marcus,

This discussion probably belongs on the radiance-dev group, not general.

Sounds like Cygwin doesn't work with the current script to make 
Version.c.  Copy the following file to your ray/src/rt directory and 
try recompiling.

Hello all,

I'm still a Radiance noob, and am just
getting my feet under me in using it, and
I understand on a base level the advantages
and abilities of it.

What I'm wondering is how to deal with
things such as landscaping, people, cars,
and other such 'Entourage' items when
producing design visualization renderings
for projects.

I'm concerned that modeling these items
whole, and including them within the
scene, will add too much complexity to
the project and greatly increase
rendering times on large exterior views.

Many 3D programs allow for 'lightweight'
objects to solve this problem. Accurender
auto-generates trees & plants on the fly
fractally, and Max/Viz allows for 'RPC
Content'. However (and please correct
me if I'm wrong) there aren't any
Radiance add-ons to auto-generate
plants and/or allow for RPC content.

Does everyone typically have these
items as whole Radiance models, instanced
into the 'scene'? Is this not a problem
due to Radiance's render engine's differences
from other 3D packages? What about the
repetitiveness apparent in an image when
the same tree/bush/person/car is used
over and over and over again? I see
some exterior renderings on Visarc's
website that have wonderful looking
trees, does anyone know how those
were done?

Thanks,

Jeffrey

Hi Jeffrey,

I have used a tool called Xfrog to generate trees and plants. With Xfrog
you can order different cd's containing sets of pre-modelled trees. I
have translated some of these into OBJ format, and converted them into
Radiance.
The trees are really nice.

Now the good and the bad news:

The good news is that within Radiance I have rendered about 3000 trees
in a scene without troubles ( expect quite long rendering times).

The bad news is that Xfrog - OBJ conversion is not very easy because of
so called "bad vertices" and invalid normals that are generated by
Xfrog, and Radiance does not accept both bad vertices and invalid
normals.
Therefore I edited the 100MB+ obj files virtually by hand ( using search
and replace in vi, a text editor), to remove all errors: very much work!

There is also Bad News II : I did not succed in getting the mapping of
the bark and leaves right.

If there is anyone in this list who can help you (and me!) to make the
conversion between Xfrog-obj files and Radiance smoother, you will have
a very nice tools with Xfrog.

just about repetitiveness:
when you place instance you can also scale, rotate and offset by random
values... using rcalc you can produce coordinates and rotation values to
rcalc again with a file format for instance positioning.
#########################################
an example of the rcalc stuff:
grid 10m x 10m with max offset of 3m and random rotation about obj axis


cnt 10 10 | rcalc -e '$1=10*$1+3*rand($1*$2); $2=10*$2+3*rand($1*$2);
$3=360*rand($1*$2);' | rcalc -o formatfile > radiancefile


######################################################
format file:
void instance tree
7 tree.oct -rz ${$3} -t ${$1} ${$1} 0 
0
0


of course you can use points instead of "cnt 10 10":


rcalc -e '$1=10*$1+3*rand($1*$2); $2=10*$2+3*rand($1*$2);
$3=360*rand($1*$2);' POINTS | rcalc -o formatfile > radiancefile


filr points looks like:
10 20 40
20 30 50
.. .. ..

and rand($1*$2) could be better.....


cheers,
hope it helps

Better than being a Radiance boob, which is what I feel like half the 
time.  =8-)

Radiance can handle the complexity, (i.e. the massive amount of 
polygons), no problem.  What does happen is that the ambient 
calculation gets, as Greg likes to say, "nasty".  Of course, as for 
most limitations in Radiance, the author has developed a tool for 
dealing with that.  You can exclude materials from the ambient 
calculation.  By specifying -ae (material) in your rpict/rtrace command 
(or by placing it in your .rif file (render= -ae [material]) you tell 
Radiance to apply the ambient (-av) value to all materials on the -ae 
line, thus skipping a whole lot of interreflection calculations.

Generally, yes, these complex "library" items are instanced.  This 
saves lots of memory.  I have also read about people who write scripts 
that randomize the placement of these library items.  By varying the 
tree instances over three or four distinct models, and further varying 
the scale & rotation of each instanced tree, you can create a very 
random look to your "forest", for example.  AFAIK, the trees you see in 
Visarc's renderings are all 3D geometry.  They pride themselves on 
creating everything and faking nothing.  Amazing, yeah?

Hi all,

Hopefully this is a simple question:

Is it possible to get the focal length of a camera view from within
Radiance?

I know that the view angle specification makes this unnecessary as an
input parameter but was wondering if it is possible to reconstruct the
physical camera properties from only a Radiance view description.

Cheers

Rich

(Hoping to have a decent animation and the Maya2Rad tools online
soon.promises, promises ;-))

Hi,

I'm currently using Radiance compiled to run under Windows Services for Unix
(Interix) and am attempting to upgrade from my current version (3.1) to the
latest version (3.5).  I have managed to get 3.5 to compile without any
errors (except for trad and rholo, which I'm not too worried about right
now), however I am experiencing problems when using rpict.  The other
components (rtrace, rview, etc) seem to be working correctly (or at least
producing results similar to my previous installation) however the images
produced rpict are looking very strange (and very different to rview).  

It is kind of hard to describe the results I am getting in plain text, but
if for example I use rpict to produce a fisheye view of a CIE overcast sky
then it produces a luminance pattern that starts off from the horizon
getting brighter as it heads towards the zenith before suddenly dropping to
zero about a third of the way up from where it increases again until about
2/3rds up where it drops to zero again, so the luminance distribution from
horizon to zenith looks something like a saw tooth (rather than smoothly
increasing from horizon to zenith as it should).  I get a similar effect
across surfaces when I render more complex scenes.  The same scene with the
same settings works on the older version of rpict.  The effect is as if a
variable somewhere is increasing beyond its maximum range and wrapping back
around to zero.

I'd be very grateful for any help as to what the problem might be (and how I
can fix it).  Perhaps there is some compiler switch that I need to set?

Kind regards,

Andy Stone

What I thought would be a straightforward night-time scene has turned
out not to be. The first two images at the link below shows a
conventional scene with the lights replmarks-ed in. All the lights are
based the same fitting, a Thorn Contrast C (33000lm).=20

w
=3Dt


After doing a few test renders with just one light, a wall and a ground
plane I realized the splotchy areas beyond the site where the result of
the ambient calculation picking up the bright wall areas just below the
fittings. No extra ab's, ad's ,as's, extra ar or setting aa to 0 solved
the problem. The lamp is modeled as a 10mm sphere therefore source
sub-structuring didn't seem to be the issue either.=20

This suggested to me using mkillum to eliminate the gamble of the first
ambient bounce finding the bright surfaces: feed the brightest surfaces
to mkillum while retaining the original surface modifiers for the final
render. This involved switching to AutoCAD to 'radout' the polygons
(previously I was using .obj files), a degree of re-modelling , checking
the surface normals and splitting the model in two. The result (third
image: 'AlternativeA_pcond') is still less than satisfactory.

I experimented putting a void illum polygon a few millimeters in front
of the wall. A single bright splotch still appeared. There also seemed
to be a slightly different light distribution, which made me question
using opaque surfaces as illum sources.

An illum 'fence' could be spaced a distance from each building to try
and catch the splotches before they appear, but I haven't tried that
yet.

I am interested primarily in the final appearance of the image. The
illuminance beyond the site boundary is quite low - below 3 lux.=20

Does anyone have any suggestions?=20

Hi Andy,

Are you compiling from the official 3.5 release, or the latest HEAD 
(available from radiance-online)?  If you are compiling from the 
official release, the first thing to try (always) is downloading and 
compiling the HEAD release, which has quite a few bug fixes, especially 
related to portability across platforms.

If you do this and are still seeing errors, then I suggest you post a 
message to the radiance-dev list, since it will then be a development 
issue once we are working on the latest sources.  It is not worthwhile 
for anyone to attempt to debug the official release at this stage, as 
they are 90% likely to be rediscovering bugs that have already been 
found and fixed.

Thanks for your efforts -- hopefully, this won't take long.

-Greg

P.S.  Be sure to overlay the rad3R5supp.tar.gz files over the HEAD 
release prior to compiling, as without these additional files, you 
won't have a complete distribution.

Message-ID: <9CAAC0A4-152F-11D8-9FFF-000A956D40C8@lmi.net>

Hi Rich,

Marcus Jacobs asked a similar question about focal lengths last month 
on this group (Oct. 19th, in fact).

For a 35mm frame (which measures 36x24mm on the actual exposure), the 
equation for the horizontal and vertical view angles (in degrees) is:

	h = 2*180/PI*atan(36/2/f)
	v = 2*180/PI*atan(24/2/f)

To derive the focal length from the view angle, you just invert these:

	f = 36/2/tan(PI/180/2*h)
	f = 24/2/tan(PI/180/2*v)

As you can see, there are two formulas above, which means that you can 
derive the focal length from either the horizontal or the vertical view 
angles, but they won't necessarily agree.  This is obvious because any 
given Radiance view may not have the correct image aspect ratio to 
match 35mm (or any other format) film.  You have what is known in math 
as an "overdetermined problem."  You can choose to ignore this and 
simply average the results from these two formulas, or pick the larger 
or smaller of the two, depending on whether you wanted to fill the 
frame completely or keep the image with black borders (i.e., 
"letterbox" format).

Hi Bruce,

Interesting problem.  I presume that you don't see this unless you run 
the image through pcond, which makes the darker areas visible.  Did you 
try applying the -h option of pcond?  This might reduce the appearance 
of these splotches considerably.

Getting at the heart of your errors, they are really due to the 
low-angle light coming in from the horizon on the outer perimiter of 
your model.  Your idea of placing a "mkillum fence" around the 
perimiter is a good one, and might well eliminate these splotches.  
Make your polygons out of "void" and completely surround your building 
with a fence as high as the top of the roof.  You might get another 
artifact from this, though, which will be the unexpected appearance of 
a bright line right near the mkillum fence, even though the fence 
itself will be otherwise invisible.  I'm not sure how to avoid this.

Do you really want to see the spill light on the surroundings?  
Typically, moonlight would drown this out.  If you added a moon, you 
might not even notice your splotches anymore.  You could also exclude 
the surrounding material using the -ae option.  You won't get the spill 
light anymore, but the splotches would be gone with it.

-Greg

Actually, the focal length is determined by the largest
dimension of the picture, the diagonal, which makes it
somewhat independent of the aspect ratio.
The normally used formula for 35mm film pictures
therefore goes like this:

  f = 43.27/2/tan(PI/180/2*h)

Gidday Bruce,

Ok this is bit of a punt - and hopefully it won't end up looking like a  
dog's breakfast.

if you don't mind flat shading of the surrounding surfaces and loosing  
the light spill you could treat them as glow surfaces (with low RGBs to  
produce something equivalent to the slightly darker areas of the land  
or sea) and set the 4th parameter maxrad -ve so they don't contribute  
to scene illumination.

Effectively it should be a way of killing off the ambient calculation  
in those areas while still producing at least the presence of a  
coloured surface. Vertical surfaces might need their own lower glow  
definition to make a contrast.

The abstractness might help indicate the 'extent' of the lighting  
rendering, but if the flatness of the shading ends up being an  
aesthetic problem, then a Brightfunc could be written to modify the  
glows and slowly fade them out with distance from the project.

hope this helps
cheers
alex

hallo to u all!!!
im a graduate student dealing with agricultural eng. and i found radiance
very usefull in determining optimal tree prunning.
my problem is such. i found from field experiments extinction of light into
the canopy (avocado in my case) and i was told using the "mist" material i
could model it on radiance.
does any one have experince or know how to turn an extinction formula
 ( i.e. I=Io*exp(-0.5x)    x being the distance) into mist parameters?

thx

Hi Matan,

The first three arguments to the "mist" material type are the extension 
coefficients with respect to distance.  In other words, you can plug 
these values into a mist volume directly, like so:

void mist avocado_canopy_mist
0
0
3 .5 .5 .5

!genbox avocado_canopy_mist avocado_canopy 50 50 6 | xform -t 0 0 10

The above would place a 10-meter thick canopy that is 50x50 into your 
scene.  I have no idea what you actually want, but hopefully this will 
set you in the right direction.  If you want to see light scattered 
from this canopy, you need to add the names of the sources as string 
arguments to the mist material.  See the Radiance reference manual for 
details:

Hi Matan,

You're using RADIANCE to model *avocados*? Now that's resourceful!
I'll bet a lotta fellas around here would rather model veggies and fruit 
than some bloody big buildings... :^)

> does any one have experince or know how to turn an extinction formula
>  ( i.e. I=Io*exp(-0.5x)    x being the distance) into mist parameters?

In this case 0.5 would correspond to the coefficient of extinction 
specified with the MIST primitive or with the -me option.

See ya!

Holle,my name is kouichi in Japanese !
I'm using Rad for win with Autocad.


I have some questions.

Firstly,when I make  non-luminous material  like a plastic, I  use 
xyz_rgb.cal with reflectance(Y) and chromaticity(x y)  mesured by 
reflectance meter. Is this OK ?

And secondly, For luminous material  like a light, if uncolored , I use { 
Radiance =luminance/179} and {Radiance= Rr = Rb = Rg}.
But if colored materials ,I want to use  xyz_rgb.cal with luminance and 
chromaticity(x y)  mesured by luminance meter.In this cace , Y=luminance?
In page 310 of Rendering with Radiance (5.1.14) ;

If our device mesure an xyY value of (.424 .399 63 ), these cordinates can 
be converted to RGB using xyz_rag.cal:
% rcalc -f xyz_rgb.cal  -e 'ix=$1;iy=$2;iY=$3'  -f xyz_rgb.cal \
-e 'iX=ix/iy*iY;iZ=(1-ix-iy)/iy*iY'  \
-e '$1=R(iX,iY,iZ) ; $2=G(iX,iY,Z) ; $3=B(iX,iY,iZ)'
.424 .399 63

and output is  ( 87.0934196  57.4293016  22.034743 ).

And in p311;

void light halogen_light
0
0
3  87.0934196  57.4293016  22.034743



I have thought  Y=luminance.But 63(cd/m2) is too small for halogen light.
And using {.265r +.655b+ .082b} with three radiance value for 
halogen_light, output is 63.
Is 63 Radiance(=luminance/179)??

Supposing it meets, I can understand.

Thanks a lot.

Hello Kouichi,

It appears that page 310 (sect. 5.1.14) does contain an error because 
it does not convert luminance (in cd/m^2) to radiance (in watts/sr/m^2) 
using the 1/179 factor.  The formulas in the previous section (5.1.13) 
are correct, but the next section neglects the 179 lumens/watt scaling. 
  We apologize for this oversight.

Regarding the best way to get correct colors, I strongly encourage you 
to read the paper I coauthored at last year's Eurographics Workshop on 
Rendering, which you can find here:

	http://www.anyhere.com/gward/papers/egwr02/

This explains how you really want to convolve the source spectrum with 
the surface reflectance spectra and white balance the results.  Without 
such a technique, you are better off simply using white light sources, 
even when you know they are not truly white.

I hope this helps.
-Greg

Hi,

the trick is to use (frozen) octrees as instances and exclude these 
objects from the ambient calculation. Usually you don't need their 
ambient contribution. I did this with urban design models and LOTS OF 
trees (go to www.3dcafe.com ;-)

Ok, I am sure that you have been told about that. I would like to add 
that the easy way to do is to use markers in your cad-model. You place 
triangles on one layer per object-type (e.g. one layer car_ferrari, one 
layer tree_oak, ...). After you converted from cad to rad, you can use 
radiance to replace the markers with instances. That's the nicest way 
to place objects I know about - just click the triangles in your CAD 
where the objects are to appear later.

If you really want to do everything the gui-way... Georg Mischler's 
rayfront (www.schorsch.com) handles the triangle-marker replacement.

CU and good luck, Lars.

Hi there!

I'm using DR 2.0 and I've been making parametric
calculations comparing daylight systems -a room with high
reflectances, and the same room but adding in one case a
lightshelf and in another an anidolic reflector. The room
faces south, and I am evaluating them through daylight
glare index (dgi).

To give more details, the room measures 8x12 meters, with a
ceiling height of 2.70 meters. The window is 8x1.70m
(placed on the 8m side).

The materials: ceiling: brushed aluminium (r=80%), walls:
beige (r=65%) and floor: blue (r=20%). These reflectances
were taken from recommendations from literature. 

The light shelf has a length of 1m and is also made from
brushed aluminium and is placed 2.1 meters from the floor.
(half is inside the room and half outside).

I generated pictures with winrview, both looking into the
window and looking sideways, and then used the two main
glare routines available (findglare and glarendx). 

According to other studies (including those of people who
have used Radiance) the lightshelf should have a lower
glare index than the room without any addition, but to my
surprise and in the two picture cases, it is the opposite!
(absolute illuminance levels are OK, though)

In the beggining I thought that my ceiling was too specular
(50%) but then I changed it to another with similar
reflectance but no specularity... and the results are still
the same!

What could be wrong?

Carlos

Hi Carlos,

Glare calculations are quite tricky, because they are sensitive to the 
exact view you choose to calculate them, and there are a number of 
choices for glare indices as well, none of them terribly well-suited to 
daylight.  (Not in glarendx, at least.)

It is impossible to determine anything from your description of your 
situation.  Are you giving fisheye views to findglare?  What do these 
images look like?  Are you giving findglare an octree so that it may 
call rtrace?

And for the group, has anyone determined that findglare works correctly 
in Desktop Radiance?

Hi Greg,

The pictures were generated using the fish-eye view, they
are looking from the middle of one of the long walls of the
room to the other (the expected position of the user). So I
have the window on one side of the picture and the bottom
of the room on the other.

I give the findglare both the octree and the picture name,
but I get the same results just as if specifying only the
picture. By the way, just giving findglare the octree and
direction of the view gives an error message in DR 2.0. I
have also increased the number of ambient bounces, but it
doesn't change, either.

Carlos

Yup!  You'll want to run, don't walk, to this website:

AFAIK, this is no longer being actively developed, but the program's

Now I have another problem.

I$B!G(Bd like to make sky dome that material depend on sky distribution

Then I made it by using square*145 by $B!H(Bpolygon$B!I(B. I know this way give sky

When the radius of sky dome was changed so that indoor (1.5m * 1.2*1.3m)

actual measurement was acquired in the radius of 200m.But rendered picture

just about rendering quality,

I suggest you to use "light" instead "glow", 
consider window with mkillum (generate light distribution for windows pol.),
use them like emitters without the sky.... 
(or with a fake overcast/intermediate or clear sky outside, just for

PS about radii dimension you should take into account parallax errors (two
points in your model, both looking north, and intersecting in different
places the sky dome: less this angle, better it is...)

Hello, Radiance-general.


For making material, $B!F!G(JPicture Perfect RGB Rendering Using Prefiltering

Now I have another problem.

I$B!G(Jd like to make sky dome that material depend on sky distribution 
measured 145 points. These 145 points relate to CIE IDMP. I think the best 
way is to make it by using $B!H(Jbrightfunc$B!I(J and $B!H(Jsource$B!I(J which has o 
distance. But this is very difficult way for me. 
Then I made it by using square*145 by $B!H(Jpolygon$B!I(J. I know this way give sky 
distance. Maybe distance between room and sky is important. 

When the radius of sky dome was changed so that indoor (1.5m * 1.2*1.3m) 
illuminance by rtrace might become suitable, the almost same value as an 
actual measurement was acquired in the radius of 200m.But rendered picture

Thanks for the plug, Rob! :^)

Yep, someone finally hit the nail on the head there. Lightpipes are a 
showcase application for forward raytracing, as you'll see on the 
webpage. Check out the lightpipe scene in the egg samples; that should 
get you started. Lemme know how the addon works for you.

See ya!

Hello Kouichi,

I think the best way is using Brightdata or Colordata. I know these take a
data file as input, but I`ve never tried them myself.

another problem is the value measured at sun`s position. As I understood
your method, you`d be modeling the sun with a polygon of greater area than
the real sun, but with the same luminance, which will produce excessive
illuminance. One solution could be to use an average value over the surface
(difficult to calculate) so you`d get correct illuminance but wrong
luminances... or am I missing something? Probably someone with more
experience can correct me here.

Message-ID: <sfbb330b.050@arup.com.au>

Hi Carlos,

Are you predicting glare using the DGI?  if you are, there may be some errors produced by potential glare sources behind the field of view.

findglare identifies potential glare sources.  then glarendx -t dgi takes these sources and calculates glare indices in a range of directions.  take a look at the predicted dgi's at adjacent directions.  if there is an obvious jump in dgi between adjacent directions, then you probably have a glare source behind the field of view.  To fix, simply remove the offending glare source from the file output by findglare, and re-run glarendx -t dgi.  if that doesn't make any sense, let me know and i'll send you a spreadsheet i developed to identify problematic glare sources.

For Greg, or whoever else might be interested, the problem is in the calculation of dgi's omega in glarendx.c.  where the glare source is behind the field of view, posindex returns -1, p becomes 0 and omega is much bigger than adjacent levels.  this means the glare source is artificially inflated, and the glare index jumps up.

Phil.

Hi Greg,

The pictures were generated using the fish-eye view, they
are looking from the middle of one of the long walls of the
room to the other (the expected position of the user). So I
have the window on one side of the picture and the bottom
of the room on the other.

I give the findglare both the octree and the picture name,
but I get the same results just as if specifying only the
picture. By the way, just giving findglare the octree and
direction of the view gives an error message in DR 2.0. I
have also increased the number of ambient bounces, but it
doesn't change, either.

Carlos

Hi Carlos,

Unfortunately, I don't have a lot of time to play around with this 
right now.  It looks on first glance that your ceiling is highly 
specular -- is it made of metal?  I can't understand these sorts of 
reflections off any standard painted surface.

As for the bug in glarendx, I have fixed it for tomorrow's HEAD, but I 
don't think this is your problem as you only use a 180 degree field of 
view in your fisheye image, leaving findglare unable to fully 
characterize the window.  I would think it better if you increased your 
field of view.  Also, I'm not sure that the various glare index 
calculations are stable for sources that are at right angles to the 
view direction.  I recommend that you use the -ga option to findglare 
to generate vertical illuminances at several angles, then use these in 
glarendx to get a function of glare with respect to view direction.  
This way, you'll be able to see how sensitive the calculation is to 
viewing direction.  It will only work with a wider view, however, so 
you will need to use the view type -vta rather than -vth.

Hi,
I'm trying to install Radiance on Red Hat Linux. However, I can't get the 
installation process successfully completed. I start with
./makeall install
as described on the README file.
After answering the following questions:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RADIANCE 3.5 INSTALLATION

This script rebuilds all of the Radiance programs and installs
them on your system.  You should read the file README before running
this script.  You can type ^C (followed by return) at any time to abort.

You must first answer the following questions.

What is your preferred editor [vi]?
Where do you want the executables [/usr/local/bin]?
Current rmake command is:
#!/bin/sh
exec make "SPECIAL=" \
         "OPT=-O2 -DSPEED=200" \
         "MACH=-Dlinux -L/usr/X11R6/lib -I/usr/include/X11 -DNOSTEREO 
-DBIGMEM" \
         ARCH=IBMPC "COMPAT=bmalloc.o erf.o getpagesize.o" \
         INSTDIR=/usr/local/bin \
         LIBDIR=/usr/local/lib/ray \
         CC=gcc "$@" -f Rmakefile
Do you want to change it?n
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

... the installation continues, but it stops at the following:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
gcc -O2 -DSPEED=200 -Dlinux -L/usr/X11R6/lib -I/usr/include/X11 -DNOSTEREO
-DBIGMEM -DBIGGERLIB -I../common -L../lib -o histo histo.o -lm
make: Target `install' not remade because of errors.
set nonomatch; rm -f *.o calc ev rcalc total cnt neat lam tabfunc histo
~/linday/ray/src
There were some errors.
Removing library archives...
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Can you give some quick inputs on what I'm doing wrong?

Thanks,
Alex

We'd be happy to help you, but we'll need a more complete copy
of the build log. When it says "There were some errors." that means
that you should look back in the log for "Error" and report
that or those entries.

What would also be helpful is to know which version of Radiance
you are trying to compile: 3R5, or 3.6a (HEAD)?

Thanks!

Mark,
I appreciate your help.
I'm installing version 3.5 available at the Radiance Download site.
In attachment is what I could save from the log file.

That's kinda what I figured you'd see.  It looks like you don't have the 
development tools installed, so the X11 libraries are missing.  is this 
your personal PC, or something in a school's lab?  You said you're using 
RHL8, yeah?  I use that here, and I installed all the development stuff, 
and the Radiance HEAD release compiled just fine.  So, all you need to 
do is add in the dev stuff, or get the school's admin to do it in the 
case of a school computer, and try again.

Good luck!  If you have any more trouble, report back here.

Hi Alexandre,

Why are you compiling the official release under Linux, anyway?  Just 
download the binaries if that's what you want.  If you want the latest, 
download the HEAD release (and overlay) and compile that.  You will 
need the dev tools, though, to do it.

Subject: [Radiance-general] radmap
Message-ID: <200311192217.19249.pisuke@libero.it>

Hi all!

I've finally released radmap, a Radiance
based command line tool to get irradiation maps
[kWh/m^2 or MJ/m^2], that can be useful for solar
systems design, and illumination maps [lux hours],
that are interesting for daylighting applications.

It is available at the following address:

http://www.dream.unipa.it/dream/pub/dot/anselmo/radiance/05.php

I've only written a short man page to document it; I hope
to have more time to put together a more extensive guide ...

There is an example package, too. You can use it to make
your first tests.

I hope that you download and try it, report bugs and send
suggestions about how to improve it.

Hi All,

How do people feel about information relating to 3D modeling job 
opportunities on this list? Can I provide some basic description and 
contact information to the group? The work would not be directly related 
to the main interest of this group and does not relate to my company. 
This is for a friend of mine. Comments (preferences from the senior 
people, Peter, Greg....)?

Thanks,

-Jack

PS: I will not be offended if the consensus is no.

Message-ID: <A610A23A-1CC8-11D8-8635-000A958AD820@psu.edu>

Hi everyone,
   I am a new Radiance user, currently a student at Penn State, 
currently trying to get Radiance up and running on my mac running os 
10.3

   I don't know exactly what to do in order to set the RAYPATH 
environment variable so that my system knows to look for the radiance 
files in /usr/local/bin

   Could someone put together a beginner level unix user step by step 
list of how this is done. I can't wait to get this working! Thanks.

... at 3:48 AM?  There are so many other things to do at that hour!  
(of course, I don't seem to be doing much better here).

If you're using Panther, your default shell is bash.  The way you add 
environment variables is to add them to your .bash_profile file.  This 
is like the autoexec.bat on a windows system.  Note the period (dot) 
prefix on the filename.  The dot makes it a hidden file, which won't 
show up when you do a directory listing.  To see if you already have 
one, you do "ls -a", which lists the hidden files too.

Anyway, from your home directory, type:

pico .bash_profile

You should now be in a text editor displaying the contents of your 
.bash_profile file, or a blank file if it didn't exist already.  You 
want to add the following lines:

PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
RAYPATH=.:/usr/local/lib/ray
export PATH RAYPATH

What that does, line by line:

1) "make my PATH equal to /usr/local/bin, and whatever else was already 
in the PATH."

2) "make RAYPATH equal to the current directory (.) and 
/usr/local/lib/ray."

3) "save those requests; so that they exist every time I start a 
terminal session."

That's something I've been wanting to do for a while.  For now, use 
this list as a resource, and you'll be up and running soon enough.  
Follow the steps above, and let us know if you still have problemos.

Hi Phillip,
 
Thanks for the email about glare, I tried to identify the glare source as you said, but I think if you send the spreadsheet you mentioned could be very useful!
 
Many thanks,

findglare identifies potential glare sources. then glarendx -t dgi takes these sources and calculates glare indices in a range of directions. take a look at the predicted dgi's at adjacent directions. if there is an obvious jump in dgi between adjacent directions, then you probably have a glare source behind the field of view.

For Greg, or whoever else might be interested, the problem is in the calculation of dgi's omega in glarendx.c. where the glare source is behind the field of view, posindex returns -1, p becomes 0 and omega is much bigger than adjacent levels. this means the glare source is artificially inflated, and the glare index jumps up.

Hi Greg,

The pictures were generated using the fish-eye view, they
are looking from the middle of one of the long walls of the
room to the other (the expected position of the user). So I
have the window on one side of the picture and the bottom
of the room on the other.

I give the findglare both the octree and the picture name,
but I get the same results just as if specifying only the
picture. By the way, just giving findglare the octree and
direction of the view gives an error message in DR 2.0. I
have also increased the number of ambient bounces, but it
doesn't change, either.

Hi all,
As promised, I am posting the last results I got with image based lighting,
especially about illuminance values under a mapped sky. All the explanation
is a bit too long to write it here, so I`ve put it in a page for those who
are interested. The address is:

http://home.att.ne.jp/banana/tiago/radiance/IBL.htm

I`m not sure if the explanation is clear enough, so please ask me if it`s
not.
Next, I`ll be trying to include the sun in the simulations, so I hope to
have more news in the future about this.
Regards,

Santiago.

Hi Santiago,

Thanks for taking the time to write that up.  I need more coffee this 
morning before I fully digest all the numbers there, but one statement 
at the end bears comment:

"One thing to consider is that the camera has a built-in bracketing 
option that can take up to 5 images, with up to 1 stop increments. If 
the scene has high contrast, this can be insufficient to capture the 
whole range, so manual set up might be needed."

I'm actually looking to buy a new camera for the office so that we can 
use HDR photography for survey work, mostly lower contrast stuff.  But 
I'm wondering, what is the contrast threshold where you would need to go 
manual?  I'm looking at the Canon digital rebel, which only does the 
three shot autobracket but can separate each exposure by two stops. 
Greg Ward & I discussed this off-list and he said that that is 
sufficient for what I'm looking to do.  But I assume you're talking 
about much higher contrast scenes, such as landscapes with direct sun, 
that would require a manual exposure?

I have done this for installing Radiance on Cygwin under Windows 2K
& for Mandrake Linux. More because I wanted to remember how I got
them working, so once I did, I wrote out a little how-to.

And I don't know about OS X; but will be jumping ship to it within
next year (gonna buy my friend's used G4 when he gets his G5). But
one thing that's a pain when installing Radiance, and a major point
of my confusion when I first started using it, is that the command
'rview' is already used on some systems to call upon the VI editor,
rather than the Radiance command. Once you've got the raypath and
such set, type 'rview' and see what happens. If it opens Vi, or Vim,
then you've got to go in and remove the symbolic links named Rview
that are the cause of this behavor or set your pathing different,
otherwise you won't be able to use Radiance at all.

This was true in both the full install of Cygwin & Mandrake. So
since 10.3 also uses the Bash shell, it could be possible that
it's the same for 10.3 as well. Just a word of warning.

Also O'rilley has a wonderful 'Unix for Mac' kinda book, where
it teaches you how to use your Mac's command line. A large
part of using Radiance effectively is in understanding how
to use the Unix command line effectively, they go hand-in-hand,
so unless you already know a lot about it I'd recommend that
you get a book on it so you don't learn everything the hard
way like I did, and be a pest to others as I was. :)

Is this accessible online someplace?

You will like it.  Your friend will like his G5 even more, it seems.

Ack!  you're right, and I had meant to post something about that months 
ago when I (re)discovered that.  I originally came across that problem 
way back in 1996, when I first installed & compiled Radiance on an old 
PII/266.  I thought - get this - that something went wrong during the 
compile, and that was why vi was loading instead of rview, that somehow 
the compile process grabbed bits of vi's source when compiling Radiance. 
  What the hell did (do) I know?  It was but one of many false starts in 
my Radiance explorations.

It's got nothing to do with the shell, the problem is that if you blow 
off the default location and install the Radiance binaries someplace 
other than /usr/local/bin, even if you place your new location on the 
RAYPATH & PATH, it's likely to be lower in priority than the location of 
the symbolic link to vim that seems to be present on a LOT of the 
current Linux distros.

Kudos for pointing that out to the list, Jeffrey.  I guess most people 
just accept the default location for the Radiance binaries so they never 
see this problem.  Do a "locate rview" on your systems though; lots of 
you will probably see a link in /bin, linking rview to vi...

Greg, maybe a little warning could be added to the install script?

I've never actually used the photon map module, so I can't give any 
specifics on installing it.  However, Francesco Anselmo has created a 
bunch of pre-made packages for radiance, including one that uses the 
photon map.  Head on over to:

http://www.dream.unipa.it/dream/pub/dot/anselmo/radiance/02.php

... for details.  They are based on the official release, but if you 
wanna get started with the photon map and are new to installing & 
compiling and LINUXing in general, these may be a good way to get your 
feet wet.  Good luck!

Patching is no longer necessary with the current pmap release -- you 
just dump the files into the RADIANCE source tree, clobbering those 
which were modified as well as adding some new ones. As far as I can 
tell, Anselmo's pmap binaries are based on an old release. Since you'll 
have to recompile the whole suite anyway, you might as well omit step 2 
above. Note that RADIANCE modified with pmap behaves exactly like 
RADIANCE Classic unless you explicitly use pmap options. As such, you 
don't need the original RADIANCE binaries anyway.

Good luck!

Hi Rob,

My camera takes 5 exposures, from +2 to -2, so the result would be the same
only with fewer pictures (which can be an advantage) The problem is that the
mid exposure is calculated from the whole scene light. Additionally, you can
set the under/over-exposure option to offset all the bracketing (in my
camera up to 2 stops), so you can get for example from 0 to +/-5.

Still I found situations where this was not enough. Not only daylight,
direct sun and so on, but even in a relatively dark room with only one
bright lamp, the lamp can be out of range. I use the colormeter in osx to
make sure that the brightest zones are below 255 in the darkest picture, and
the darkest above 0 in the brightest. This can be really bad if for instance
you had gone to a remote place to take some images and then back at home you
find out that they`re no good... (I know why I`m saying this)

The best thing would be to test the camera`s latitude (the difference in
f-stops between the minimum and maximum registerable values) so you can
meter the exposure in the highlights and shadows and find out if
auto-bracketing is enough.
Hope this helps. All this is not so complicated, but it`s tricky to explain
in writing (at least for me)
Regards,

Santiago.

Dear all,

we have brought up a web server which allows you to create HDR images 
on-line. The engine under the bonnet is Greg's hdrgen (thanks Greg!). 
You may upload up to 9 JPEG images, totalling 5MB. The results you get 
back are a RADIANCE image and a false colour JPEG.

For now, you can only hit it with the default option. No command-line 
switches are implemented yet. When the future of hdrgen becomes clear, 
we will implement more sophisticated control over the HDR generation.

It's an old K6-II 500 box, so be patient.

There are also some web pages to go with it giving some theory of HDR 
and a list of software and cameras that are suitable. Please email me 
with the details of your camera (bracketing, exposure correction etc.), 
so we build up a repository of information.

We'd be grateful for any other feedback, too

Cheers

Axel

Hi *!

For people who's interested, I've released
a bugfix version of radmap (0.1b).
There was a bug in the class that calculates solar
angles for EPW weather data input.

URL:
http://www.dream.unipa.it/dream/pub/dot/anselmo/radiance/05.php

The window$ binary version is not yet available,
but will be soon ...

Uhm... no. Guess not. I thought I had posted it to this
Revit support site where I was talking about Radiance,
but I guess I didn't. Is there a good spot for me to
post it? I don't currently have one.

It's a minor pain. The biggest problem I see with it isn't that
fact that rview is named the same as the alias used for Vim, it's
the fact that people, like me, install cygwin or linux specifically
for learning Radiance, run into this problem, and not understanding
anything about unix are instantly lost. :)

But then it's kinda like when my dad threw me into the deep end
to force me to learn to swim. :)

But this rview problem is there in Mandrake, and in Cygwin
too if you install Vim. For Mandrake, I simply removed the
alias with no problems, and for Cygwin I simply uninstalled
Vim, for I use Emacs. :)

Right. Didn't mean to imply that it was Bash, meant that since
they are now using Bash in 10.3, there are other things that they
are probably doing that are closer to linux distros. I don't remember
this rview problem happening on my wife's G4, which is running 10.2,
and where I put the files in the default location.

> Kudos for pointing that out to the list, Jeffrey.

No problem. It was just my first big hurtle in learning radiance
and/or the *nix command line, so I thought I'd talk about it to
help others in my position.

I don't know quite what to do about this, other than to suggest that 
people put the Radiance binary directory at the front of their 
executable search path.  I have added a note to the end of the makeall 
script reminding users how to do this.

Message-ID: <7300B8B9B92D1441910052FEC7D9F754053CAC@aries.burohappold.com>

We are running a .oct through rpiece and we get the 'resolution mismatch in
rpict' error.  We have removed -x and -y settings from the .vf files.  We
have set the horizontal and vertical angles at 80 degrees and 80 degrees.
Our .opt file sets -x and -y at 2048 and 2048.  The only other thought we

files which have been created using different -r settings in oconv.

Any help appreciated.

Well, probably the best place for it is radiance-online.org.  If there's 
no place for it there, I'd be happy to post it on my website. My search 
engine is nonexistent at the moment, but after a few days Google would 
index the page and maybe some wayward sould looking for help with 
installing radiance would stumble upon your howto on my website.  Let me 
know.

Hi Andrew,

This error sounds suspiciously like a communication problem between 
rpiece and rpict, since the resolution string is the first thing rpiece 
tries to read back from rpict.  I'm sure it doesn't have anything to do 
with the octree or the -x and -y options or where they appear.  Does 
rpiece die right away, or only after it's done some work?  What 
machine(s) are you running on?  Rpiece talks to its rpict process over 
a standard Unix pipe/socket, which should be reliable.  I'm quite 
puzzled by this error -- has anyone else on the list gotten this before?

Hi Andrew and Greg,

We have encountered this before. Although at the moment I am not sure 
that I can think of the cause(s). Here are some things to look at:

    * are you using a persist file (-PP) -  if it is left over some
      reason from something else then this can cause problems
    * is there an rpict process hanging around - this is also going to
      be associated with -PP, this can occur if a rpiece job dies
      unexpectedly or is killed and not cleaned up, clean up may need to
      occur by hand
    * are you using rpiece on something that runs really really fast - I
      have noticed that if your run rpiece on a scene that runs super
      fast or on a very small image that runs very fast  then things can
      get confused and die which I believe results in this kind of error
      as well.

If you can send further diagnostic information then it may help jar my 
memory further on the topic.

previsualization for movie productions. He is interested in putting

UK and possibly elsewhere in Europe. He would be interested in talking 
with people who have experience with Maya and/or Softimage. Preferably 
with 3D modeling experience with either of these tools and ideally with

Yeah, I ran into that too with Mandrake, and it pissed me off! I 
immediately obliterated the damn alias and vi(m) with it. It ranks down 
there in my bottom 10 braindead editors of all time (DOS edlin also 
comes to mind). I've always preferred joe; it's compact and powerful 
enuff for my purposes. I can't imagine for the life of me why anybody'd 
call vi their editor of choice, but I know for a fact some individuals 
at Fraunhofer ISE swear by it.

Sorry for the off-topic stuff, hope that won't start an editor feud. But 
since we're on about editors: emacs sucks. :^)

This problem has existed for far too long. The simple and intelligent
fix is to rename the Radiance rview program in the source and makefiles
to radview or some such and be done with it. 

Complaining about vi, vim, and standard Unix applications is not a solution,
it is just a band-aid approach. If there are other Radiance tools with
name clashes, then these tools should also be renamed. Radiance is a very 
specialized tool used by a very, very. very small number of computer users.
Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris, Cygwin, and other Unix or unix-like systems
are used by thousands of more users. If you want to make radiance more
accessible and useable by others, then one of solutions is to fix these
minor problems.

I think this only popped up with the official 3.5 release and was fixed 
by the subsequent HEAD releases.

Actually, I think there is an easier solution. If rview is renamed, then
there`s the backwards compatibility problem. But it should be possible to
use the enemie`s weapons;) as they say, every problem includes it`s own
solution. If an alias is defined, for example "rvi" (pun intended!) pointing
to radiance`s rview (it`s even two letters less to type) This could be
included in the main distribution to be used in case rview colides with vi,
and without compatibility problems. Unfortunately I don`t know how to do
this, or even if it is possible at all, but I hope it makes sense.

I looked back at the release notes, and there was a bug in Radiance 3.1 
(released Jan 2002) that caused the -pa option to fail in rpiece.  
Could this be your problem?  I just assumed you were using the latest 
version.  If there is such ann error in the 3.5 official release, this 
is the first I've heard about it.

Personally, I wouldn't have a problem with renaming the rview
program in Radiance, and I agree that it would be the cleanest
solution. Backwards compatibility problems may be solved through
an alias to the old name by those who really can't change their
habits.

I'm not sure which one came first, but the rview hard link to vi
has to be expected on every unix type system (vi is required by
posix). As has already been mentioned, we're an extremely small
minority in comparison, so if anyone should move it would be us.

Because it's by far the fastest and most efficient editor of all
I have ever tried (admittedly, only after you have climbed the
initial learning curve). Not every tool is for every person, so
you shouldn't be too surprised about other people making
different choices than you would.

Not to mention that, if I'm not mistaken, Radiance has always
been almost exclusively developed with vi (gvim in my case).

As much as I hate to change program names, I confess that I can think 
of no better alternative.  The "rview" link to vim was added in recent 
times, I guess.  I'm not even sure what it does differently.  I knew 
that the "view" command was a read-only version of "vi", so it must be 
related.

If we're going to change program names to avoid conflicts, we may as 
well do it right.  I wrote the attached script to detect identically 
named programs in a user's search path.  Just put it on your system and 
execute it:

% chmod +x radcollisions.csh
% ./radcollisions.csh

The script works by first removing components from the search path that 
lead to the program "macbethcal," which I'm assuming is 
Radiance-specific.  Here is the output from my OS X system:

% radcollisions.csh
path was ( /usr/local/ray /Users/gward/bin /usr/local/bin /bin /sbin 
/usr/bin /usr/sbin /Developer/Tools /usr/X11R6/bin . )
path changed to ( /usr/local/bin /bin /sbin /usr/bin /usr/sbin 
/Developer/Tools /usr/X11R6/bin )

/usr/bin/gencat
/usr/bin/lam
/usr/bin/rview

If people can run it on their systems and send the output directly to 
my account <gward@lmi.net>, this should give me a pretty good survey of 
what's out there.  If you want to help me even more, you can run "man 
-k" on the programs it names and send this to me as well.  This will 
give me an idea of where the conflicting programs originated.

Thanks!

Sorry Roland, I gotta side with Georg on this one.  vi was totally 
impenetrable to me at first, but as soon as I got a handle on the basic 
functions, I was totally hooked on it.  I still use GUI-fied editors 
for html and other tasks, but when editing radiance scenes I just love 
vi!

Maybe I'm just stuck in the WordStar mould, having cut my teeth on the 
old Borland development environments and the *original* WordStar. Old

Message-ID: <7300B8B9B92D1441910052FEC7D9F754053CB1@aries.burohappold.com>

Hi 

We have tried a few things here to resolve this but with no luck as yet.  We
have compiled the latest HEAD distribution.  When we run rpiece it waits
about 3 minutes before it comes up with the error, but no files are created
and no other information is written to the command line.  We have just taken
a step back and run an older model on the cluster and this ran fine with
rpiece etc.  

The model .oct we are trying to run is ~300MB in size, we created it in 7
stages with the -i switch.  we do have different -r settings for each .oct
file.  Rpeice runs fine with the model on the Linux server machine.

Almost all of the cluster machines are running Linux SuSE 8.1 with a few
running Linux Red Hat 9.0.  All have the latest official release and the
server and a few others have today's HEAD distribution.

Your help is appreciated

Regards

Andrew

We are going to rebuild the .oct tonight just in case.

Hi Andrew,

This error sounds suspiciously like a communication problem between 
rpiece and rpict, since the resolution string is the first thing rpiece 
tries to read back from rpict.  I'm sure it doesn't have anything to do 
with the octree or the -x and -y options or where they appear.  Does 
rpiece die right away, or only after it's done some work?  What 
machine(s) are you running on?  Rpiece talks to its rpict process over 
a standard Unix pipe/socket, which should be reliable.  I'm quite 
puzzled by this error -- has anyone else on the list gotten this before?

Can you provide the exact error message? (copy and paste).
Both rpiece and rpict can complain about "resolution mismatch",
in different contexts, and the messages vary only slightly.
I don't think we established yet which of the three possible
problems that I can see we're actually talking about.


> We are going to rebuild the .oct tonight just in case.

"Resolution mismatch" is about pixel resolution in images,
and has nothing to do with your octree.

Hi All,

I recently used ximage for the first time to get average illuminance values

well for a rectangular room. Does anybody know if there is a way to do this
for slanted or even completely irregular spaces with curves etc...

Can you provide the exact error message? (copy and paste).
Both rpiece and rpict can complain about "resolution mismatch",
in different contexts, and the messages vary only slightly.
I don't think we established yet which of the three possible
problems that I can see we're actually talking about.

"Resolution mismatch" is about pixel resolution in images,
and has nothing to do with your octree.

Hi Andrew,

 From your error message, it looks like rpict is dying before it ever 
gets going.  The partial error message "rpict: signal - " is 
particularly telling.  Rpict apparently dies before it even finishes 
its error message!  The "rpiece: resolution mismatch from rpict" is 
produced by rpiece after rpict dies - it's not part of the same 
message.

My guess is that rpict is using more memory than it's allowed on your 
node(s).  In csh/tcsh, the command:

	% limit

Tells you your current resource limit settings for individual 
processes.  If "datasize" or "memoryuse" are anything besides 
"unlimited," try typing:

	% unlimit datasize
	% unlimit memoryuse

There are some limits that may be imposed by the system administrator, 
I think, and you may not be able to increase past a certain size, but 
the above commands should give you the maximum values for each.  While 
you're at it, do the same for the "cputime" variable.  I recommend 
adding the above lines to your script, so you don't have to remember to 
do it each time you start the script.  Alternatively, you could add the 
above to your .cshrc file if you are running the C-shell, which is NOT 
the default shell under Linux.  (I don't know how to control limits in 
the other shells -- I assume you can, though.)

If the resource limit settings are not the problem, it may be that you 
are running out of swap space on your nodes, and you'll need to 
increase your swap partition or add another swap device/file to get it 
to run at all.

-Greg

ulimit -a
for bash users

you may want to run 'top' (hit m to get into memory mode) to see what 
happens with rpict.
xosview is another nice way to check what your systems are doing. You 
should see swap space or memory diminishing before rpict dies, if that 
is the scenario.

Hi

Ok sorry if this is a stupid question but here goes...

Got a new HD and decided to do a clean install of 10.3 and to reinstall 
Radiance.
(I'd been using it without xwindows).

Initially just did radiance-rad3R5.tgz
- didn't worry about the auxilary files because apparently that's just 
'images'  (a major understatement).

Radiance installs and works fine - except.. missing all the useful 
stuff such as 'pfilt'  'pcond', and a zillion other goodies all in the 
rad3R5supp.tar.gz  - but this doesn't have an install program.

OK so when the 2 downloads are unpacked i have 2 directories 'ray' and 
' ray1' (auxilary files).

Almost seems as though I need to go through ray1 and shift the various 
programs across to their corresponding directory in ray. (can't be 
right, can it?).

I resorted to the LBNL download (which isn't split) but then hit a 
whole bunch of compilation errors (the installer is pretty different 
there too - for instance it doesn't ask for the users system or where 
library files should go). Spent a long time on trying to solve possible 
causes without much luck...

It would be great if someone could let me know what is required to 
install the auxilary files having installed the head.

thanks
alex

well, mate. It says "e.g. images" not "just images" . Quote:

    Steps to install Radiance from source:

       1. download one CVS tar ball (stable or pre-release version)
       2. download tar ball of auxilary files
       3. unpack both tar balls (unpacks to directory /ray/) : |gunzip <
          /file/ | tar xf -|
       4. |cd ray; makeall install|

Let me know how the clearity of that could be enhanced and I add it.
The reason to split is that the "aux" files don't change as frequently 
as some parts of the source do. So, to be updated, folks just need the 
nightly "HEAD" version and not the whole bunch. (In fact only the diff 
patches are needed for those still behind a slow modem line).

They both unpack into a subdir 'ray' . Your "ray1" is generated by your 
download/unpack program, presumably to intelligently avoid cluttering 
the already existing subdir 'ray' .

I don't know if and how the packages at LBNL are updated.

Message-ID: <7300B8B9B92D1441910052FEC7D9F754053CB8@aries.burohappold.com>

Many thanks for all of the replies, 

The 'top' command is indeed top, never knew that existed and it proved to be
a great help in solving this problem.  The limits for data and infact most
settings were already 'unlimited' when we checked so we were left with
watching 'top' to see what happened.

The machines we were running on generally had 64MB of RAM with 128MB swap
partitions, we added a couple of machines that had 128MB RAM with 1.2GB
swap, anyway when we ran rpeice on the higher spec machines with 'top'
running we saw that rpict peaked at 640MB of RAM use and rpiece / rpict
completed without failing.  When we ran rpiece on the lower spec machines
the error 'mismatch resolution etc' occurred exactly as we ran out of RAM
and SWAP space.

It is interesting to note that a ~300MB .oct requires 640MB or RAM and SWAP
space.

Once again thanks for the help, it's good to have found out more about Linux
as well as Radiance.  The only problem we have now is rebuilding our cluster
machines to increase the SWAP space.

Best Regards

Andrew

you may want to run 'top' (hit m to get into memory mode) to see what

xosview is another nice way to check what your systems are doing. You

Thanks Peter mate!

What can I say apart from mea culpa  and 'doh'!
Well it had been long arduous night resurrecting my machine exactly as 
i had it prior to the clean install...
Did that show? :-)

Yes, the page is pretty clear now in the cold light of morning.
Still if i have any suggestions I'll send them on to you directly.

If i get some spare time, i might have a stab at doing a background 
guide for putting Radiance on 10.3.

For instance stuff like remembering to custom install Panther so you 
can put on X11 (i assumed wrongly that it was on the developer tools 
CD) - or if 10.3 has already updated itself to 10.3.1, doing the custom 
install directly off the 3rd system disk to avoid the software trying 
to reinstall 10.3.

cheers

your download/unpack program, presumably to intelligently avoid
cluttering the already existing subdir 'ray' .


<excerpt>Almost seems as though I need to go through ray1 and shift
the various programs across to their corresponding directory in ray.
(can't be right, can it?).


I resorted to the LBNL download (which isn't split) but then hit a
whole bunch of compilation errors (the installer is pretty different
there too - for instance it doesn't ask for the users system or where
library files should go). Spent a long time on trying to solve
possible causes without much luck...

I don't know if and how the packages at LBNL are updated.

Hi all,

The brute force method I have used to get Radiance installed on my OS X 
machines have been to download the pre-compiled binaries from the LBNL 
site, as well as the Head and Auxilliary files from 
radiance-online.org.  After copying all the binaries to /usr/local/bin 
from the pre-compiled binaries, I then ran through the ./makeall 
install script from the Head.  Don't know how kosher this is, but it 
seems to have worked.

Hi Santiago and everybody else in this thread

Thought i'd follow your suggestion and see if i could get an alias to 
work and so avoid the rview - vi problem. (More importantly i needed to 
get the raypath to be set properly in X11).

Key thing seems to be that while .bash_profile may work for terminal (a 
nod to Rob here), for Xwindows all those settings need to be put in 
.bashrc  (well at least that was all that would work for me - it seems 
to ignore .bash_profile .login .profile  etc.etc.).

In .bashrc put:

PATH=.:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/bin/ray:$PATH
RAYPATH=.:/usr/local/lib/ray
alias rvw='/usr/local/bin/ray/rview'
export PATH RAYPATH

Just to clarify - i find it better to install Radiance binaries in 
usr/local/bin/ray - and so keep them distinct from the other binaries i 
have in bin.
Those who use he default location would have:
alias rvw='/usr/local/bin/rview'

But anyway the alias trick seems to work fine with 'rvw' or 'rvi' or 
whatever.
It's certainly useful for a reducing the typing on other commands as 
well.

I guess another one of those things that would be useful in a single 
point guideline for installing into Panther.

Hi,

hmmm... maybe this has been on the dev-list before, but if this feature 
can be used like this without problems - will it be included in the 
main distribution of radiance one day?

Good question -- that's up to Fraunhofer and Berkeley, I guess. I don't 
expect that to be resolved anytime soon... :^(

This is largely my fault for not taking the time to really go through 
the photon map changes to see what they were about.  I started looking 
through Roland's docs a year ago, and never got back to it.  I simply 
haven't had time to play with it, and I don't see the time appearing 
anywhere in the immediate future.

If the photon map had been implemented as a mkillum substitute, i.e., a 
separate program that creates light sources for Radiance, there would 
be no hesitation to include it in the main distribution.  In that case, 
there would have been no risk whatsoever to the renderer, and it 
wouldn't have affected any of the rendering options.  However, my 
understanding is that the photon map has been folded right into the 
main rendering code, with quite a few new options associated with its 
use.  This makes it critical to do a fitness evaluation before we fold 
it into the main source, and that requires testing.

We need to take a very careful look at this module's affect on the code 
as well as the rendering process -- does it support all material types 
(or at least do something reasonable with the types it doesn't 
support)?  Does it place any restrictions on light sources?  
Participating media?  How does it behave when the geometry gets 
complex?  Does it burden or otherwise affect the calculation when it is 
switched off?  Do we get the same results or nearly the same under all 
important circumstances?

These concerns must be answered, and I'm sure Roland can answer some of 
them.  For other concerns, I'll just have to pour over the source code 
and test it and test it.  It would be very helpful to me if Roland and 
I could get together and run through everything, but that hasn't 
happened, and e-mail gets mixed in with all the other activities we 
have going on, making communication slow and difficult.

I really appreciate the efforts Roland has put forth to get this out, 
and to keep it updated with the latest source changes on our end.  I 
know this is no small task, and it feels cruel to make new releases 
without incorporating his changes, because it just means more work for 
him without any real benefit.

It would help me to hear from users who have successfully applied the 
photon map.  I'd like to see how it helped them and hear what they have 
to say about it, on the list or off.  Theoretical discussions and 
people saying this is a "good idea" are useful only up to a point.  
Real experience is what matters, and that's what I need to hear from 
people.  I have not used the photon map myself at this point, so I have 
no direct experience of my own.

Thanks,
-Greg
