Subject: [Radiance-general] ranimate question
Message-ID: <7B2F6EA5E35E214882CB9828962BC3CF04D693D3@corvallis.summit.fiserv.com>

Now that I've generated an anim.vf file, I want to use ranimate.
I create test3.ran

#test3.ran
# The rad input file for our static scene:
#RIF= test3.rif
OCT= test3.oct
render=   -ms 0.56 -ds .2 -dt .05 -dc .75 -dr 3 -sj 1 -st .01  -af
test3a.amb -aa .1 -lr 12 -lw .0005 -ar 80 -ad 512 -as 256 -ab 2
#the spool directory:
DIRECTORY= anim
# The view file containing one view per frame:
VIEWFILE= anim.vf
# The amount of temporary disk space available:
DISKSPACE= 50   # megabytes

When I try
% ranimate test3.ran
I get an error - Segmentation fault
(looking in the archives, I've seen that error with mkillum, but not
ranimate)

So I try
% ranimate -n -e test3.ran 
then copy the1st  rpict line

rpict -ms 0.56 -ds .2 -dt .05 -dc .75 -dr 3 -sj 1 -st .01 -af test3a.amb -aa
.1 -lr 12 -lw .0005 -ar 80 -ad 512 -as 256 -ab 2 -vp -67.215 -32.308 12.2963
-vd 0.840767 0.510078 -0.198076 -vh 50 -vv 50 -w0 -o anim/frame%03d.unf -x
1280 -y 1280 -S 1 test3.oct < anim/anim.vf

and paste it into a new shell

That starts to work - producing .unf files
I could do that, but then I'd have to pfilt each frame and remove the .unf
files

let me know if you need more details

Thanks

I think you are right: it should be due to the low light levels => scotopic
vision (option -c in pcond simulate this and it is bundled in the -h
option).
if you want to exclude the -c option, try to use "pcond -a+ -v+ -s+" instead
of "pcond -h+"

Hi all,

just wanted to get rid of a short announcement:


  Two Radiance Based German Language Training Events.


  3D-Lighting Software Tutorial
  Thu, May 6th 2004
  http://www.al-ware.com/index.php?CATID=242&SUBCATID=243&LANGID=6

  Practical Lighting Seminar
  Thu, May 7th 2004
  http://www.al-ware.com/index.php?CATID=242&SUBCATID=244&LANGID=6

  Simulation Laboratory
  Institute for Building and Solar Technology IGS
  Technical University Braunschweig
  Germany


Those two events are planned by Andreas Lahme from ALWare, who
has been (and still is) developing 3DSolar, the building modeller
software for Rayfront/Radiance, as well as a suite of analysis
and documentation tools.

We will be holding the tutorial session together. Andreas will
teach modelling and analysis, I will teach the Radiance/Rayfront
related parts. We will first introduce the simulation principles,
and then walk the participants through projects interactively.
This course is meant for people who are interested to see whether
the presented software is suitable to solve their problems, but
existing users are of course also welcome.

Andreas will teach the Seminar with Prof. Friedrich Sick.
The focus of this part is less on pressing the right buttons,
but more on solving practical problems in daylighting design.
The subject matter includes daylighting fundamentals, design
procedures, evaluation criteria, and the economical use of the
available software tools. The target audience are architects and
engineers who want a to reach a better understanding on how to
work with daylight when designing buildings.

Both events are in german language. There are computers available
(probably one per two participants) for an immediate hands-on
learning experience. Demonstration examples may be adapted to the
interests of the participants, or even fully contributed by them.
It is possible to participate for only one day (270.- Euro + VAT),
or for both together (486.- Euro + VAT).

If you're interested, please contact Andreas Lahme for further
details and registration info:

Message-ID: <20040406134628.50045.qmail@web11301.mail.yahoo.com>

Hello,
I am a graduate student in architecture at the
University of Waterloo, Canada. My thesis centres on
the modelling of two Canadian 'sustainable' buildings
to investigate the relationship between daylighting
and energy consumption for heating and cooling. I am
modelling each building in Desktop Radiance in order
to evaluate the performance of both Ecotect and
Energy-10 in daylighting analysis.

I had hoped to use Desktop Radiance to evaluate
daylight factors in key areas of the buildings. While
I am able to model fairly realistic interior
illumination results and analyse these using the False
Colour plot I have encountered several problems:

1. When I opt for a daylight factor plot, the scale
remains at a range of 0 to 1.0 and is unaffected by
any changes I try to make through the analysis
dialogue box.  The result in Radiance is a washed out
image all in the 'maximum' colour (my other software
suggests DF% between 2 and 4%) confirming DF%>1.0
How can I adjust the scale for DF% readings in Desktop
Radiance?

2. I am trying to assess the effect of changing
glazing types. For daylight studies in the late winter
afternoon (based on sun charts and other software, I'm
using 4pm Dec21, where the sun is not yet set, but
very low in the sky), where I have not modelled any
surrounding obstructions such as trees or buildings,
my internal illuminance levels are consistently about
200 lux, even on the east side of the building. Common
sense tells me there should be MUCH MUCH less light
than this...probably no more than 100 lux. Also, when
changing glazing types (ie, from clear to reflective)
a significant change is noticed for noon hour
lighting, but the 4pm Dec21 lighting remains at 200
lux. What could I be mis-assuming?

I have recently run a few simplified test models and
compared my results to true exterior light conditions
using a hand-held light meter. The results are
somewhat frustrating, but interesting nonetheless.

My questions here are particularly:
3. How does Radiance calculate the external light
levels?
4. On a perfectly clear morning in a low pollution
area (assumed turbidity=2) my light meter reading read
approx. 55600 lux. A Radiance test (modelling an
unobstructed horizontal plane outdoors) for the same
date and time, and lat. long settings, with
turbidity=2 produced an exterior light level of 47000
lux (15% off the true reading!). While there may have
been some diffuse reflection off nearby buildings,
there was certainly no direct reflection or shadow on
the light meter. This seems to be much too large a
difference. Any suggestions?

Apologies for the long email. I often read that these
software applications are tested and confirmed but my
data isn't showing an appropriate correlation of the
simulation to reality. Any remarks would be greatly
appreciated.

I did some validation measurements, some years ago, for my thesis... (not as
good as some others did before me... )
The values I had were quite different from the expected (radiance
calculated).
At the time I had not reliable information on the value of the turbidity
factor for the area I was studying.... what happened then it is another
story...
but going back to your problem:

I think that calculated illuminance can be the same only if you have a way
of measuring the sky luminance distribution.... (not CIE standard but
real...)
I think that the best paper you can find on it is the Mardaljevic PHD
thesis...
(http://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm/sg98.htm)

The values that you have aren't so bad... compared to mine (I remember
something like 30% RER..)  
;-((

PS - a recent post pointed out the limits of simulating low altitude sun
skies... (Perez sky model have the same limitation with low angles, where
uncertainty is really high) ... so the only way is to override the sky
definition and constrain it to a known illuminance value... I guess... but
you have still no way of knowing the luminance dist...
---------------------
about the falsecolor images you should try to use on the dos terminal:
falsecolor -s maxvalue -n numberof intervals -l label -m multiplier -i
yourpicture > finalimage

if gives you an error try this:
falsecolor -s maxvalue -n numberof intervals -l label -m multiplier -ip
yourpicture > finalimage

where multiplier is:
179 for illuminance and luminance (depending on the type of image)
179/external_illuminance for daylight factor plots

Hi Caroline,

First off, there is a Desktop-Radiance Yahoo forum, and you should 
definitely ask around on there too, especially for your falsecolor scale 
questions.  I'm not familiar with the Windows version(s) of the various 
Radiance binaries.

Giulio gave you some good leads there regarding sky simulations.  This 
kind of question pops up on here regularly, and indeed I went through 
the exact same experience as you.  I'd read about how accurate Radiance 
could be (read that again, the semantics are important), then did my 
first daylight simulation and was disappointed.  Lots of words have been 
put down on paper about the difference between real, measured skies and 
simulated ones.  Papers with lots of Greek symbols fill the servers at 
universities & research facilities worldwide.  Greg Ward can cut through 
the haze as well as anyone regarding this, but being all smart and 
"mathy", his explanations still confused me for a while.  Eventually I 
got it:

Nature is way too complicated.  To think that one or even a thousand 
formulas could mathematically describe the luminance distribution of the 
nearly infinite number of skies is pure folly.

What has been proven by Dr. Mardaljevic is that Radiance can simulate 
lit environments with a high degree of accuracy.  What he had was an 
incredibly fine dataset of real sky luminance and building interior 
illuminance.  When this data was fed to Radiance, he got very close to 
the same answers.  But most of us do *not* have an incredibly fine 
dataset of real sky luminance and building interior illuminance, we have 
a lat/long, maybe some sky turbidity info, and the woefully inadequate 
suite of sky conditions descriptors "clear, intermediate and overcast". 
  Whoopie. So, it's no wonder that our initial forays into daylight 
simulation with Radiance tend to be confidence shakers.

The truth is Radiance can be as accurate as you want, but most of us are 
starting with input that is inherently inaccurate.  It's a good starting 
point, but you simply can't expect your results to match up to reality 
with any kind of high precision when using these basic CIE skies.  Don't 
get me wrong, the CIE skies can still be used to make valid design 
decisions, and certainly comparative studies of building form and 
material will be quite valid.  But it's when people want to take a light 
meter and have the LCD display show the same number that Radiance spat 
out that the disappointment creeps in.  For pure numeric accuracy, which 
Dr. M proved is possible, you need more measured info about your site. 
My experience with Radiance is that it's very very good, certainly the 
best available tool out there for daylighting analysis.  But I don't 
expect my numbers to be ?5%, or even ?10% sometimes.  But I believe ?20% 
is a fair goal.  Our faith in the numbers is based on experience and 
intuition and we have to work hard to get this point across to our 
clients all the time.  In my view, it's been worth the effort.

Hopefully the Greek symbols types will weigh in on this too; it's an 
interesting topic.

And, while I'm thinking of it, from Ian Ashdown's excellent "Thinking 
Photometrically" Lightfair course notes 
(http://www.helios32.com/Thinking%20Photometrically%20II.pdf):

"One major problem is that the calculations are necessarily based on the 
various CIE or IESNA sky models, which predict illuminances based on 
average sky conditions. It is not uncommon for instantaneous measured 
illuminances to be more than twice or less than half of the mean 
illuminances predicted by clear and overcast sky models; the situation
for partly cloudy skies is even worse.

"As for daylighting calculations, it is likely that Jongewaard (1993) is 
correct ? the results are only as accurate as the accuracy of the input 
data. Done with care, it should be possible to obtain ?20 percent 
accuracy in the photometric predictions. However, this requires detailed 
knowledge and accurate modeling of both the indoor and outdoor 
environments. If this cannot be done, it may be advisable to walk softly 
and carry a calibrated photometer.

Howdy,

Just a note to let you all know, I just installed the latest HEAD 
release on a Fedora Core 1 Linux box, and had the same libtiff errors 
that Etienne Canard had back in January.  Luckily Mark Stock's tip 
worked, from this post:

http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-January/001422.html

Thanks Mark!  Users who get this error will not have any of the binaries 
from the /src/px directory built, not just ximage and the others that 
Etienne mentioned in his post.

I thought I'd mention this since Red Hat is dropping support for RHL9 at 
the end of the month, and I'd expect a few of you out there will be 
migrating to Fedora. (?)

P.S.
After installing Fedora (http://fedora.redhat.com/) on a test server, 
and liking what I saw, I have installed it on my production Radiance box 
and thanks to Mark I now have Radiance running on it, and it's really 
quite nice.  And the yum package manager is downright yummy!  =8-)

I've messed again with the Radiance-code and produced  a first (still 
unfinished) test  version of RADZILLA.

Beware, this is nothing for the faint hearted, as a lot of things are 
currently in progress, experimental, not
implemented yet, whatever. Despite this, this current test version is 
already quite useful especially for visualization projects..

So all you Indiana Jones's of raytracing: check out

be prepared for everything and have FUN!

What can I say besides, "Wow!"  This is very exciting.  I'm glad that 
you felt inspired to work on this, as this seems like a whole new 
direction and potential for our little community.  I encourage people 
to try it out, do comparisons, validations, etc.  I've thought many 
times of rewriting Radiance over the years, and never managed to find 
the funds or free time even to begin.  Thanks, Carsten!!

I read through the release notes, and I have an announcement:
The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated.  And AFAIK, Roland 
(whom you also refer to as late & great) is great, but definitely not 
late.  =8-)

I played with RADZILLA briefly during lunch here.  Some notes:
1. Your source code compiled just fine on Fedora Core 1.
2. How do I specify a .rif file with radz?
3. Getinfo likes radzilla octrees, but the 
model-viewing-utility-formerly-named-rview does not.  I guess that's 
because getinfo is simply a header reader, whereas rview is dealing with 
the octree more intimately.  Any plans to make an rzrvu?  Will you paint 
my house when you're done re-writing Radiance?

Keep up the good work!  Interesting stuff, Carsten.  This is such a fun 
group.

radz can be handled like rad (except the mandatory executable name), so type
radz -x rzpict 'riffilename' with 'riffilename' being a normal RADIANCE 
.rif file

Concerning further stuff (rzrvu): It should be rather straightforward to 
convert e.g. rvu to deal with
RADZILLA octrees as well, once the general framework is established. So 
you can expect more functionality coming soon.

Just a quick note: I'm currently on a one weeks holiday, so this 
certainly means some delay on my side for answering questions  etc. But 
I'll be back working on the stuff next week...

And concering your house: It depends what kind of artwork you want your 
house to be after I'm finished with it ..:-)

No problem with that rendering. Just an expectation-mismatch.
What you see in the window is not the "other side", but rather
the reflection of the scene behind you. The interior is much
too dark in comparison to be visible.

Ahhhh ok, makes sense... this is not what I was expecting. As the inside
is dark, and so is the glass, I was expecting the glass not to reflect
much light? What properties do I need to play with to get what I was
expecting, ie darker looking glass from the outside, not reflecting
much? You must know what I mean, like stainglass on churches, its very
murky from outside, definetly cant see much reflection in it.

If you're using trans for the glass, you could give it some roughness; 
that would help.  I think there's also a .cal file that simulates a 
dirty surface?  Both things would help your cause. Right now you have a 
mirror-smooth surface there, which I believe is causing your problem there.

You could simply make the reflected component diffuse, which
is probably quite appropriate for this kind of glazing.
Especially on the outside, the appearance is usually
determined by dirt...

Hi,
 
I am trying to simulate the extinction of light inside a MIST volume, for
different sky conditions.
The simulations seems to work well using "sun" as the light source, but I
have problems when using an overcast sky or a sunny sky with no sun (-s
option).
The light sources for the MIST volume are "sun" and "sky" which is defined
using glow.
Did MIST work for glow type light sources? If not, what do you recommend to
use to simulate this case, with diffuse light coming from the sky?
 
Thank you in advance,

hi,
glow is considered as a light source by the direct component only within the
given distance (4th number of glow definition) and I guess "mist" doesn't
consider glow with 0 (or -1) because it is not a direct light source.
 
a quick and probably useless (**) trick is to change the sky description 
 
from
skyfunc glow skyglow
0
0
3 1 1  1
to
 
skyfunc light skyglow
0
0
3 1 1  1
 
this way the 1st bounce is now direct but -ds doesn't work on the sky and
there is just a big point source above so ...  (**) 
 
another trick (this time should be ok) is to create a big polygonal volume
of brightfunc-light-sources with the sky distribution... in this case you
could be able to use -ds.
 
hope it helps,
 
giulio

ERRATA CORRIGE
apparently -ds doesn't do the trick of subdividing the source for the mist...
if you are simulating light from windows this shouldn't be an issue
but if you have an open volume of atmosphere you may see bright areas of
mist in corrispondence of the sources centres (depending on your mist settings).

I guess the reason is that it is more efficient to only test the centre
as usually sources are small compared to the scene dimensions... in your
case it is the opposite... 
any ideas how to solve this (a part using tons of small sources)?

Unfortunately, mist is never going to work with distant sources, 
because if your raise any extinction to an infinite power, no matter 
how close to one it starts out, you get a zero result.  (From RwR Chap. 
14, eq. 14.7, we see that light is absorbed as the power of distance.)  
I just had a similar discussion with another user (Pablo Escanilla 
<pabloe@ivo.cps.unizar.es>), who was simulating fog on a roadway.

Real atmospheres are quite a bit more complex than setting a global 
constant value for extinction and albedo.  Real atmospheres change with 
altitude, often dramatically, so it doesn't become pitch dark as soon 
as the fog rolls in.  Simulating large scale atmospherics in Radiance 
means creating enormous "slabs" of mist with different extinctions at 
different altitudes.  It can be done, but it's a bit of a pain and, as 
far as I know, no one has yet made the attempt.

As to sampling the sky dome, this is never going to work.  You are much 
better off setting a sensible value for -av, which gets figured into 
the mist calculation as an appropriate multiplier on albedo.  This was 
my advice to Pablo.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance simulations maintain 200 lux minimum?
Message-ID: <20040416185745.37206.qmail@span.corp.yahoo.com>

Hello,
I have been running several simulations in Radiance
for Winter and Summer solstice at Toronto latitudes.
For noon hour simulations the results are quite
believable along perimeter areas. I have noticed
however, that no matter what changes I make to my
model, the lowest illuminance reading I can generate
anywhere inside a daylit room is between 150 and 200
lux. For afternoon models where the sun is at a
low-angle, the core areas of my models should be below
50 lux (from in-situ light measurements). I understand
Radiance has trouble with low-angle sun simulations.
But when I look at my noon hour models (sun very
high), I notice that my core readings are also all
around 200 lux...seemingly unable to drop below 200
lux. My false colour plots do show minimum extrema
lower than 200 lux, and areas in direct shadow, are
shown more blue (closer to 50 lux on my scale). From
in-situ measurements at desk height, though, it would
seem that the drop off of illuminance levels from the
perimeter to the core of a room is not adequately
represented in my Radiance models. Can anyone offer a
suggestion why my illuminance values, for the most
part, bottom out at 200 lux?

Regards,
Caroline

Hi Caroline,

There are as many possible reasons to your problem as there are option 
settings in rpict.  (I.e., a lot.)  You have to give us a little more 
detail about what settings you are using in your rad input file (if 
you're using rad) or your rendering/simulation command (if you're 
calling rpict or rtrace directly).  Posting an image if you have a 
website is also an incredible help.  If you haven't generated any 
images, I recommend you do so, even if you don't require them for your 
analysis.  Renderings are one of the best debugging tools ever 
conceived.

Message-ID: <000001c42542$85c49a20$2300a8c0@cumberland>

After setting up some candles in my reconstruction using georg's advice
with the candle RGB values. I used spheres with radius 0.0075 which
worked out RGB values of
 
R=16.575
G=5.240
B=0
 
For the flames light material.( The base weightings of rgb for tallow
candle flame were R 0.759 G 0.240 B 0)
 
For a tallow candle, emitting 1 candela of light. When using these
values my night renders look like this:
 
http://homepage.ntlworld.com/mark.sutherland/internaltallow-h.jpg
 
Which is not quite what I was expecting using pcond. I get the
impression my lighting values are too low? But the results aren't too
bad, so I thought I'd try to illuminating of a manuscript.
 
In this next render I moved the candle right up close to the manuscript
(its just off the bottom), but the illumination is not really enough to
shift the book out of scotopic levels.
 
http://homepage.ntlworld.com/mark.sutherland/outputbook22hrtallow-h.jpg
 
A false colour image shows they levels barely get above 1.5 lux
 
http://homepage.ntlworld.com/mark.sutherland/outputbook22hrtallow-hfalse

I thought id try a home experiment, I lit a candle in a pitch black room
and moved a book varing distances away from the candle, and there was
very little scotopic vision even at a distance of about a metre away.
When I do a render without the candles at night the falsecolour images
show very little increase in lux. Is lux a very sensitive scale? A small
tiny increase in lux real life increases the visability a lot? But pcond
's filter is not sensitive enough, and also the limitation of the
monitors contrast and lighting abilities not enough to show any
difference? So many questions!
 
The problem is that using the RGB lighting values suggested, they don't
appear to be able to illuminate the manuscript to a reasonable looking
level, even though in real life a candle could. Wheres my problem?

Thank you very much for your answer.

My intention was not simulating light extinction through the atmosphere but
once light reaches a mist object which is on the ground, (I exactly know the
extinction coefficient within it), analyze the light (direct from sun and
diffuse from sky dome) extinction inside this small volume.

Since I need to know the light levels (illuminance) inside the volume at
different depths, it seems to me that the -av approach will not work.

Any suggestion?

Thanks in advance,
Guedi

Subject: Re: Using MIST for overcast sky

Unfortunately, mist is never going to work with distant sources,
because if your raise any extinction to an infinite power, no matter
how close to one it starts out, you get a zero result.  (From RwR Chap.
14, eq. 14.7, we see that light is absorbed as the power of distance.)
I just had a similar discussion with another user (Pablo Escanilla
<pabloe@ivo.cps.unizar.es>), who was simulating fog on a roadway.

Real atmospheres are quite a bit more complex than setting a global
constant value for extinction and albedo.  Real atmospheres change with
altitude, often dramatically, so it doesn't become pitch dark as soon
as the fog rolls in.  Simulating large scale atmospherics in Radiance
means creating enormous "slabs" of mist with different extinctions at
different altitudes.  It can be done, but it's a bit of a pain and, as
far as I know, no one has yet made the attempt.

As to sampling the sky dome, this is never going to work.  You are much
better off setting a sensible value for -av, which gets figured into
the mist calculation as an appropriate multiplier on albedo.  This was
my advice to Pablo.

Hi,

I am trying to simulate the extinction of light inside a MIST volume,
for different sky conditions.

The simulations seems to work well using "sun" as the light source, but
I have problems when using an overcast sky or a sunny sky with no sun
(-s option).

The light sources for the MIST volume are "sun" and "sky" which is
defined using glow.

Did MIST work for glow type light sources? If not, what do you
recommend to use to simulate this case, with diffuse light coming from
the sky?

Thank you in advance,

Guedi

Message-ID: <s0826bc3.082@wmtao.com>

** Proprietary **

Group,

A couple of months ago I ran a series of simulations tracking the sun
across a space.  Since then I've gone back and tried to clean up and
improve the animations (for marketing purposes) only I've run into what
seems to be either a glitch or more likely a user error.  I'm using rad
and ranimate to automate the process.

My rif file looks like this...

EXPOSURE= 1
DETAIL= H
EYESEP= .225
INDIRECT= 2
materials= ./material/mat.rad
OCTREE= ./octree/lobby_a.oct
PENUMBRAS= T

UP= Z
VARIABILITY= H
view= vw1 -vf ./views/v1.vp
ZONE= I 0 17 0 19 0 9
render= -t 10

My ran file looks like this...

BASENAME= anim2/frame%03d
DIRECTORY= anim2
DISKSPACE= 500
START= 1
END= 53
host= localhost
INTERPOLATE= 0
MBLUR= 0
OVERSAMPLE= 3

RSH= rsh
RTRACE= F
VIEWFILE= ./views/v1.vp
ANIMATE= genoctree_a.script
EXPOSURE= ./exposure/exp_a_interpolated_15.rad
RIF= lobby_a.rif

And my octree generator looks like this...

frame=$1
tmp=sun.rad
time=`ev "5.25+($frame/4)"`
gensky 3 21 $time +s -a 38.7 -o 90.5 -m 90 > $tmp
oconv -i ./octree/lobby_a1.oct -f $tmp sky.rad
rm $tmp

The problem is that the illum.dat files are not being updated for each
image and considering the fact that the sky is changing for each frame,
it seems to me like they should be.  Perhaps ranimate was really only
meant to deal with static lighting scenes with movable objects/camera
positions?

Any comments would be appreciated.

Thanks!

Huh?  If this information is really "proprietary," the last thing you 
should be doing is posting it to a public discussion list.  I assume 
you meant another word, here.

Indeed, ranimate's support of changing illumination and geometry is 
minimal.  You are responsible for any frame updates yourself within 
your "genoctree_a.script" file.  You are free to use rad to help you 
with this.  Your script file currently changes the sky and expects 
ranimate to figure out what that means, but how could it?  What you 
need to do is make the octree created by rad depend on some file that 
is altered in your script, like so:

	frame=$1
	time=`ev "5.25+($frame/4)"`
	gensky 3 21 $time +s -a 38.7 -o 90.5 -m 90 > sun.rad
	rad -v 0
	cat ./octree/lobby_a.oct

Then, to "lobby_a.rif" you should add:

	scene= sun.rad sky.rad

Your current rad input file is broken in the sense that it doesn't have 
the information it needs to generate correct illum's.  This is where 
your problems began.

Hope this helps.

Hi Guedi,

Well, then you can try Pillo's suggestion of simulating the sky as many 
small sources, but I don't hold out much hope that you'll get an 
accurate answer.  What local phenomenon are you trying to simulate, 
exactly?  A puff of smoke?

            While other can remark on pcond and how it represents
scotopic/photopic adaptation, I would like to comment on the lighting
design issue. The close-up of the manuscript indicates a dominant
grazing highlight from the right and less contribution from the left. I
also note the shadows cast by the candle configuration.. front candles
blocking rear candles... at least that is my guess.  Consider
reorganizing the candles so that each has a full "sightline" to the
manuscript. Additionally increase the luminance of the page by moving
the candles closer and by reducing the cosine effect by repositioning.
To reduce the masking shadow cast by a reader, consider elevating the
light sources.
            Radiance provides fairly accurate representations of
lighting choices. Though there have been a few occasions where I gasped
with disbelief at a rendering of a lighting scheme I was testing, I must
acknowledge that Radiance typically illustrates the flaws and strengths
of the design choices.

Thanks Greg,

Our intention is to simulate light extinction inside a tree (yes yes...a
tree) or a group of trees with the purpose of studying light penetration
according to different morphologies. The mist approach looked to me much
simpler than modeling the whole tree (or a lot of trees), considering than
even in this case the model will be just an approximation.

Anyway I will try constructing a dome from polygons
brightfunc-light-sources, as Giulio suggested.

Hi Mark,

I hope by this you mean that you were able to solve your problem.  Good

have written:

	frame=$1

Message-ID: <20040419163606.56522.qmail@web11307.mail.yahoo.com>

Hello all,

As Greg suggested, I have posted my results to my
website. No fancy links between them, and the text
files are done as jpegs, but the info is there.

I ran simulations of a 15m x 15m room. The west wall
has 4 windows and the north, south and east walls each
have 1 central window. I simulated December 21st in
Toronto for noon, 4pm and 6pm. According to other
software and my weather data, there is no sunlight at
6pm on Dec21, and the sun is quite low, but not yet
set at 4pm. I did not model any exterior obstructions.

Using the Desktop Radiance interface in AutoCAD I
generated .rif files for the time/day selections
(Radiance>Simulation>Camera...). Then in Command
Prompt I performed RAD on the various .rif files.

The sky definitions all appear identical, except for
the time markers in the top line.
The .riff and sky.rad files are posted here:
http://www.geocities.com/cjprocha/Sky_and_Rif_files.jpg

The RAD command ran through my camera views
successfully, but generated some warnings:
warning - no light source found. Well of course, I
have no luminaires (as suggested in the Desktop
Radiance FAQ), I am studying daylighting, so I presume
I can move on despite this message.
and
warning - aiming failure for light source
"softwaretest4_38.4.2". Looking at the DesktopRadiance
FAQ, online, there would not seem to be any reason for
this warning, based on the model I have drawn. No
concave items, no cylinders, no rings with holes, etc.

The entire script for my RAD run of Dec 21 at noon is
posted here:
http://www.geocities.com/cjprocha/Rad_Script.jpg
apologies for the fuzziness.

So the resulting images are posted as follows:
December 21, noon:
http://www.geocities.com/cjprocha/Dec21_12_ca6_images.jpg
December 21, 4pm:
http://www.geocities.com/cjprocha/Dec21_16_ca6_images.jpg
December 21, 6pm:
http://www.geocities.com/cjprocha/Dec21_18_ca6_images.jpg
The false color maps are generated within the winimage
screen (Analysis>False color>choose metric,
illuminance, max=1000, intervals=10)

Note the centre of the floor of the room (roughly the
centre of the floor area as I have cast my camera
view) is near 200 lux in all three cases, even when
there are no luminaires and the scene is after
sun-set.

I've also noticed that the 6pm version produces an
ambient glow in the room, both in general and more
specifically along the ceiling edge. Where is this
light coming from? 

Things I HAVE checked. 
1.All planes are in contact along all edges. 
2.All windows have their surface normals pointing 
inwards. 
3.Double and triple checked (multiple runs with same
results) each of these simulations.

I am a new user so my use of the Command Prompt to do
most of this is limited. Any suggestions would be
greatly appreciated, though.


Caroline

Hi Caroline,

Thanks for posting your input and images.  The mostly likely cause of 
your problems is that you left rad to set the default value for -av, 
which is based on your exposure.  Since you use the -2 option to pfilt, 
you don't see the effect this exposure setting has on your image, 
therefore you don't realize that it is probably too high.  You need to 
either manually set the -av value in your render= line, or figure out 
what the correct exposure should be for your scene and use that in your 
EXPOSURE= setting.  Then, the light should be better balanced.

A lot of people set -av 0 0 0 as a matter of course in their 
daylighting simulations.  Although such a conservative setting is 
guaranteed to underestimate your lighting levels, it is often better 
than ending up with too much light where it does not belong, like you 
are seeing here.  At least you noticed it!

The Unix version of radiance comes with a script called compamb that 
automatically determines an appropriate ambient value (and exposure) 
given a rad input file.  I don't believe this is included in 
DesktopRadiance, but you can look for it.

Good luck!
-Greg

Hi Caroline,

I can think of three possible things that you might want to look into:

   1. Illums - these are imposter geometry to help optimize daylight
      simulation in interior environments. I see that you have the
      illum= line in the rif file, however since you are getting the
      warning about "no lights found" it is likely that there is some
      problem: A) illum geometry is directionally dependant, the surface
      normal must point into the room. To create a polygon in Autocad
      with the normal pointing into the room, the polygon (a closed
      pline or 3dface for example) can be constructed by generating
      vertices in a counter clockwise manner, for example if the polygon
      is built in the xy plane then drawing it counter clockwise would
      result in a normal that point in positive z. B) I do not use the
      rad program so I am not so sure about this, but does the geometry
      that appears in the illum= line also need to apear in the scene= line?
   2. Ambient value - this allows a baseline ambient value to be
      established for the scene, this can be estimated or precalculated
      with a different script (although I am not sure how DR deals with
      this). If this value is too high then the images can have the kind
      of "glowy" appearance. I am guessing that a default value is being
      used from the information in the rif file. This may need to
      estimated by hand for best results.
   3. Indirect - this indicates how many ambient bounces to calculate.
      If you are after accurate results this number probably needs to be
      2 and perhaps more depending on other factors.

Quite Hazardous! :)

I did get it to work, although not quite the way you suggested.  Not
sure what the problem is with Cygwin & rad, but I almost always get a
core dump when rad tries to oconv something big.  Therefore I needed to
get around this problem as well as I was getting tired of manually
oconving after each core dump...  (BTW, it's been great having Cygwin as
an option for running radiance on a Windows system)

The one problem I'm still having (not really a problem) is that I can't
get mkillum to generate all of its *.dat files in the illums folder. 
This is making it harder to keep everything nice and clean since I end
up with 82 files for every run and there are 53 runs!  Best I can do to
clean this up is to remove the old *.dat files before I begin the next
mkillum process.

Also, I can't quite settle on the best looking view..  But I don't
expect much help there!

My final octree generator looks as follows.  Basically I pulled the
light sources and octree updating from rad.  This eliminated both of my
problems.  We'll see how long this takes with all the variables set to
high.....

frame=$1
time=`ev "5.25+($frame/4)"`
gensky 3 21 $time +s -a 38.7 -o 90.5 -m 90 > sun.rad
oconv -f -i ./octree/lobby_b.oct sun.rad sky.rad >
./octree/lobby_b0.oct
rm *.dat
mkillum @anim1/render.opt ./octree/lobby_b0.oct "<" ./scene/illums.rad
> ./illums/processedillums.rad
oconv -f -i ./octree/lobby_b0.oct ./illums/processedillums.rad

Greg, thanks for the hand.

Hi Mark,

I'm not quite sure what to suggest about the core dump -- I found out 
on another project that Cygwin isn't all that good with memory use.

As for mkillum creating extra *.dat files, you need to set the f= 
option as explained in the man page to avoid this behavior.

Great! Thanks for the suggestions. Indeed it seems as
though -av will fix this. Next step is to try this on
my larger simulations.
An additional questions, as I am not too experienced
with this application:

As my primary use of Desktop Radiance centres on the
changes in daylighting in a building as the glazing
type changes, should I expect to need a different -av
setting for each variation of the design? What is
likely to be the greatest factor in setting my -av
number - does it sound reasonable that for the same
buidling geometry, I will probably find the same -av
setting works throughout all glazing variations? Or
will it be the date/time/location setting which is the
biggest player? or something else? 

...or should I just plan for this to take several
tests of -av settings for each and every glazing
variation?

Cheers,
Caroline

As a principle, yes. Each variation will result in a
different "general illumination level", which is what
-av more or less represents.

If the primary variable is the transmittance of the
glazing, then you can probably just scale -av linearly
with that. If there are other modifications involved,
you might still need to start experimenting from there.

Hi Caroline,

If you are changing all the glazing at once, you can simply scale the 
-av parameter value by the transmittance of your glazings and that will 
give you the correct relative changes.  In fact, excepting for angular 
variations in transmittance, you could scale your entire result under 
those circumstances.

I've found that Radiance on Cygwin is great for learning and for 
setting up your Rad's and Rifs. But when I got to do a large 
rendering, I then hand it over to a G4 Mac (since I don't have a Linux 
box anymore). It's just been wonderful for learning, but I too have 
had the segfaults sometimes when dealing with large RAD files. I've 
taken to exporting my models from Revit to AutoCAD then using a LISP 
routine to then export each layer out to a separate RAD file to try to 
get around this, and it works pretty well.

How is the speed with VMWare? I'd love to use it rather than trying to 
make my laptop a dual-boot, however I do a lot of heavy 3D and need 
whatever speed I can get sometimes...

Thanks!

	I use vmware on my laptop (1.7GHz, 512MB RAM) and on the 3GHz office PC. There is no slowdown - the speed is the same as if you would run it on native Linux/Unix. The setup on laptops is no problem whatsoever. vmware recognizes the graphics card automatically. Heavy 3D doesn't need more than 150 MB RAM, so I run Photoshop and Radiance even on the laptop at the same time. Actually, I use vmware more than Linux dualboot on the office PC, because you always need some microsoft programs.

Thanks for the tip! Wow I'll have to look more into this, for the 
CAD/3D/BIM program I use in Windows-only, but I use a couple of things 
on the Linux side too. Being able to run both at the same time would 
be very keen.

Thanks!

OK, so I've got this idea to make a Radiance Render server. Basically 
it will be a computer that sits in my closet, running Linux, that I 
can e-mail it a render job and have it e-mail back the finished images.

First off: Before I replicate a bunch of work, is there already 
something like this out there available? I know that Design Workshop 
has a render server available via a web form.

Second off: Would it even be feasible to use e-mail as the way to 
submit and receive jobs? The jobs would probably be rather large, so I 
guess I'll have to figure something out. Just seems very simple to 
make some programs that would take an e-mail and run with it than to 
have to build a web front end or something...

Thanks for any input,

I usually try not to advertise here, but if you ask... ;)

Rayfront has a server component, which makes it possible to
send jobs to other machines on the local network. At the
moment, the user needs to control that manually, but I'm
working on queueing and load distribution functionality.

Client and server need access to the same disk space,
I don't think that using e-mail scales well enough.

If the server(farm) was offsite (which Rayfront doesn't
allow for reasons of security), other transport mechanisms
would become necessary. Actually, a simple scp might
do the trick.

The DW form is the only thing I've seen publicly too.

Well, it depends on what you need back.  The really large files tend to 
be the octrees, the ambient cache files, and the Radiance pics, which 
all get generated from your rad files which are relatively small.  Could 
you make do with jpeg versions of the images?  They'd be much smaller 
than the 32 bit Radiance images.  You could create a script that would 
take your uploaded .rad files (and maybe a rif file), runs the 
simulation, converts the pics to jpeg, and emails 'em back to you (or 
generates some html so that you could view the images online).  All the 
bulk of the simulation would still be on the RRS (Radiance Render 
Server).  Maybe the script could pack up the simulation as a tar.gz 
archive and a link to download the file could be added to the image html 
page; this would get around any email file size limits too.

Notice how there are no practical code samples here.  I'm good with the 
ideas, but not with the programming. =8-)  Keep us posted on your 
progress though!

if you want my arogant two-cent thoughts after some years of IT life: 
the only reason for doing it by email is what the name of your domain 
says: becausewecan.org

   1. You'll be moving a couple of dozen megabytes for any serious work,
      email gateways typically block very large emails, not to mention
      folks with slow links. A sysadmin may rip out vital parts out of
      someone using the system mail spool area as intermediate
      octree/image storage.  ftp/http/scp is just better by design for
      large volume
   2. the server has to set up everything the specific job needs
      (version of binaries, environment variables, libraries, ...),
      which needs a bit of care with any method
   3. web-based leaps to mind before email does (the latter probably
      never leaps anyway...). Marc Fontoynont's group sat up something
      for their Genelux program long ago (sorry, don't have any further
      references to it)
   4. how do your users pack their jobs ? zip,tar ? How do they verify
      they have everything included ?
   5. why setting up a server anyway? For an occasoanl user the various
      boot-radiance-from-cd concepts are probably much quicker (right on
      their machine), for bulk processing a render farm with file
      sharing is approx 3 orders of magnitude faster and easier to manage
   6. for public usage the server would have to implement some resource
      management, otherwise any job may block the resources for an
      unpredictable time

if you still want to go and dig in (good!), my personal recommendation 
would be PHP scripts on a webserver (very preferably Apache). Actually I 
thought about it years ago at ISE, but just hadn't found a good reason 
to offer it publicly. Internally we used our own job distribution system 
(based on NFS) at ISE.

Dont ask me why I didn't mention this an hour ago.

Probably because I'm still more thinking of it as a project
than a product. But I've been working on a web based online
version of Rayfront for quite a while now. It's in beta, and
the payment infrastructure is currently being integrated.

The people who commissioned this will offer it as a service,
or sell it as a "render appliance". You can buy a box to be
installed in a rack in your server room, and all you need
to access it for running simulations is a web browser with
the flash plugin.

Upload a DXF file, compressed with zip or gzip if it
gets too large otherwise. Other types of upload will be
easy to add if there's a real need.

How about a render farm in behind a server based interface?
Those boot-radiance-from-cd concepts also don't come with
tools for material assignment and simulation control

The available CPUs need to be adequate for the expecded
load. In an in-house situation, you just file jobs into a
queue. On a commercial service you can buy "render points",
some of which get eaten up by each simulation you run.
Other than that you have user and group management, so that
several people from the same organisation can run their jobs
and it all gets billed together.

Buzzword alarm:
The online version of Rayfront is a multi-tier solution.
It uses the Python-based web application server Zope running
behind Apache, with XML-RPC connections to the Flash client and
to the simulation backend.

A: I was thinking that this would be a part of the solution, a .zip or 
.tar file is sent to the 'RRS' (thanks for that) and then it's 
unpacked, and any user-defined .cal's and such will be included within 
that archive. The basic assumption is that everyone using this (which 
would be my company, which right now consists of me ;-) ) would be on 
the same page, Radiance-wise.

Web stuff and FTP are all well and good, and a great way to go, if I 
want to pay extra for a static IP and the task of managing my own 
server. I'm mobile, working from a laptop, and while I can run stuff 
under Cygwin (and do) it would be cooler/better/more feasible to have 
the RRS do this while I'm working on something else and/or in transit.

>   4. how do your users pack their jobs ? zip,tar ? How do they verify
>      they have everything included ?

I've got a flowchart that I worked out, that makes it e-mail back 
error messages if something is left out or if there is an error.

Two things: When rendering, I would like to work on my computer for 
other things too, and those other things require Windows. Currently I 
run Cygwin on my laptop, and use Radiance within there. This is 
working well, but I would love to be able to hand these jobs off to a 
faster computer, and a desktop/server gives a lot more bang for the 
buck than a laptop in raw processor speed. It would also allow for the 
RRS to run whatever OS is best on whatever hardware I can afford, and 
then I can move the RRS to whatever platform I need, or in the future 
to a cluster...

Second is that it would be cool. No, Seriously. I work in Revit, dump 
my models to AutoCAD, tweak layers and such, export to Radiance, send 
the job off, and then keep working in Revit while my job 'bakes' on 
the RRS and is sent back to me when done. How cool would that be? My 
little RRS working away, day and night... Makes animations much more 
feasible too!

This would primarily be for my own use, so I'm gonna start out small.

Yeah, if I go with a web-thing it would probably be Apache on 
Mandrake, using Python (just because it's what I'm a little familiar 
with) or something.

Thanks again, keep it coming!

Hi,

I'm new to Radiance and this list. I am trying to create some sort of

Mist.

I have tried experimenting with Mist and Trans, both with limited
success. Does anyone have any advice about how to achieve a realistic

Message-ID: <200404252017.QAA12644@webmail11.cac.psu.edu>

Hi, This is woogie.

I am trying to study material characteristic in Radiance by using Desktop
Radiance in the DOS mode.

I have some problems with glow and spotlight material.

I made a simple scene with only two surfaces facing each other.
One of surfaces is light source and the other is plastic.
the plastic surface (1x1m) is 5m apart from the light source material(1x1m)

And I plugged in different light source material to see if there is differernt.

Light and illum material result in the same illuminance value as that by hand
calcuation.

When it comes to glow material, it seems to me odd.
The first, It is said that the fourth argument, maxrad in the glow material can
be negative, zero, and positive. 

When the fourth argument is zero, illuminance value on the floor(1x1m) which is
5m apart from the glow material(1x1) is not uniform.

Light amd illum material result in the uniform illuminance value on the floor
with the same geometry material setting.

It seems to me that rendering parameter might not correct because the center of
the floor is darker than the edge of the floor or it comes from Desktop
Radiance or it is because I did not understand the fourth argument in the glow
material.

If anyone knows of my problem, please let me know.

Subject: [Radiance-general] .oct-instances, overlapping octrees?
Message-ID: <00D27D7A-976B-11D8-AC4B-000A959DDB22@gmx.net>

Hi list.

I have a question regarding the useage of octrees as instances. Are 
problems experienced when the bounding boxes of instances overlap, or 
only if the actual geometry contained in the instances overlap.

E.g. if I have one hollow cube (instance1) and one small cube 
(instance2) inside instance1, the bounding boxes overlap, while the 
geometry doesn't conflict (because instance1 is like an empty room, 
instance2 like a piece of furniture). Should I expect problems in such 
configurations?

The reason for my question is that I am "atomizing" a huge model into 
small objects, which will be instances placed by markers. The objects' 
geometries will all fit nicely and won't overlap, but of course a lot 
of the octrees' bounding boxes will overlap, and I am a bit worried if 
this concept will make trouble later...

Greg Ward wrote in a reply to my ideas about geometrical structured 
surfaces some time ago:
"If we were to minimize code changes, we'd be using instances of some 
kind with clipping, and we'd end up with a lot of overlapping 
suboctrees.  Many on this list can tell you their headaches surrounding 
those if you haven't had enough of your own.  Getting tighter bounds on 
the instanced geometry would require some rather fundamental changes to 
the handling of octrees, and still wouldn't completely remedy the 
problems with side-by-side instances.  They just don't work that well."


TIA+CU Lars.

The fourth argument can be set to 0. It is important to crank up the rpict ambient calulcation or you will miss the glow source, because it can only be caught by -ad and -as rays

Hi Woogie,

What you are seeing is likely the result of a known anomaly in the 
hemispherical sampling pattern used by the indirect calculation in 
Radiance.  I think Charles Ehrlich was the first to point this out to 
me -- the polar sampling I use on the hemisphere means that the exact 
pole is never sampled, and there is a slight dip in the response to 
indirect surfaces directly overhead as a result.  Since this is how you 
arranged your scene, it is likely that this is the source of the odd 
dip in value towards the center of the surface illuminated by the glow 
source, as the glow only contributes to the indirect portion of 
illuminance.

To fix this problem would complicate the code and only reduce errors in 
some very odd circumstances.  There are many other circumstances that 
cause similar biases, so I never thought it worthwhile to change it.

-Greg

Ive not done any work on that specific period, but I tried to tackle
this problem in my medieval abbey reconstruction of stained glass. 
I found that for internal views of the glass the material glass was
best, as it could be textured and propagated the light well into the
room. As for external rendering, the glass was far too reflective,
almost like a mirror , therefore I used trans. Have a play with the
settings for it, the reflectivity can be adjusted etc, but I found it
difficult to get the same internal lighting quality with trans.

Hi John,

of course I watched your thread. In my model, the situation is a bit 
different. I don't care about exterior appearance, the windows are 
mainly light sources. However, as I am working on a model of a real 
building, I don't want to create a glass material just by guessing, and 
I am currently searching for e.g. measured data of glasses as used in 
that time. However... as almost all the light goes through these 
windows, the values of transmissivity and color will only change the 
numeric results, not the perceived appearance, right? So it is not that 
dangerous ;-)

Thank you + CU, Lars.

Hi all,

Just wanted to announce that today, I received a copy of the revised 
version of Rendering with Radiance.

It is paperback, has no color plates, and does not include the original 
cd, but, it has been revised, apparently to more accurately reflect 
some of the changes and updates to Radiance since the 1st edition was 
published in 1998.

I found it through bn.com, but the actual dealer is BookSurge.  The 
price, with shipping was about $38.

hi,
I managed to compile it on a powerbook 1.25 G4
so the answer  it's: yes it works!
my system has:
10.3.3 panther
radiance 3.5 binaries
pmap 3.28


the way I did it is:

download the archives from
http://www.ise.fhg.de/alt-aber-aktiv/radiance/photon-map/download.html

put all the archives .tar.gz in the same new directory called Test ( just a
name.. )

you decompress radiance archive (rad3R5.tar.gz) in the directory Test with
tar -xvf rad3R5.tar.gz

then there should be a new directory called ray inside Test. (I do this way
because stuffit doesn't work...)

now from the same location, inside Test, type 
tar -xvf pmap-3.28.tar.gz

you should have only two .gz file and a ray directory....


now:


1 - go into ray

2 - type ./makeall install from ray

3 - select the text editor you like (pico it's my preferred)

4 - select a directory for the compiled binaries like ~/Desktop/bin (must be
created before; be carefull with permission)

5 - choose 7th option (macosX)

6 - select the library location (be carefull with permission)

7 - select your options by editing the file, if you dare ;-)) (I use
defaults...)


should be ok....

cheers,
giulio


PS sometimes I use this optimisation with G4 and radiance (not with pmap):
(you get up to 30% more)
 -fast -mcpu=7450
but could be a little buggy sometimes....

Subject: RE: [Radiance-general] photon-mapping on the macintosh


hi,
I managed to compile it on a powerbook 1.25 G4
so the answer  it's: yes it works!
my system has:
10.3.3 panther
radiance 3.5 binaries
pmap 3.28


the way I did it is:

download the archives from
http://www.ise.fhg.de/alt-aber-aktiv/radiance/photon-map/download.html

put all the archives .tar.gz in the same new directory called Test ( just a
name.. )

you decompress radiance archive (rad3R5.tar.gz) in the directory Test with
tar -xvf rad3R5.tar.gz

then there should be a new directory called ray inside Test. (I do this way
because stuffit doesn't work...)

now from the same location, inside Test, type 
tar -xvf pmap-3.28.tar.gz

you should have only two .gz file and a ray directory....


now:


1 - go into ray

2 - type ./makeall install from ray

3 - select the text editor you like (pico it's my preferred)

4 - select a directory for the compiled binaries like ~/Desktop/bin (must be
created before; be carefull with permission)

5 - choose 7th option (macosX)

6 - select the library location (be carefull with permission)

7 - select your options by editing the file, if you dare ;-)) (I use
defaults...)


should be ok....

cheers,
giulio


PS sometimes I use this optimisation with G4 and radiance (not with pmap):
(you get up to 30% more)
 -fast -mcpu=7450
but could be a little buggy sometimes....

Could somebody with experience with using the photon-mapping extension 
to radiance on a Macintosh please point me to either:
1) if it can be compiled on a Mac (I've been getting too many errors in 
the compile to recount here)
2) if there is a precompiled version available for download

Thanks.

That's great news the book's finally available!  This is the first I've 
heard of it.

I just wanted to add a note regarding the "revised" version in the 
title.  Not much was actually changed from the first edition, since we 
didn't have time (or thought we didn't a year ago when we started this 
process) to add any new chapters, which is what we'd really need to do. 
  Plus, we were restricted to working with the PDF from Morgan Kaufmann, 
since the originals were all lost.  All we did was fix a few typos and 
formulas, since the opportunity presented itself.

While it is indeed great that the book is available again for a
reasonable price, the ordering process is slightly suboptimal.
Whoever has a direct communication channel to booksurge might
want to provide them some feedback: Asking for the buyers name
and phone number etc, before informing them about the total
costs (incl. shipping) is extremely bad style. You only need
the country for that, no personally identifiable data.

Forwarded message from Charles Ehrlich <ehrlich@h-m-g.com>:

BookSurge is in the midst of a web site revamp.  I have given loads of
advice about their lousy interface.  The whole problem with the e-book
being accidentally released was because their author's ordering website
is suboptimal.

There are other book outlets (amazon.com) that should be able to order
the book in a few weeks.

Yeehaw!

I just checked and it says it's $60 now!  I didn't
realize it was an auction site. :-)

Sigh.  The price was for a paperback edition, which we did not 
authorize, at a price we did not authorize.  BookSurge has made a 
number of screw-ups, this being the most recent.  Since they did not 
send us an author's copy as we requested or let us know when they were 
making the book available as we requested, we only found out from 
John's e-mail that it was for sale.  Chas contacted them and corrected 
the situation, hence the price change.  (Technically, this is not an 
"increase" because we never suggested the price they quoted.)  Perhaps 
you recall that earlier, they put the PDF up for sale against our 
wishes, and that was also caught by an astute user.

I am sorry for the price change, but we did not intend to offer a 
paperback version, and we would have to redo the cover (again) to make 
it work.  Given the wear and tear we expect most people to get out of 
it, we thought a hard cover was preferable.  The higher cost also 
reflects the overhead of on-demand printing, I think.  Chas could tell 
you more, and you should contact him if you wish to make any bulk 
purchases.

Hello,

Just a quick query about generating windows in Optics5.  I have created a simple double glazed
configuration of two 6mm layers of generic clear glass (the system is therefore symetrical i.e.
optical properties are congruent for front and back).  The export as a rad file (named 'roofglass')
creates a glass material and 2 brtdf materials (for front and back).  Which should I use, the
glass, or one of the BRTDFs?  They return slightly differing results.  Is there a way of combining
the all 3 somehow to get one BRTDF that covers front and back (and which is front and back anyway,
front outside, back inside, assuming surface normals have been oriented inwards??).  The rad file
looks like this;

#
# FileName= GlzSys.usr
# Product Name= 
# NFRC ID= 30000
# Manufacturer Name= User
# Glazing Type= Glazing system
# Coated Side= Neither
# Transmittance= 0.785
# Front Reflectance= 0.144
# Back Reflectance= 0.144
# Thickness(mm)= 23.430
# Appearance=

Ah...thanks for the explanation. 

I agree a hardcover is preferable and worth the extra $.

Subject: [Radiance-general] rtrace for luminance values
Message-ID: <4CABBBB9-9AE5-11D8-B043-000A95871DF2@mac.com>

I have run into a problem that I think Mehlika Nur Inanici had a couple 
of year's back.

I am trying to use rtrace to get luminance values on top of a desk 
surface.  The command I'm using is:

cnt 6 12 1 | rcalc -e '$1=51+((72/6)*$1+6);$2=96+((144/12)*$2+6);$3=30' 
\
-e '$4=0;$5=0;$6=1' | rtrace -h -ov @../options_aa08_ab5 -af 
b_b_m_2_bare_aa08_ad1024_ab5.amb -e 
b_b_m_2_bare_illumgrid_task_08_l.out b_b_m.oct \
| rcalc -e '$1=179*(.265*$1+.670*$2+.065*$3)' > 
b_b_m_2_bare_illumgrid_task_08_l.dat

The values reported by rtrace are in the range of 0.1 to 0.2 
candela/meter squared.  However, in an image, I am getting values in 
the range of 1.5 to 2.5 candela/meter squared (which is much more 
reasonable).

In response to Mehlika's question, Schorsch had mentioned that the 
header to the pic file would give an exposure value, and that luminance 
= 179*(.265*R+.670*G+.065*B) / e.  But I can't seem to find the 
exposure.

What am I missing?  Where am I not looking?

Thanks.

Hello John. You can use the getinfo command to look at the exposure of 
an Radiance image. The exposure value is given as EXPOSURE=.... If there 
is no exposure line, exposure is 1.00 by default.
Hope it helps...
