Hello Greg,

Thank you for your reply. Unfortunately I`m short of time, so if  
possible I would like to see your scripts, thank you.
I`ve also uploaded a couple of (very noisy) images that I`m getting.  
Probably this is because I`m not using the right scripts, but just as  
an illustration.
The images are in:

Hi Santiago,

I wish I could offer you some words of encouragement, because I
appreciate the difficulty you face applying rtcontrib to daylight
coefficients.  The truth is, you really need some scripts to help out
with the task, and I haven't yet had a chance to write a general set
of scripts or an executive program for DC analysis.  I am working on
this project currently, as a matter of fact.

All I have at this point is a few test scripts I assembled for a
daylight simulation study, and I can make these available for you if
you need an early start on this.  If you can wait a few weeks, I will
have something much better, I hope.

Just to answer your question, adding together the rtcontrib outputs
directly gives you the result for a uniform sky.  To get a particular
sky, you must multiply each image by the average radiance of the
corresponding sky patch.  To compute this, a simple rtrace
calculation using the desired sky model and a set of randomly
distributed rays over the hemisphere will do the trick.  Such a set
of rays is given in the file "ray/lib/tregsamp.dat", where there are
64 rays per sky patch.  The command to compute pcomb arguments from
this file is:

rtrace -h skymodel.oct < tregsamp.dat \
         | total -64 -m \
         | rcalc -o '-s ${$2} c_${recno-1}.pic'

I realize this is just a clue, but if you wait a few weeks, hopefully
I can provide a complete solution.

Hi Santiago,

I am sending you the scripts in a separate message, as I don't really  
want to share these with the whole mailing list.  My intention is to  
replace them with something more general and robust in the coming  
weeks, and I don't want to create a lot of confusion beforehand.

The noise you are seeing can be reduced with different parameter  
settings or high resolution sampling, but it will never go away.   
Rtcontrib, unlike rtrace and the other Radiance tools, produces an  
unbiased Monte Carlo sampling, which shows variance (noise) which is  
an honest estimate of the uncertainty at each pixel.  You can try  
running it through a noise reduction filter if you find it offensive,  
but we can't use the irradiance interpolation algorithm with rtcontrib.

Hello Greg,

Thank you for the explanation. I will try with different settings,  
but I feel better now. First I though I was using rtcontrib in a  
wrong way (now I realize I had tried with very low settings). Sorry  
for the confusion.
Best regards,

Subject: [Radiance-general] glazing modelling 
Message-ID: <004f01c5dfa3$144f93f0$0100a8c0@mallah>

Hi,
I have few questions about accurate modeling of different glazing. I've read 
all previous discussions on this list, and now I'll try to summarize my 
thoughts about this subject.
Suppose we want to simulate the behavior of some single or multiple layer 
glazing in Radiance, and the data of available glazings can be found in 
Optics5 database (actually IGDB).
These are few possible procedures how to define and use this material:

PROCEDURE1
1. convert glazing (all layers) data from Optics5 to Radiance.
2. use output glass material for glazing definition.

Problem:
*Glass reflectance is calculated implicitly, and values from Optic5 database 
don't have any effect.
This can be solved by using trans.cal functional file, and changing index of 
refraction to obtain appropriate reflectance.
*Dependence between light incident angle and transmittance/reflectance is 
implicit and it is calculated using the algorithm for common glass material.

PROCEDURE 2:
1. convert glazing (all layers) data from Optics5 to Radiance.
2. adjust BRTDfunc data, like Jack de Valpine suggested:
void BRTDfunc GlzSys_front_and_back
10
    if(Rdot, <r_front_refl>, <r_back_ref>l) if(Rdot, <g_front_refl>, 
<g_back_refl>) if(Rdot, <b_front_refl>, <b_back_refl>)
    <r_trans> <g_trans> <b_trans>
    0   0   0
    .
0
9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
3.Use this BRTD definition for glazing.

Problem:
*No transmittance/reflectance dependence of incident angle is taken into 
account!

PROCEDURE 3:
1.convert glazing (all layers) data from Optics5 to Radiance.
2.Use BRTD definition and glazing.cal file to define angular dependence of 
transmittance/reflectance values.  Definition would look like:
mod BRTDfunc my_glazing
10     rrho grho brho
        rtau gtau btau
        0 0 0
        glazing.cal
0
18     0 0 0
        0 0 0
        0 0 0
        FRRHO FGRHO FBRHO
        BRRHO BGRHO BBRHO
        RTAU GTAU BTAU
where:
    FRRHO FGRHO FBRHO is front normal spectral reflectance
    BRRHO BGRHO BBRHO is back normal spectral reflectance
    RTAU GTAU BTAU is normal spectral transmittance

3.Use this definition for glazing material.

Problem:
*glazing.cal calculate these functions ONLY for coated and clear glass with 
the cut- off point transmittance=0.654. Below that value it is supposed that 
glass is coated, and above that it is clear.

PROCEDURE 4:
1.convert each layer of glazing  from Optics5 to Radiance.
2.Create input file for glaze.csh script (see question below)
3.Call glaze.csh script and define 1 or 2 panel glazing, and all its 
surfaces.
4.Use BRDTfunc created as output of the script, as glazing material.

Problem/question:
*Is it important what kind of glazing user defines? I know the main goal of 
this script is to define fritted glass, but is the calculation OK for user 
defined types of surface.


QUESTIONS:
1.Which of this procedures should be used in which real case? I suppose for 
single pane clear glass we could use only glass primitive. Can glazing.cal 
be used for all coated glazings, and glaze.csh for fritted ones?
2.What is the format of input file for glaze.csh script?
3.What if glazing have more than 2 layers?

Thanks,
Marija.

Hi Marija,

This is a good summary here with a lot of questions. I am not sure that 
I can answer all of the questions, I will try to address a few items though

As I read "trans.cal" this is for converting from transmittance to 
transmissivity, the latter value is used for the radiance "glass" 
material type. I believe that the "glass" material that is output from 
Optics accounts for this translation. I think that maybe Chas Erhlich 
could confirm this?

Note though, quoting Greg from the file, that trans.cal is for an 
"infinite series solution for an uncoated pane of glass." This is a 
solution for a single pane only. I am not sure that adjusting the index 
of refraction is a valid way to "adjust" the reflectance and it still 
would result on the same reflectance on both sides of the material. Most 
glass systems that use coated glass have different reflectances on the 
outside and inside.

This is just a hack to combine the two separate BRTDfunc definitions 
output from Optics into one definition. You correctly note the problem 
with this hack.

I think that another important issue with this is that it is really 
accounts for only one type of coating and I do not think that it 
accounts for multi-pane assemblies.

Actually, I think that at the time we were interested both in coated and 
frit glass, multi-pane assemblies, so I would not say the main goal of 
the script if frit glass only. However I am not sure what you mean by 
your question: "is it important what kind of glazing user defines?" Yes, 
you need to correctly assemble a glazing system in Optics, and export 
each individual layer (up to two panes). I think that one can obtain 
100% coverage reflectances/transmittance for frit glass if you talk with 
the manufacturer. The other thing that is important is the orientation 
of the geometry that the material is applied to, the normal needs to 
point into the space. Note also that while the material may represent a 
multisurface piece of real world geometry, the representation in 
Radiance is a single surface piece of geometry.

If you are going to use this script I highly recommend that you export 
your own data and use the -f option of the script so you can use a data 
file that defines your own coated glass and frit glass (if needed) options.

For frit glazing systems, one problem with this script is that it cannot 
account for systems where the frit and coating are on the same surface. 
Also currently the scrip depends on the "clear" glass data hard wired 
into the script.

I think that the short answer is that glazing.cal does not account for 
all coated glazing and is only for a single pane glazing system. 
Glaze.csh is currently the only thing that creates some opportunity to 
use data from something like Optics in a more functional way. Glaze.csh 
is not only for fritted glass.

> 2.What is the format of input file for glaze.csh script?

The input file should look something like the following it has a header 
line followed by one line per glazing material type:

Surface   Tr   Tg   Tb   Rcr   Rcg   Rcb   Rgr   Rgg   Rgb   Part
<surface name>   <r trans>   <g trans>   <b trans>   <r coated refl>   
<g coated refl>   <b coated refl>   <r glass side refl>   <g glass side 
refl>   <b glass side refl>   <boolean switch [0 or 1] to indicate if 
material can have partial coverage, such as a frit>

As I recall this file is pretty sensitive to spacing of the values!

> 3.What if glazing have more than 2 layers?

You should contract Greg to extend the script to account for more layers...!

Hi Jack,
Thank you for the fast answer.
 I just have few comments:

Yes, this conversion is taken into account when glazing is exported.
I meant trans2.cal, not trans.cal. My idea was to use a trick I've found in
some Greg's mail:
To define glass with transmittance .85 and reflectance 0.5, run "calc
trans2.cal" in the ray/src/cal/cal directory and enter:
       Tn = 0.85
       Rn = 0.05
Typing in "n" and "tn" will give you these results:
       n
       $1=1.39992615
       tn
       $2=0.894736842

You are right, so I suppose this 'simply glass' option is definitely not for
use.

Yes, I've already had that problem, and that is the reason why I've asked
for the format definition.
The other problem occurs when I put only one glazing definition into the
file. Glaze script doesn't report error, but new material isn't added to
list of available surfaces!? Do you have an idea why it is happening?

Thanks again,
marija

I have attached a file that should (highly dependent on non-munging by 
email) contain the correct spacing of the header portion of the file. 
The data needs to have the same spacing.

I suspect the problem with the (1) definition is that you do not have 
the header in the file or the file is not correctly formated.

Make sure you have a final end-of-line character in your file.  A lot  
of editors don't bother with it, but most Unix utiliities require a  
final EOL (linefeed).  I checked the script, and I think this is the  
most likely problem.

Regarding more than two layers, the math gets exponentially more  
complicated with each layer, so I'm not likely to  add capability in  
this area any time soon....

Thanks Jack and Greg.
 Header was OK, but I suppose the end-of-line was the problem!

OK. My question was more hypothetically.

Hi,

what does this error message mean, and by what can it be caused? Is it 
possible that using inproper oconv parameters results in "zero ray 
direction in localhit"?

TIA+CU Lars.

Hi Lars,

This is one of those errors that's never supposed to happen, no  
matter what input you give to Radiance or how you set the parameters,  
and indicates either a bug in the code or corruption on its input  
(e.g., a messed up octree).  I don't know what is causing the problem  
in your case, but you could try sending me your scene (to me not to  
the group) and I can have a look.

Hello everyone:
  Sorry to bother you,but I have met a problem and I hope that you can help me.
  I am learning Adeline/Radiance. I have written a program(attached
files)  following the Radiance Tutorial section in Radiance User's
Manual. However, I couldn't get the image. Adeline/Radiance was run
under Windows XP system in my computer. I don't know where is the
problem,maybe you can help me.

Best regards

Subject: [Radiance-general] Photometric data for car headlights
Message-ID: <E1EbWSK-0003Yz-00@noir.ihug.com.au>

Hi all.  I have a situation where I want to analyse typical spill lighting from 
cars on a road.  I will be comparing the spill light and potential glare from 
car headlights before and after proposed road changes.

The trouble is that photometric data for car headlights does not appear to be 
as readily available as commercial interior/exterior lighting files are.  The 
only data I have so far is the sample .rad files for Highbeam and Lowbeam 
lights as used in the road lighting examples in "Rendering with Radiance".  As 
I will be doing analysis in Radiance and other packages, I really need IES 
files for typical headlights

So, my question is, does anyone have any photometric data (IES files) for car 
headlights of any sort?  Or, if not, does anyone have any suggestions for where 
I might be able to find some?  I am primarily concerned with the standard 
headlights (ie. dipped beam, not high beam).

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Richard

One of my student found that she can make HDR Radiance images in Photoshop V9. She did not yet check the accuracy of those:
 
In Photoshop you can Automate --> Merge HDR Photo

            Then you select the photos and before it merges them it asks for exposure speed and f-stop values. 

            You then press Okay and it will compile them.

            Then you have to check the White placement level and press Okay

            When its finished doing all that you go to "save as" a Radiance file

This will give you an HDR format which needs to been processed by Radiance to get a Falsecolor map and luminance ratios.

Photoshop does indeed offer this capability.  Unfortunately, it  
doesn't do any absolute calibration on the images, and the camera  
response it derives is terribly inaccurate.  You are much better off  
with HDRshop from <www.debevec.org>.  The one advantage is that  
Photoshop will align the images if you're starting from hand-held  
exposures.  It doesn't work quite as well or nearly as quickly as  
Photosphere or hdrgen, but at least it's available for Windows.

Hello all,

I recently installed radiance on my Ubuntu machine and am now having 
some problems with rpict. I get the error: rpict: fatal - cannot find 
function file "rayinit.cal." I searched through the mailing list 
archives and found a few items on the placement of library files and 
setting path variables, but nothing I've done has worked. Currently I 
have my library files in /usr/local/lib/ray, and I checked to make sure 
that rayinit.cal is indeed in there (it is). The path variables are 
exporting properly as I can see the paths when I "echo $PATH" and "echo 
$RAYPATH," however rpict is still not finding rayinit.cal for some 
reason. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Dave Maino

Ogg: [Radiance-general] rayinit.cal problems

Hello all,

I recently 
installed radiance on my Ubuntu machine and am now having 
some 
problems with rpict. I get the error: rpict: fatal - cannot find 
function file "rayinit.cal." I searched through the mailing list 
archives and found a few items on the placement of library files and 
setting path variables, but nothing I've done has worked. Currently I 
have my library files in /usr/local/lib/ray, and I checked to make 
sure 
that rayinit.cal is indeed in there (it is). The path variables 
are 
exporting properly as I can see the paths when I "echo $PATH" and 
"echo 
$RAYPATH," however rpict is still not finding rayinit.cal for 
some 
reason. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Dave 
Maino

Message-ID: <437E619E.2080902@rumblestrip.org>

Howdy folks.

Been playing with the new "drape" command in AutoCAD 2006.  This command 
makes it extremely easy to create terrain meshes, and I'm working on a 
project that is located in a valley so I thought it'd be nice to be able 
to model the valley since the mountains provide some considerable 
shading in the morning and afternoons.  But of course now my octree 
bounding box is quite large, which leads me to this ditty from the 
rtrace manpage, regarding the -ar parameter:

*"*The maximum  ambient  value  density  is the scene size times the ambient accuracy 
(see the /-aa/ option below)  divided  by  the ambient  resolution."

By having such an expansive outdoor geometry, am I forcing a very high 
-ar in order to get good data from rtraces in an interior space, or if I 
use enough -ab will this not matter?  A test render looked very flat 
too; I thought it was the mellow settings I used for the test render, 
but now I'm concerned that without -ar's in the thousands (!), my 
renderings will always look very flat.

If your outdoor scene is hundreds of times larger than your indoor  
scene, you are probably better off setting -ar 0 and just suffering  
the long render times in the inside corners.  If the bounding cube is  
less than a hundred times larger than your interior space, then just  
increase your -ar setting by the corresponding factor, or let rad  
figure it out for you.

Setting -ar 0 switches off all interpolation, I guess?  Thanks Greg.  
I'll look at that, or maybe just use the mountain geometry with -ab 0 
and use that model to see how much the shading is working for us.

Hi Rob,

Actually, -ar 0 just turns off the limit to value spacing, so you'll  
basically get one interreflection calculation per pixel on inside  
corners.  Interpolation still takes place when surfaces are farther  
apart.  To turn off interpolation altogether, you'd have to set -aa  
0, which is another (somewhat more drastic) approach to the scaling  
problem.

Hi,

I have downloaded some nice (and very complex)  furniture-geometry from 
the internet that I like to render in Radiance, but when I create an 
octree I get the "set overflow in addobject" error. The -r -and -n 
option do not help.

Is there a way to just skip the 'wrong' geometry (that is causing the 
error) in oconv ?
Any other options (instead of modelling the furniture myself) ?

What do you mean by "the -r option does not work"?  I have had to set -r 
pretty darned high sometimes, to get big models with fine detail to 
compile.  You get a large octree, and it takes a while to generate, but 
it works.  By "pretty darned high", I am talking about -r as high as one 
million.

Hey all,

There are a couple of things here. You should probably try to take a 
look at the geometry and see if there is any extra/duplicate geomery. 
Doubled up geomery can oftern be a cause for a set overflow like this. 
You should be able to control a lot with -r.

Guilio's suggestion is also an excellent one. I have found that I can 
deal with much more complex geometry sets with obj2mesh. And it looks 
like the file size of the rtm is typically smaller than a corresponding 
oct file.

Hi all,

 

Can Radiance be run on computers with multiple processors?  Similarly,
can it be run across multiple machines?  And if so, does one need to do
anything special to make it run?

Hi Nicholas,

There are many ways to run Radiance with multiple processors
and multiple machines. Some programs like rad and rholo have
support for multiple processors (-N option), rpiece can be used
to split a picture into tiles and have them rendered by different
processors or computers over a network (for instance sharing
the scene files with nfs).

Personally, I like to use openmosix with Radiance, and you can
read about my experience in a previous message to this mailing list:

Message-ID: <001201c5ef67$ccd57ba0$0100a8c0@mallah>

Hi,
I am trying to use mkillum program, for window definition, from rad. If I 
understood well I should have 2 lines in .rif file: illum and mkillum.

-illum line
Should the file defined in this line contain both glazing material and 
surface definition or it can contain only one of them?

-mkillum line parameters:
-ab 2 - I suppose this is enough since the environment is clear (no 
obstructions)
-as and -ad can be the default for rtrace
-av - What exactly represents this -av value for mkillum?   How could I 
compute it?  Would the calculation be accurate if this is 0?

I am simulating simple room with a window on the South wall.

If I run compamb with rif file containing this mkillum, would it use the 
illum material data? I am asking this because in the book it said that rad 
would take care for all changes in illum files, but I am not sure if compamb 
would do that too.

Thanks,
Marija

Message-ID: <4383A575.9050902@pab-opto.de>

Dear Nick,

following your question about Radiance on multi-cpu systems:
You've probably found the many postings on radiance-online (search for 
'mosix' or 'parallel'). My two-cent thoughts on this from my experiences 
over the years at an institute (50 Linux machines) and at my office (6 
machines):

    * Having the CPUs on one board is a lot easier than over the network
      dual Pentium or AMDs are easy to get and relatively cheap, quad
      boards are a bit more expensive, but might be worth it if you're
      really digging into it.
      Sharing the scene and ambient data in RAM is build into rpict
      (rather crude and simple, but it works). Both animations and large
      images use the CPUs in parallel. Parametric studies with different
      octrees require multiple copies of the geometry, of course, but I
      haven't found a scene which is limited by RAM yet (typically other
      limits like ambient rendering times, function files, etc. limit
      rendering before that).
      With a few GB of RAM, RAID-1 or RAID-5 disks, a dual power supply
      and an UPS,  the machine constitutes a reliable and fast
      production system.
    * Distributing over the network via NFS works too
      http://www.ise.fhg.de/alt-aber-aktiv/radiance/animation/ shows an
      animation from my Fhg-ISE days and was rendered on the 50 or so
      Linux machines we had at that time. They shared all data via NFS,
      which works, contrary to an apparent common subliminal feeling.
      (well, you have to use nfs-3 and the kernel NFS server on Linux to
      get file locking, which is essential for the sharing of ambient
      data). Distribution across the machines was done by a small but
      effective and failsafe job distribution system I wrote.
      We had tried Open-Mosix, but never used it for productions. The
      main drawback in my view is that the process 'swims' between
      non-homogeneous machines and this adds an extra layer to keep
      track of. E.g. rpict's logfile will not tell where the process has
      run or is running. In case some machine has faulty hardware it
      gets increasingly hard to track, and that's not really what one
      wants or needs when rendering a few thousand images under time
      constraints. Your mileage may vary, maybe folks out there do use
      Mosix happily for production now.
    * PVM (parallel virtual machine) is a library and system to
      distributed parts of a program across machines (MPI, message
      parsing interface is similar, with different concepts). It
      requires modifying the source (as far as I recall from the times
      when porting to LBNL's Cray-T3 had been a pending idea). Carsten
      Bauer ported Radiance to PVM and others checked out MPI/PVM as
      early as 1997 (see
      http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/pub/digest/no_Z/v3n2 and seach for
      PVM).
      If anyone uses an MPI/PVM enhanced Radiance for commercial or
      research grade production I (and others) would be delighted and
      enlighted to hear about.

open to all new facts and insights-
cheers

Hello,

I'm sure everybody has been dying to see another RADIANCE evaluation 
study! Well, here it is. Accepted by the Journal of the Optical Society 
of America, Series A (JOSA A) and available in its final content form 
via JOSA A's pre-publication site 
(http://josaa.osa.org/upcoming_pdf.cfm?id=62891) for everyone to

RADIANCE's use has now spread well beyond the architectural and lighting 
community.

Hi Alexa,

Thanks for sharing this!  I haven't had a chance to read it yet, but  
just glanced at the abstract and summary.  You might find the  
following reference useful as a means to obtain better color accuracy  
without resorting to a spectral calculation:

Hello,

My graduate student and I tested Photosphere for a Nikon 5400. The results are published in the October 2005 LEUKOS Journal of the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America at

http://www.iesna.org/leukos/Volume2/number2.cfm

See a similar text version at
http://www.personal.psu.edu/mum13/photosphere.pdf

Abstract:
High dynamic range imaging is a set of techniques that allows for a far greater dynamic range of exposure than normal digital imaging techniques. The intention is to accurately represent the dynamic range of lighting levels found in real scenes, ranging from direct sunlight to deep shadows. Various software packages have emerged that translate these HDR images into high resolution luminance maps. This paper tests the accuracy of one such package, taking into consideration different Munsell hues, values, and chroma. It investigates the impact of different light spectra, spatial frequency, vignetting, and thermal noise on the accuracy of luminance measurements and determines the potential errors.

Some conclusions:
Vignetting is a minor problem and leads to a falloff in luminance at the image edges of 80% at 28mm focal length. There is virtualy no vignetting for maximum focal length. 

Warm hues have the least error, while cool hues have the largest errors. 

The error also increases with saturation. The error in reflectance increases as the Munsell value decreases.

The error in reflectance for all Munsell colors, irrespective of hue, chroma and saturation, is almost independent of the illuminance level on the target.

Colors with low chroma (chroma=2) have less error than colors with the maximum chroma at the same Munsell value. 

Photosphere with the Nikon 5400 tends to overestimate the luminance for colors with a low value, or darker colors of the same hue and chroma.

The error in reflectance is independent of the spectral power distribution of "normal" (incandescent, all fluorescents from CRI 60-90, and all major HID lamps) lamps, provided that the Nikon's auto white balance is used. (!)

The minimum detail that can be measured reliably has an angular resolution of 0.0574 degrees. Example: Two distinct objects (black and white lines) are closer than 3.2mm, zoom= 116mm, distance to object: 3.35 m. This will lead to a contrast reduction of around 30%. 

Photosphere be used in scenes with materials having low chroma, saturation and warmer hues with minimal error. However, in scenes with cooler hues like blue and green and with hues having high chroma, the combined errors can go as high as 80%, for example in foliage. 

Interiors of buildings and built environments however usually have low chroma and saturation. The errors in such a case would peak at around 20%. This error could be acceptable since a luminance meter also can have an error of around 2-10%. 

Nikon tends to overestimate, whereas Olympus and Canon tend to underestimate (more contrast). 

Low Munsell values (dark greys) cannot be measured reliably. I recommend to stay away from saturated blues and greens. 

Low illuminance levels are not a problem. The Nikon has a thermal noise correction mechanism which is very useful. 

For specific errors for specific Munsell hue, values and chroma, see the paper. 

Greg, you have done a super job with Photosphere!

Message-ID: <7E0B66590000A543B7BFDDA5DF12FBD4083EFE@CJPSYD2.cjp.co.uk>

Hi  all,

 

I'll like to model the effect of light pipes in a two storey building.
These pipes would enter through the roof via a half-dome of glass.  A
highly reflective pipe (approximately 400mm diameter) runs from this
roof to the ground floor's ceiling where it strikes a diffuser and
lights the space below.

 

The obvious way to model this would be a vertical cylinder with a highly
reflective surface inside.  Probably the top surface (where the light
comes in) should be an illum surface.  I'm not sure, however, that this
method would be very efficient or accurate.

 

What's the best way to model these light pipes?  Has anyone done a
similar thing?

 

Cheers,

 

Brett

Brett,

You really need a forward raytracer to model light-pipes.  Do this  
search in Google:

to find the previous discussions on light pipes and related.

I've tried both your suggestions. Helas, it did not work. I can't spot 
the error, so I have to re-model the geometry.

Thanks for your support!

this is an easy, quick and dirty trick, i.e. no cal file are needed.

BTW you will need to change coefficients for Px and Py as needed...

Hi Iebele,

The set overflow error includes a hint as to the problem in the form  
of a surface id.  Most likely, the trouble in your geometry is near  
this surface.  If it's not overlapping or collapsed geometry, then it  
might be a disk that's been converted to hundreds of triangles, all  
culminating at a single point, which cannot be resolved by oconv  
because there are more than 511 surfaces in an infinitesimal volume.

If you can identify all the triangles associated with this disk, you  
should be able to replace it with a single "ring" primitive, or if  
the edges need to match exactly, with a many-sided face primitive.

Hi Brett,

I hesitate to suggest it, because I don't know exactly how (or even  
if) it would work, but the new rtcontrib program is meant to solve  
just this sort of problem.  If you are feeling adventurous, check it  
out.

Hi Marija,

I missed this e-mail, but I guess everyone else did, too....

The compamb script only computes the ambient value for rpict and rvu  
in rad, not mkillum.  To get this, you are best off using the value  
given by gensky (assuming you're using gensky).  For example, "gensky  
8 10 15" spits out:

# gensky 8 10 15
# Local solar time: 14.77
# Solar altitude and azimuth: 47.3 70.4
# Ground ambient level: 18.1
(etc.)

For exterior calculations including mkillum, -av 18.1 18.1 18.1 would  
be appropriate.

As to the rest of the mkillum parameters, you have to think about how  
many bounces are important and set this yourself.  Rad is not smart  
enough to figure it out (and neither am I unless I know your geometry).

Hi Greg,

Indeed, there are triangulated rings in the geometry.  These 
triangulated rings are easy to identify.
Great! Thanks!

Subject: [Radiance-general] How to model a desk top lamp?
Message-ID: <000401c5f5ba$3eab40e0$a162e282@stbpc>

Dear Radiance users!

How do one make a model of a desk top lamp using Radiance. I know the type of flourescent tube I want to use (lenght, diameter, Ra-value and lumen) , but I don't know the shape of the reflector yet. I want to optimize the reflector shape and the way it is mounted in relation to the flourescent tube and optionally generate an ISO-lux diagram for the work plane and also to generate an ISO-lux table for import in Excel.

I have browsed Radiance-Online for "luminaire" and "lamp" just to find out that modelling luminaires/lamps always start with using an IESNA candlepower file which I don't have. So where do I start?

Best regards,

Steen Traberg-Borup

Steen,

I've found that the easiest way to deal with situations like this is to 
use some sort of forward ray-tracing program such as TracePro to model 
the luminaire you want with the materials that you want. Some of them 
get quite in-depth with their materials libraries, so specifying exactly 
what you want is generally not a problem. You should also be able to 
define the source you want and set the lamp lumens appropriately. After 
running the simulation, you can then output the distribution to an IES 
file for use in Radiance. I'm sure there are ways to do this strictly in 
radiance as well, but I'm not as familiar with the methods you might 
use. If anyone else has experience using only radiance for this sort of 
thing I would also be interested to hear how you did it as well.
