Hello @all,

first of all thank you Greg for helping me with this color problem, i 
found a mistake in my calculations, when i use rgb_xyz.cal i get the 
same results now for D65 white point.

I want to model a luminaire from my measured data and  as long as it is 
symmetric around the z axis it all goes well. But as soon as i want to 
write an .ies-file for a rectangular shaped luminaire with non 
symmetrical distribution the file doesnt' work.
This is my file:

Hi Christian,

Looking at your IES file, you say you want a distribution with 12 Vertical
Angles of data and 27 Horizontal angles of data.  Looking at your angles,
you have indeed provided 12 Vertical angles, but you have only provided 22
Horizontal angles, (unless my eyes are deceiving me).  I have checked a few
IES files I have used and converted successfully and these quantities should
match.

Also I am not sure if you have cut your lumen data up within the e-mail to
save space, but when you write the lumen data should you not have 12 x 27
(or 22) numbers, i.e. 27 (or 22) lines, each with 12 numbers in them.

I hope that helps.

Regards

Andrew

Hi Christian,

rshow isn't compiled with Cygwin and unlikely the standard Linux version 
will work with the Cygwin libs on a Windows box.
There's no release date for a Cygwin version- it would be nice, but the 
idea is scheduled on a non-priority position on my work stack.

Hi Andrew,

thanks for your help so far.

Ok you where right on this one, i worked with so many different files, i picked a wrong one.

------
Thats the point i am confused about, i measured 12 vertical angles of this luminaire and 22 horizontal.
When i have a symmetric luminaire, i write:
TILT=NONE
1 5000 1 13[vert.] 1[horiz.] 1 1 -0.2[width] 0[Lenght] 0[height] 1 1 55

0 [hor. values]

What do i have to write when i have the same vertical angles but additionally these
horizontal values and a rectangular shape?
degrees: 0  2.5  5  7.5  10  12.5  15  17.5  20  25  30  35  40  45  50  55  60  65  70  75  80  85  (22)

Message-ID: <44324C1A.10401@gmx.de>

Hi there,

-------
..."There's no release date for a Cygwin version"...
-------
@ Peter: Thank you for the information, what a pitty your programm looks 
quite handy. I always have problems with
this view direction vector under rvu.

Another question @all:
I use "mgfilt" for conversions of  degree Kelvin into  spectral data.
e.g.
mgfilt c,cspec
cct 2750
cspec 380 780 0.0673 0.0841 0.1038 0.1262 0.1516 0.1801 0.2116 0.2463 
0.2841 0.3251 0.3689 0.4157 0.4653 0.5173 0.5719 0.6286 0.6873 0.7479 
0.8100 0.8734 0.9379 1.0035 1.0695 1.1362 1.2028 1.2695 1.3359 1.4022 
1.4675 1.5322 1.5961 1.6589 1.7206 1.7808 1.8396 1.8968 1.9525 2.0064 
2.0584 2.1089 2.1572

How can it be that there are values above 1?  Can there be more than 
100%  "emission" at a certain  wavelength interval?
I didn't find any documentation on the mgfilt programm, is there one?

Thanks again,

Christian

Subject: [Radiance-general] subtended sun angle in gensky and gendaylit
Message-ID: <44325DE0.6070707@ise.fraunhofer.de>

Hi Francesco,
dear folk,

I have been in some discussions with a user about gendaylit and 
especially the cygwin- binary of it.
We found out, that the subtended angle of the sun differs from the 
original gendaylit (0.533) version to the one, which we can download on 
http://www.bozzograo.net/radiance(0.5 for cygwin binary).
For that reason, I checked in one of the main references in the solar 
world (Duffie, Beckman: Solar engineering of thermal processes) and 
found 32' for the subtended solar angle, which corresponds to 0.5333.

So I assume you changed the value in the source code, or? But as long as 
you are not adapting the radiance value of the light source (which you 
don't do), you'll loose more than 10% of the flux of the sun by reducing 
the value from 0.533 to 0.5 !!

Is there any reason to use 0.5 instead of 0.533?

And a question to Greg: gensky is also using 0.5. Is there any reference 
to that? But: As long as the overall flux is correct, the difference in 
the angle can be neglected.


For the cygwin-version of gendaylit I would suggest to correct that 
value in your version to 0.533 of the source code. In addition to this, 
I'll try to put a gendaylit version on our Web-page, which can be 
compiled also under cygwin without any modification. If ready, I'll 
announce this here again.

Cheers,

Jan

For each vertical angle you should have values for all horizontal 
angles. So the number of candela values is:
num_of_vertical_angles * num_of_horizontal angles

You can find IES file format specification in document "Thinking 
Photometrically" on the site:http://www.helios32.com/resources.htm


I hope this helps you,

Hi Christian,

The normalization of the spectral power distribution is unimportant,  
but I believe mgfilt outputs something that sums to 1.0 when  
integrated with the photopic curve.  Whatever it comes out to, the  
actual value is normalized by the reflectance or emission it's  
applied to.  Since you aren't applying it to anything, it doesn't  
matter.

Spectral power per wavelength can be any non-negative value (0 to  
infinity).  See also the previous thread entitled "specifying sources".

Hi Jan,

The 0.5 degree value in gensky is approximate, and could be corrected  
to 0.533.  This is not difficult to do.  The current radiance is  
figured using the 0.5 degree value, and could be adjusted.  I see no  
reason not to make such a correction in the next release.

Other opinions?

Whether this matters depends on how you determine the solar  
radiance.  Usually, it is derived from measurements of direct normal  
irradiance or illuminance (commonly found in climate files).  Rarely  
is the solar radiance or luminance measured directly.  Provided the  
solar radiance is determined in a consistent fashion from  
measurements of direct normal, then there is negligible practical  
difference as far any evaluation is concerned - the flux will be the  
same whatever the solid angle used for the sun.

In any case, the best measurements of direct normal are taken using a  
tracking device that commonly has an acceptance angle of 6deg (with,  
I recall, a fairly flat response).  This is because it is impractical  
to attempt to track the sun using anything with a much smaller angle,  
let alone an angle that matched exactly the solar disc.  So, when  
using these data from climate files etc., the difference between 0.5  
and 0.533 is made pretty much irrelevant because the sun radiance is  
being calculated from a measurement that includes a lot of  
circumsolar region also.

Intriguingly, in practical terms, this matters more for overcast  
rather than clear sky conditions (I can almost hear the gasps of  
disbelief).  For clear skies, the solar radiance dominates the  
brightness of of the circumsolar region -- so the "contamination"  
that results from basing the solar radiance on a measurement that  
includes the contribution of the circumsolar region is small.   
However, when a sky is overcast, the measurement of direct normal (in  
the climate file) is that which results from a (sunless) 6deg patch  
of sky.  Say that value is used routinely in an annual calculation  
procedure to determine the radiance of the 0.5deg sun.  Then, for  
overcast days, the solar radiance will be about ~144 times the  
radiance of the background sky (i.e. [6/0.5]**2).  So, a brightish  
sun will be a permanent feature in all your overcast skies.  If your  
evaluation is very sensitive to the magnitude of the sky and sun  
radiance or luminance (as I suspect Jan's is), then this may be an  
issue.  It's probably wise to play around with a threshold value  
below which the sun radiance is set to zero.

I've just noticed that the cygwin and mingw versions of gendaylit
produce different outputs. I think that I might have used a different
and older source package when I compiled the first cygwin version,
which also doesn't include the -G option.
At least I've understood that I didn't change the gendaylit code :P

I also agree with John about the weather data measurement accuracy,
and usually totally discard the direct normal solar component if lower
than 120 W/m2, as recommended by the WMO. I think S@tel-Light uses
a similar threshold to decide whether there is direct sun or not.

Ciao,

Francesco

hi all,

I have got a problem regarding texture/picture mapping on  a surface.I have 
got a surface of dimension 100X100 units and a picture of 10.0x.20.0 units.I 
am able to fill the surface by scaling the picture .
Now i want this picture to fill the whole surface, maintaining the original 
size of 10.0x 20.0 i.e.
10 picture should come in x- direction and 5 in y direction.Also is there 
any option in radiance texture mapping that automatically repeats the 
picture and maps it  to any surface to fill the whole surface maintaing the 
original size of texture/picture

I hope i was able to communicate the problem correctly

regards
Gurneet

Hi Gurneet,

I will try to answer your question. Based on your description the aspect 
ratio of the images is 1 to 2 (X to Y).

First thing to note is that the picture.cal function depends on a 
particular assumption about aspect ratio. For the sake of this function 
aspect ratio is considered as (Y/X) with the following implications (I 
hope I get this correct as I do not have RwR in front of me):

   1. if Y/X > 1, (vertical aspect ratio) then the unit dimension of the
      picture is the X dimension
   2. if Y/X = 1, then the picture is unit dimension 1x1
   3. if Y/X < 1, (horizontal aspect ratio) then the unit dimension of
      the picture is the Y dimension

So in your case the following material definition should work

void colorpict 10by20image
9 red green blue your_image.pic picture.cal pic_u pic_v -s 10
0
1 2

since the image is vertical in aspect if we scale by 10 then we get an 
image that takes up 10x20 units.

Now to get an image to tile automagically, you can use the tile_u tile_v 
functions of picture.cal as follows:

void colorpict 10by20image.tile
9 red green blue your_image.pic picture.cal tile_u tile_v -s 10
0
1 2

This should get you 10 tiles in X and 5 tiles in Y on a surface that 
measure 100x100. Note that you will need to apply transformations (-rx, 
-rz, -ry, -t x y z) if the geometry is not located at the origin or is 
transformed out of the x,y plane.

Hope this helps (and that I do not have things backwards on the aspect 
ration stuff).

Regards,

-Jack de Valpine

Dear John,

I meant a different thing: The implementation of the Perez sky model in 
RADIANCE is made in a way, that you plug in site information and direct 
and diffuse irradiation (regardless if those values a measured data or 
test reference years) and you will get a RADIANCE description of the sun 
as light and source. This model has been validated on different datasets 
in the past. If you change then the size of the source(from 0.533  to 
0.5) without a change of the "light" parameters (which are produce by 
gendaylit) and keeping all other factors, than you decrease the total 
flux of the sun (not of the sky, this remains the same since the 
parameters are the same). And therefore you get different results than 
using the original version.

This has nothing to do with the accuracy of the input radiation data, 
which is another issue which could be discussed.
It's just a simple implementation matter of the tool. I totally agree 
that the size change of the sun has no significant impact as long as the 
total flux is kept (which isn't in our case here).

Thanks for your answer Greg,
---------------------
The normalization of the spectral power distribution is unimportant,  
but I believe mgfilt outputs something that sums to 1.0 when  
integrated with the photopic curve.  Whatever it comes out to, the  
actual value is normalized by the reflectance or emission it's  
applied to.  Since you aren't applying it to anything, it doesn't  
matter.
----------------------
The problem is, i am applying the spectrum of this lamp to a color filter spectrum.
The spectral data of this filter is normalized to 1 or 100%. There are values from 0,0000 up to 1.
If i multiply these two spectra as shown in "Rendering with Radiance" p.435, i think the data should be normalized
to the same standard, or am i wrong?
My output is a combined spectrum and then i convert it back to CIExy values, then with xyz_rgb.cal to RGB.
Thats why i want to know how mgfilt works and what it is capable of. Is there any man page?

Hi Christian,

The two spectra do not have to be normalized to the same value.  In  
fact, you can multiply the cspec output by mgfilt by the lumens of  
your light source and the transmission of your filter (between 0 and  
1 at each wavelength) and get something related to the lumen output  
over the spectrum.

Man pages for MGF can be found on the website -- I assumed you had this:

Message-ID: <B1FFC07B4DFA55428AFE50D6C7F0A745E8438F@NDJSEVS12.ndc.nasa.gov>

Hi All,

We have been using Radiance in our lab for many years performing
lighting analyses mainly for exterior (on orbit) activities involving
the shuttle and the space station. We are now beginning to do more
interior lighting evaluations such as the space station laboratory
module. 

The interiors we evaluate tend to have a lot of white, non specular
surfaces. So diffuse interreflections seem to be important. I've been
looking into the parameters that control the ambient calculation in
Radiance and I am baffled by the "-ab" ambient bounces parameter. I
thought, by keeping all other parameters the same and increasing the
ambient bounces, the results should be more accurate. That is not what I
see from our test case.

We built a box 17" x 17" x 36" with white walls. The wall material
properties were measured. A calibrated light source was placed in a hole
at one end of the box. Illuminance measurements were taken at various
points within the closed box. We then modeled the environment in
Radiance and took illuminance values at the same points. After some
experimentation I settled on the following ambient settings:

      av: 0.0 0.0 0.0
      aa: 0.08
      ab: 3
      ad: 1024
      as: 512
      ar: 64
      
The errors between Radiance and measured values were less than 10%. 

But as I increased the ambient bounces beyond 3, the illuminance values
at the points kept increasing. By 5 bounces the errors were averaging
over 60%. 

It appears that I am missing something fundamental. I'm hoping the group
can help me out. 

Thanks,
rick

As this thread has been broadened somewhat (or slightly hijacked):  
Christoph - do you set a direct normal threshold in DAYSIM as

Rick,

I believe this is a known but rarely encountered condition.  Radiance  
has various optimisations -- one of them is to assume that the  
overall environment  reflectance is 0.5 (Greg, is that right?).   
That's fine for most realistic architecture.  Your situation is more  
like an integrating sphere.  From an earlier (private) exchange with  
Greg regarding a "dodgy" validation where this effect showed up:

It sounds like you have one of those "bizarre test cases".  Which is  
fair enough given the setting.

Hi Rick,

The AVGREFL macro notwithstanding, you shouldn't be converging to the  
wrong result when you increase the -ab setting under any  
circumstances.  This sounds suspiciously like a bug, and it may be  
related to the sampling bias problem that Rick Mistrick and Younju  
Yoon ran across in their work at State College (Pennsylvania).  It  
only shows up in very particular situations, but maybe yours is one  
of them.

If you don't mind, please send me your test scene privately, and the  
commands you used to generate your results.

Thanks,
-Greg

Hello,

 

I am just starting to use Radiance. I would like to know how to import
from Ecotect to Radiance. I already have my building defined in 3D by
the software Ecotect, I tried it but it seems to have a problem and the
rendering image does not work. Does anybody had this problem before and
knows how to solve it?

In the documentation of Ecotest it was said that you have to create a
camera view inside the building and then exporting to radiance simply
but it could happen that there is an installation issue and the windows
that is supposed to appear disappear.

At this first step I really do not know what

 

Thanks

Hi Fabienne,
 
You have to install Desktop (or another Windows-based version of
Radiance) before you can use it with ECOTECT. In order to install
Desktop Radiance, you can follow these instructions ->

Also make sure you always check your materials in the RADIANCE file. There
seem to be some unexpected results, especially with the 'glass' material.

And check the orientation of the building when using non-overcast skies.

Hi @all,

The glass material is probably a better approximation in this case,  
as it will account for the change in reflection and transmission with  
angle.

That is correct.  If you set the -dj option to something between 0.5  
and 0.8, you will sample over a larger subregion.  (A setting of -dj  
1 is allowed, but only works if all the sources in your scene are  
rectangular.)

Christian, are you referring to the appearance of the illuminance patch 
on a surface near the source, or rather the apparent brightness of the 
source polygon?  If the former, this could be the result of having -ds 
set too low.

Hello,

 

Thanks for your answer Christoph, I have done what you said but I fear that my problem is something about installation. I already have a Windows-based version of Radiance but it was telling me: "C:\Adeline3\bin\rad.exe: error running rview"

I think the Radiance program is not well-installed because it does not work with Ecotect neither.

Could this message appear because the view is not well defined too?

Moreover, does anyone has used Adeline before and think it is reliable?

Fabienne,
If I understand your problem correctly, then the DOS window appears and then
quickly disappears without any error message. If this is the case, the most
likely cause of your problem is that you have defined a material that
Radiance cannot find (as Christoph mentioned). What I would recommend as a
troubleshooting step is to redefine the materials of all objects in your
model into a material in the Ecotect library, and then try rendering. Please
let us know if the issue persists.

Fabienne, 

Probably you'll need to say to ECOTECT where the RADIANCE is installed. 
As you must say to Windows where is the RAYPATH.
You also have to pay attention to avoid blank spaces in your RADIANCE
path. 

A better solution is to use the Cygwin (in Window$$ OS) with the hotest
version of RADIANCE. The Windows version of RADIANCE (inside DESKTOP
RADIANCE) is out of date, as you know.

regards
vangelis

Hi Greg, hi Rob,

thanks so far with the -ds and -dj options. Yes Rob i meant the 
appearance of the illuminance patch.
Concerning the glass with the values of a Lee color filter i just want 
to make sure that i got all right:
I calculated the RGB values from the spectrum, taking in consideration 
that Y is not =1 but 0.642.
Then i got the transmissivity which is 0.92.
I multiplied my RGB values with 0.92 and thats it, or not?

Is there some kind of "roughness" for glass too? The glass with the 
filter on top is too "glossy", reflective, shiny or whatever you would 
call it. I would want it more "dull". ( I dont know if this is the right 
term in this context)

I really don't know where you got the 0.92 value from a normal  
transmittance of 0.642, assuming that's what Y is.  The proper  
procedure is to figure out the transmission from the transmittance  
using ray/src/cal/cal/trans.cal, which is also discussed on p. 240 of  
"Rendering with Radiance."  First, you need to normalize your RGB  
values to match your Y normal transmittance.  For this, you can use  
ray/src/cal/xyz_rgb.cal.  Run the following:

	cd ray/src/cal/cal
	icalc xyz_rgb.cal trans.cal

Let's say you have a measured RGB of 82 53 19, you would define a  
normalization factor like so:

	nf = 0.642 / Y(82,53,19)

Then, compute the actual RGB normal transmittances using:

	82 * nf
	$1=0.900124166

	53 * nf
	$2=0.581787571

	19 * nf
	$3=0.208565356

(The lines with '$' in front are the outputs of icalc.)  Then, set  
these values one by one to the Tn (normal transmittance) variable  
used in trans.cal, and query the tn (normal transmission) value that  
corresponds:

	Tn = $1
	tn
	$4=0.980257446

	Tn = $2
	tn
	$5=0.6342239

	Tn = $3
	tn
	$6=0.227507866

These are the values you actually use in glass:

	void glass LeeGlass
	0
	0
	3 0.980 0.634 0.228

This assumes your glass has an index of refraction of 1.52.  If this  
is wrong, then you should assign a different value of n before you  
compute the tn values, and add the appropriate value to the glass  
primitive.

I have no clue what a Lee filter looks like.  Is it smokey?  Is it  
rough?  There is no roughness value for glass -- Radiance assumes  
this is a polished surface.  In case of a rough front surface and a  
smooth back surface, you will have to do something special.  In the  
case of scattering in the transmission distribution, you can use the  
trans type and use the winxmit.cal file with a brightfunc to  
approximate the angular transmission.

Wed Jan 25 05:12:05 CET 2006 
Hello all,
I've been lurking for some time, trying to keep up on the developments
in
both Radiance and HDRI.

In any case, to post something that MAY be of interest to others...
This is probably old news, but just in case, I have successfully
replaced
the Radiance binaries that are installed with Desktop Radiance with the
updated ones (version 3R7P1, I believe) that Francesco compiled back in
October. I have been using the Radiance Control Panel (part of EcoTect)
as
the GUI front end to Radiance, and so far, everything seems to work
smoothly.

These are the steps I took:
1. I copied the contents of each folder (bin, lib, obj, doc, and runs)
from
the Mingwin binaries that Francesco compiled into the corresponding
folder
in C:\Radiance. This allowed me to replace any updated binaries, while
keeping the older binaries of programs that were not compiled (ie.
Anything
that requires xwindows)
2. I copied RadianceIV (the image viewer that comes as part of EcoTect)
into
C:\Radiance, and then renamed it winimage (the name of the image viewer
that
is installed as part of Desktop Radiance)

I have by no means tested this installation to see if all programs work,
but
so far with the basic renderings I have run, I have had no problems
whatsoever. Also, because RadianceIV can post-process images, I have
been
producing falsecolor images as well as contour line images directly from
RadianceIV (aka winimage).

So, for those who, for one reason or another, can only work in the
Window$
environment, these binaries completely revamp Desktop Radiance.

Francesco, Greg, Lars, or John, would it be possible to maintain updated
Window$ binaries so that those of use stuck using Window$ can at least
benefit from the latest developments and fixed in the Radiance binaries?

One caveat: rvu is not included in those binaries (the download link 
states non-graphical tools only), and the older rview will choke on any 
octrees created with newer versions of oconv, regardless of whether the 
file contains any of the newer entities (like meshes).

Hi Chris,

The Desktop Radiance version of Radiance does not contain some of the 
new features of the current release of Radiance. However DR does have a 
gui of sorts whereas Radiance is really a toolset of applications that 
are typically utilized via the command line on unix/linux/osx type 
operating systems. There are a few other frontends including Rayfront 
(www.schorsch.com).

Depending on what you are going to end up doing with Radiance it can be 
very worthwhile to learn how to use the command line version on 
unix/linux/osx as the os.

You will also need a modeling application such as Autocad, Rhino or some 
other application that can output the correct geometry format (.obj 
format files for example).

Hope this helps as a starting point.

-Jack

Hi Chris,

As Vangelis pointed out in an earlier post, Desktop Radiance is out  
of date -- about 7 years and counting.  Unfortunately, there's no way  
to bring it up to date, and the current effort is to put out a  
Windows edition of the current version.  Large parts of the system  
compile, but there appear to be some problems remaining with the  
parallel processing bits and rvu, which needs a user interface or a  
working X11 server.  This is why some people are using the Cygwin  
binaries, which run in a subenvironment to Windows.

Personally, I think you're 10 times better off with FreeBSD, Linux,  
or OS X if you want to run Radiance.  The latest iMac's and MacBook  
Pro are basically as fast as the PC's, if a little more expensive.   
They're also better built, unless you're willing to spend the time  
building your own machine, as some people like to do.

-Greg

Thanks guys,

Its been a couple of years since I last used Radiance  but now need  
to do some false color images and wanted to get the current lay-of- 
the-land.

Take care,

High Christoph,

Sorry for writing to you directly.  I still do not know the right way to
respond to a message on the Radiance-general Digest. 

What "other Windows-based version of Radiance" do you mean in you message?
I know only about Desktop.  Are there other Windows-based versions?

Hi Greg,

thank you very much for your detailed answer, i think the biggest 
problem i am confronted with are these different terms.
As i understand:
* transmissivity* is the amount of light that is not absorbed inside an 
object, varies between 0and 1, not taking in consideration the reflection
*total transmittance *the amount of light, that passes through an 
object, taking in consideration the index of refraction and is less than 
the transmissivity
But what is* transmission* ?
As i want to apply the color and transmission of this color filter to 
the glass i got these values from LEE:
Transmission *Y%: 62.4*  ; Absorption: *0.21* ; as well as a Spectrum 
from which i calculated the xy chromaticity values with the mgfilt 
command: *cxy 0.2884 0.3034*
They have precalculated XYZ and Yxy values for different sources, but i 
want to apply my own source at different dim and color temperature 
levels.  http://www.leefilters.com/LPFD.asp?PageID=193
To get my RGB values, i have to calculate the XYZ values and for that i 
need Y! Can i take 0.624 ?
As i understand it, my resulting RGB components should be the same as 
your example normalized ones.
Then i would apply them to trans.cal to get the normal transmission.
Maybe i am dead wrong but thats how i see it.
Thanks,

Christian

That's my mistake -- I should have said "transmissivity" rather than  
transmission.  A transmission is the thing in your car that shifts  
gears...  In fact, I think the term is used interchangeably in a more  
informal context with total transmittance.

Total transmittance takes into account reflections and  
interreflections (and absorbtion) inside the glass, and is the  
easiest value to measure.

Actually, the Y value of transmittance can change for different light  
sources.  What you should do is multiply the value you were given  
(0.624) by the Y you get with your source spectrum, divided by the Y  
you get when you use their reference source spectrum.  The confusing  
part is that you need to normalize the two spectra using the Y value  
computed from each WITHOUT your glass transmittance spectrum.

Is this clear enough?  I know it's confusing, but I don't know how to  
explain it any better without adding a bunch of pictures and diagrams.

Hi,

Is there any file format interoperability between Radiance and  
Maxwell. (http://www.maxwellrender.com/)
Maxwell makes very pretty pictures but I see no way to capture the

plans to make some file interchange possible.

Thanks,

Hi Chris,

I don't think that Maxwell saves files in an HDR format, so I'm not sure 
how that kind of info could be shared.  I've also inquired with 
NextLimit about the possibility of illiminance & luminance info being 
extracted from the program and only gotten vague replies in return.  
Dunno what's going on there, really.

Hello
I would like to know if there is any restriction for the work surface.
Is it supposed to be a quadrilateral polygon? I still have the some
problem to export from the files Ecotect to Radiance. I have the
problem: "Error: some line(s) with code 73 define a non quadrilateral
polygon".
I do not know if it is because the work surface is not well-defined or
because it is not possible to define a non quadrilateral surface.
Does anybody had the error before?
Thanks,
Fabienne

The actual distance at which the ambient calculation starts to  
degrade is the octree bounding cube size, which is the final number  
reported by "getinfo -d octree", divided by the -ar setting.  Source  
geometry affects this like any other geometry, except for distant  
sources, which are not really geometry per se.

Hi all,

   I want to experiment with the texture of the materials by modifying the
x, y and/or z normals of the surfaces in order to see how the reflected
light changes in its characteristics. However, when I modify the
normals, using texfunc as the following example, apparently, just the
main normal is modified.

   void texfunc id
   3 Px*A1  Py*A2  PZ*A3
   0
   3 A1 A2 A3


   Does anyone have any suggestions on how I can make a "grid of normals"
in order to modify the normals of smaller regions of the surface? and
how can I change the scale of that "grid"?
Thanks in advance,

As part of my master's thesis, I am doing only interior Daylight
simualtion. No luminares are defined.The runs are solely daylight. I am
using an already built space. The location used is Dubai (United Arab
Emirates), and because this location is not available I had to define it.
Although I had all the required parameters, when I do the runs the results
does not seem to  change, and to check it out correctly I tried to do the
runs during night times, around 10 pm and to my surprise I had light in
the space.
Could anyone help..

Thank you,
Maitha Dalmouk

Perhaps your -av setting is too high.

Just mix two textures. The second texture is ten times smaller and superimposed on the first one, I believe - let me know if it does not work

Subject: [Radiance-general] Textures: perturbations in x,y,z normals




Hi all,

   I want to experiment with the texture of the materials by modifying the
x, y and/or z normals of the surfaces in order to see how the reflected
light changes in its characteristics. However, when I modify the
normals, using texfunc as the following example, apparently, just the
main normal is modified.

   void texfunc id
   3 Px*A1  Py*A2  PZ*A3
   0
   3 A1 A2 A3


   Does anyone have any suggestions on how I can make a "grid of normals"
in order to modify the normals of smaller regions of the surface? and
how can I change the scale of that "grid"?
Thanks in advance,

Hi Adriana,

What do you want your surface to look like?  What do you want your  
normals to do?

The string arguments of the "texfunc" primitive define expressions  
for a "perturbation" of the surface normal, i.e., a value to be added  
to the default surface normal.  In your example, depending on the  
values of A1, A2, and A3 (and assuming "PZ" should have been "Pz"),  
you would get a surface normal that would change gradually according  
to the position in 3-dimensional space, forcing whatever object was  
covered to have a surface normal resembling that of a sphere the  
larger the object became.  This seems a very strange goal to me.

Hi Greg,

In effect, what I get is the resemblance of a shpere the larger the
object. For this reason, I feel that I'm using "texfunc" in an improper
way for what I need. My objective is to modify the x, y and/or z normals
of a surface in order to analize how much R, G and/or B is being
absorbed/reflected. I know that depending on the texture of a surface, for
example, shortwavelenghs of the spectrum are more reflected than the short
waves of the spectrum. What I need is to create a "bumpy" surface in order
to see how much blue is reflected depending on the scale of this
"bumpiness" ( from very small scale-microscale, if possible, to
macroscale) and by having control of the perturbation of the x, y and z
normals. Is there a logic way in how to do this?

Hi Adriana,

If you are hoping to model diffraction effects -- where geometric  
optics break down and wave optics take over -- you will be  
disappointed to learn that Radiance does not handle this case.  Few  
ray-tracing systems do.  Diffraction becomes important when the scale  
of surface variations (texture or thin films) is on the order of the  
wavelength of light, less than a micron or so.  For this, you need a  
tool such as Code V from ORA:

	http://www.opticalres.com/news/cv96.html

I believe they have student pricing for their tools.

Hi Greg,

thank you again and YES it is confusing!

>Actually, the Y value of transmittance can change for different light

Forget my other question, at first i want to make sure that i model a 
simple filter in the right way.
And that is why i want to stick to the values LEE gives for a 3200K lamp.
These are: X= 58.8 , Y=62.4 , Z=37.2
with xyz_srgb.cal i get: R= 76.088002   G=61.6146944   B= 29.8622268, ( 
i want to calculate this with the D65 white point)
As the filter won't have a bigger transmission than 1, i divide through 
100.
Now i get values of: R= .761   G= .616   B= .299;
If i apply these to glass polygon i get a yellow/orange filter with my 
tungsten 3200 K source in the scene.
Then is subtract 1 from RGB =  .239 , .384,  .701;
 These values should now represent my blue filter, and it looks quite good!

void glass LeeGlass
	0
	0
	3  .239  .384  .701

Am i right up to now?

These values would then be my normal transmittance. In order to model a disc of 'real'colored glass (e.g. n=1.52) i would apply these values to 'trans.cal' how you suggested an get the transmissivity.
rcalc -f trans.cal -e '$1=tn($1)'
.239
0.260699013
.384
0.418782103
.701
0.763929466

Am i right here too?

Now i want to triple the effect of the filter, that means have 3  blue filters in a row. My Y=.624 would then be 
Y? = .243, can i simply multiply my normal transmittance of RGB with this factor to get the triple effect?

I know these are pretty simple questions, but as i plan to use the 'trans' material later i want to make sure to be on the right way!

Yes, apparently PhotoShop CS2 has some "HDR" features. So now every
talentless hick with a digital camera and tripod is making badly
tone-mapped images and calling it "HDR". Just look at the comments on the
Wikipedia HDRI article:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:High_dynamic_range_imaging#Flickr_HDR_group.3F
(I'm 'Imroy', BTW)

I seem to have been successful in keeping the link to the Flickr "HDR"
group out of the article. But people keep adding their own tone-mapped
images and I'm trying to explain to them that they don't accurately
represent HDRI. I'm not really sure of an alternative though. Any
suggestions from the list?

Hi Kirk,

Here's some info for you.  My initial report, posted to radiance-online.org:

http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-February/003446.html

I also posted some rants and raves on my website:

http://www.rumblestrip.org/2006/02/27/woohoo
http://www.rumblestrip.org/2006/03/02/good-and-bad
http://www.rumblestrip.org/2006/04/09/windows-on-mac

And you will notice that my system is currently listed fourth fastest on 
Mark Stock's Radiance benchmark page, here:

http://mark.technolope.org/pages/rad_bench.html

All in all I'm thrilled with it, but the squeal is still there (see my 
"good and bad" post for details), and I haven't called Apple about it 
yet.  But it's very fast, the display is crisp, and I finally have an OS 
X computer that can run AutoCAD.   I'm hopeful that Parallels gets their 
act together and figures out how to allow the virtualized windows disk 
to share with the Apple filesystem, but it also sounds like Apple's 
working on their own solution for this.

This discussion probably belongs on the HDRI mailing list, as opposed  
to radiance-general, so I'm cross-posting.

You might mention in your postings that Photosphere can output JPEG- 
HDR images suitable for web sites, which people who use Photosphere  
will then see as full HDR images.  You can even e-mail them -- there  
are quite a few examples buried on my site, such as:

	http://www.anyhere.com/gward/snaps/Tuolumne2005/img/ 
TuolumneRiver4_lA64.jpg

GrandCanyon3_lC21.jpg
	http://www.anyhere.com/gward/snaps/GrandCanyon2006/img/Sedona3_l1AF.jpg

Unfortunately, you just have to dig through my recent snapshots to  
find them...  Also, not everyone has Photosphere, being as more than  
half(!) the computing world is still using Windows, but the JPEGs  
view as tone-mapped images on other software, and you can download  
free converter programs from BrightSide Technologies to get you  
between JPEG and Radiance format images:

	http://www.brightsidetech.com/products/process.php

Since Photoshop CS2 (and I believe Photomatrix) can output Radiance  
format images, you can go from there to JPEG-HDR using the BrightSide  
conversion tools, and back again on the receiving end.  Hopefully,  
we'll have a plug-in for Photoshop before too long.

OK, I see these values on the URL you sent earlier <http:// 
www.leefilters.com/LPFD.asp?PageID=193>.

Since the XYZ values were measured using a 3200 K tungsten  
illuminant, converting to sRGB only gives you back the same orange  
color.  You haven't really changed illuminants, because xyz_srgb.cal  
doesn't do a white-point conversion.

Does the scene your simulating use a tungsten source or not?  If it  
does, you should model it as a pure white light, because you have  
incorporated the illuminant color into your filter.  (This isn't a  
good idea for transmission as the angular function will be incorrect.)

> Then is subtract 1 from RGB =  .239 , .384,  .701;

This where you lost me completely.  What made you think to subtract  
each value from 1?  It doesn't work that way, even if it gets you  
what you were expecting.

> These values should now represent my blue filter, and it looks  
> quite good!

If you want blue out of your filter from a tungsten source, you won't  
get it.  You'll get something bluer than the source, but not truly  
blue.  This all gets involved in the white balance issue, which I  
cover in depth in the paper I keep mentioning:

	http://www.anyhere.com/gward/papers/egwr02/

I know it's a difficult read, but until you understand white  
balancing, colors are going to look consistently wrong to your eyes.

Hi Greg, hi everyone else,

This is an example of an rsp file (Optio 430):
3 1.44593 -0.999398 0.575389 -0.0219197
3 1.23165 -0.639997 0.413386 -0.00504164
3 1.07103 -0.436035 0.351256 0.0137438

Is it correct to assume that the 1st coefficient is the highest one (3rd
order in this case), so would the formula be (for Red channel):

'PENTAX Optio 430 '
1.44593*x**3 + -0.999398*x**2 + 0.575389*x + -0.0219197

If so, then this is a plot for some cams I've created with gnuplot (again
Red only):
http://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/pickup/rsp_gnuplot.png

If plotted for x [0:255], that would give a dynamic range of 7 log units
for one photograph. Seem a bit excessive. Am I missing some important
detail here?

Cheers

Hi Axel,

Your interpretation of the coefficients is correct, but the [0-255]  
values are converted to a [0-1] range being put into the  
polynomials.  This would account for your odd results.

Message-ID: <10101.213.58.97.212.1146065390.squirrel@webmail1.londonmet.ac.uk>

Hi Peter,

> remotely controlled (shutter speed etc. for HDR) under Linux  ?

E995:
- USB interface shows up as hard drive, so is no good for remote control
- RS232 cable (available for E990) allows for remote control, BUT not
setting of shutter/aperture, so you are limited to the +/- 2 EV AEB which
can be combined with +/- 2 EV MEC to give in theory +/- 4EV.

E990:
- Starting with this model, Nikon have systematically removed remote
control funtionality (hence 995 problems)
- Both, USB and serial may be used to change settings (USB will not show
up as HD)
- my particular model hangs when remotely pushing the trigger via USB, but
serial works. This seems to be a general problem with 990s.
- AEB only +/- 0.7 EV
- no built-in noise reduction!
- full remote control over aperture and shutter speed

E4500:

Same problem as 995 -- Nikon deliberately crippled this functionality,
probably to force people to go D-range ($$$!)

What appears to be a USB connector is on fact a combination of USB and
RS232. There are enough pins to break out both. I'd be terribly surprised
if the MC-EU1 serial remote control would not work with the E4500.
However, unless you get one given to you, I wouldn't recommend buying one
(at least not for the full RRP). It only gives you zoom, trigger and a
sorta time lapse that can't go below 2 mins, and doesn't even display the
time remaining until the next shot.

TechnoTeam in Ilmenau, DE have teamed up with Rollei to produce a camera
that has a special firmware for HDR (-9T, -3T, T, +3T, +9T). This gizmo
also comes with a complete set of calibration files and some Windoze
software. Don't know about the pricing, though.

I've recently got myself a 5 Pound (price, not weight!) Palm pilot on
e-bay.  They have a serial interface and can control CoolPixes. There is
sone stuff on the web:
a) http://vyskocil.free.fr/cool (closed source)
b) http://timeguy.com/cradek/palmshotcom/ (GPL)

Based on b), I intend to hack together 'PalmHDR', once I've got some time.
I'll keep you updated.

Hi Greg,

OK, i think i was dead wrong! Thinking about some things makes your 
brain go crazy.
But i don't want to give up. I went through your paper, several times, 
and through your discussion with Will on the list about "specifying 
sources".
Additionally i read "Tools for Lighting Design an Analysis".
To get this right from scratch:

1. I have reflectance values for surfaces in XYZ. Measured with an 
spectrofotometer with a D65 test source inside. Actually it was the same
   Minolta CM-2002 as in your paper. I have data with and without the 
specular component. (SCI or SCE) Which on would you suggest or does it 
depend on the surface?
 
2. These surfaces are to be seen in a scene with sources which have 
color temperatures ranging from 2400 to 3000 Kelvin.
    For these sources i calculated the xy coordinates with blackbody.cal.
   
3. I think this is the first problem.  The reflectance values for the 
surfaces should have been measured with a tungsten test illuminant in 
the spectrofotometer.
    And the spectral data would have been better than XYZ. Is that right?

4. As i understand you in your conversation with Will, the 
premultiplying part is only efficient if i would have spectral data. If 
i have only XYZ data, i convert both reflectance values and color values 
of the sources to Sharp RGB color space like so:
 rcalc    -f xyz_rgb.cal      -f Sharp.cal    -e '$1=R($1,$2,$3); 
$2=G($1,$2,$3);  $3=B($1,$2,$3);'

5. Now i render my picture and add the correct primaries to the picture 
header with your suggested script. (addSharp.csh)

6. When i call 'ximage' with rtrace -I, i should get the right 
illuminance values or not?

7. To change the primaries for a special display i use 'pcond' later. I 
guess 'pcond' does a white point transformation?

8. Does 'normtiff' does a white point transformation as well?

Would this procedure be the best what i can get out if my data for 
"correct" color display?
Many thanks again and regards,

Christian

Hi Christian,

It sounds like we're back on track, here.  I'm relieved.

I typically use the SCE to get the diffuse and the difference between  
the SCI and SCE (specular included and excluded) measurements to get  
the specular reflectance component, but it only works for fairly  
smooth surfaces.  If a surface is too rough, the components get mixed  
in the glossy reflection, which ends up being larger than the  
specular trap in the CM-2002.

For non-metals, the SCE value is better for determining the surface  
color.  For metallic surfaces, I would use SCI.

Did you erase the info. from the CM-2002?  Maybe the spectral data is  
still there.  It would be better to use it if you have it.  Even if  
you used a tungsten illuminant to determine the XYZ value, shifting  
to a different illuminant without the spectral data is a shaky business.

This is correct.

Right.

Umm...  It doesn't matter what you give to ximage at that point,  
since you're having rtrace do the calculation.  This is  just as  
well, since ximage ignores the color primary and white point  
information in the picture header, and would report (slightly) wrong  
luminance with the 'l' command starting from anything besides  
Radiance RGB color space.

> 7. To change the primaries for a special display i use 'pcond'

Yes.  It performs a proper von Kries transformation, using the Sharp  
color adaptation matrix.

> 8. Does 'normtiff' does a white point transformation as well?

Yes.  If a Radiance converter takes a -p option with 6 arguments,  
then it's doing color and white point conversion.

I think so.  I won't make you any warranties, though.  Without  
spectral data, the accuracy is going to be highly dependent on your  
particular materials.

Dear Community,

Events have necessitated that the dates of the workshop be moved back  
to Wed/Thu 13/14 September (original dates were 11/12 September).

Apologies for this change which has proved unavoidable.  I have  
informed everybody that has already expressed an interest (e-mail  
sent 26 April) but I expect there are others that have not yet  
contacted me.

I will post a flyer about the event next week once I get some details  
about presentations that have already been offered.

Regards,

-John Mardaljevic

Subject: [Radiance-general] Luminous Efficacy
Message-ID: <001a01c66a26$ca9df990$8ef24581@bauphysik7pc>

Dear All

 

As a part of my Ph.D research I am doing a study about the influence of the colors of surfaces on the illuminance at any arbitrary point of the room under daylighting condition. So I need to know about the exact relationship between the color of a surface and its luminance. For that reason I am going to do some simulation with radiance. As  I have just common knowledge of using radiance, sorry if my questions are too basic.

 

The calculation method used in ?Radiance? for computing  the luminance value is:

Luminance = 179 * (0.265*R + 0.670*G + 0.065*B)                                            (1)

Where the 179 value has been defined so: The value of 179 lm/w is the standard luminous efficacy of equal energy white light that is defined and used by Radiance specifically for this conversion.

 

1. Unfortunately I could not find this value at any other document about lighting and colour measurement. Does anybody know how the value of 179 has been derived? I assume it is the average of all the luminous efficacies in visible light spectrum (380 ? 780 nm). Isn't it ?

 

2. As I know, the method for calculating the luminance is:

L = 683 ? I (?) * ? (?) * V (?) d?                                                                             (2)

 

Where: 0=<V (?) < =1 and has a maximum of 1 at 555 nm and I (?) is the Spectrum power distribution at any wavelength of arbitrary spectrum. If I have understood correctly,  in the file ?src/common/color.h? the value of (0.265*R + 0.670*G + 0.065*B) will give us the tristimulus value ?Y?, which is the same as: Y= ? I (?) * ? (?) * ?y (?) d?                                                              (3)

 

Since ?y (?) = V (?) for computing the luminance value (according to the methods (2), (3)) what we should do is to multiply the Y value at 683 which gives:

Luminance = 683 * (0.265*R + 0.670*G + 0.065*B) 

 

I suppose if we use the method (1), it means that we have calculated luminance so: L = 179 ? I (?) * ? (?) * V (?) d?  

That means the value of 179 lm/w has been used as maximum luminous efficacy instead of 683 lm/w at 555 nm??



And if 179 has been used as average, I can not understand why we shoud average again , whereas behind the 683 ?  V (?) d?  (380nm- 78nm) there is the meaning of averaging the luminous efficacy over the visible light spectrum.



I hope I could make my questions understandable.

If I have gotten the concept wrong, I would be thankful if somebody could tell me where my mistake is, it would be really important and helpful for the result of my research.

                                                                         

 

Thank you in advance

I hope I can clarify this.  We seem to be caught in some kind of

That's correct, but the actual value is very sensitive to where you  
set the endpoints of what constitute "visible," since the tails  
represent a greater proportion of energy relative to what's visible.   
In this sense, the value is somewhat arbitrary, and as long as you  
divide by 179 on the way in and multiply by 179 on the way out, the  
value cancels and is therefore irrelevant.  Integrating equal-energy  
white from 380 to 780 gets you something very close to 179, though I  
can't promise it's exact.  I can promise it doesn't matter.

How do you figure?  For this to work, the luminous efficacy of the  
white corresponding to our RGB color space would have to be 683  
lumens/watt.  The only light that matches this efficacy is a  
monochromatic source at 555 nm.  Let's hope we don't have an RGB  
color space with a monochromatic green white point.

The white point defined in Radiance (different from most other RGB  
spaces) is equal-energy white, hence the luminous efficacy of 179,  
which is just a conversion factor as discussed above.

No, because Eq. (1) assumes not a spectrum but a tristimulus color  
space.  They are different beasts, and you can't go freely from one  
to the other like they represent the same information.  They do not.   
Data is irretrievably lost when you convert from a continuous  
spectrum to any tristimulus space (eg., RGB or XYZ).

You don't average again.  Equations (1) and (2) are correct.  Eq. (3)  
is missing a normalization constant, and the subsequent equations are  
confused because of that.  Y = L from Eq. (2).

If you can understand why the coefficients 0.265 + 0.670 + 0.065 add  
up to one, whereas the *maximum* value of V(lambda) is 1.0, I think  
you will resolve your mystery.

I try to retrieve the spectral data.

As i think i understand this procedure, now i am left with my last problem:

I have a plexiglass cylinder with a height of ca. 2 cm  and a radius of 
ca. 15 cm.
I got the transmission/transmissivity of this glass from the 
manufacturer it?s around 92%.

On top and on the side of this cylinder there is this LEE 061 Mist Blue 
color filter attached.
I have the spectrum of this filter.

This cylinder is part of a news desk in a studio and ca. 1 m under this 
glass there is a incandescent spotlight ca. 3200K  that shines at it.
The whole desk is in the same scene described in my previous mail, color 
temperatures vary from 2400 - 3200 K.

I have the problem now that this filter is not attached directly to a 
lamp. If it would be like this i would simply multiply the two spectra 
and convert to CIE xy etc..
Like in 'RwR' p. 435

Now i want to ad the color attributes of this filter somehow to this 
cylinder:
I think the best way to simulate this, is to use the 'trans' material 
because the surface shouldn't be so shiny or polished like the glass 
material.
I made an Excel sheet to calculate the 'trans' parameters but it's 
confusing.

What would you suggest?
(I promise this my last problem ;-)

Thanks again,

Christian

Message-ID: <8A5DFFE7-3FD9-4718-A64D-60115F516B22@dmu.ac.uk>

Google bought SketchUp a few months ago.  Today they have released a  
free, but limited, version of SketchUp (Mac OS X & Windows):

http://sketchup.google.com/

Pro version is as before with, I think, one or two minor additions.

SketchUp is so easy to use that I managed to create a 3D model for a  
project whilst learning how to use SketchUp and got it done well  
before the 8hr evaluation period ran out (Pro version).  Search this  
site for "3ds2rad" for how to convert from 3DS to Radiance format.

Here's the catch: only the Pro version exports SU models to formats  
such as 3DS etc.  So I'm afraid that the offer of a free version of  
SU is not terribly useful for Radiance users.  Where it may count is  
to have it sitting there as a freebie which you can toy with every  
now and then and perhaps learn how to use as a 'background' task.   
Then when you really do need to use SU to make a Radiance model, you  
could either buy the Pro version or see how much you could get done  
during the 8hr demo period.  I don't know if you could run the Free  
and Pro versions alongside each other; that would be a sneaky way of  
getting a lot out of the 8hr trial period.  I never said that.

Well worth a look -- but not quite the gift (for Radiance users) that  
it might have been.

I second John's evaluation of SketchUP. It is an amazing tool that
allows you to do pretty advanced 3D drawings in no time. Another caveat
for Radiance users: SketchUP geometries can have two different materials
attached to the two sides of a surface. When you export into Radiance
(via 3ds) the material attached to the front of the surface is exported.
This can lead to surprises so bear this 'feature' in mind when you set
up your SketchUP model. Also, do not make your material names in
SketchUP too long as the names will get cut to eight (?) characters in
the 3DS model.

I wonder if it would be possible to write a Radiance export plug-in  
for the free version of SketchUp.  By the way, the free version is  
not licensed for commercial use, so even if it had full export  
facilities, there would still be problems using it commercially;  
Google can afford lots of lawyers.  I wonder about research use.

It looks like sketchup is using opengl, so it could still be possible to
get the model
with a few efforts and text file editing using GLIntercept + OGLE

GLIntercept
http://glintercept.nutty.org/index.html

OGLE
http://ogle.eyebeamresearch.org/

I haven't tested it yet, so I can't promise it works ...

Good luck!

Why is the filter material not shiny?  Does it have a rough texture  
that scatters light?  If it is solid and transmits light, then it  
also reflects light.  It might have a low index of refraction if it  
is a gel filter, similar to water with n=1.3, whose surface  
reflection is around 2%.  You can give the index of refraction to the  
glass type as a fourth argument.  (If you give a value of 1.0, there  
will be no reflection at all.)

Whether you end up using 'glass' or 'trans' as your material, be sure  
to leave a small gap between the surface you use for your filter and  
the surfaces you use for your cylinder.  Otherwise, the rays will see  
one or the other surface at random.

If you're looking for a free modeling software that exports to Radiance 
there are several. Not as easy to use as Sketchup, mind you, but still, 
100% legal GPL 3D software is out there. And the 'full' version of 
Sketchup is $500, much cheaper than anything else.

Sketchup Pro uses Ruby as an API. So I don't see why someone wouldn't be 
able to make an export plug-in for it to talk with Radiance. Ruby is a 
great language, from what I've seen it a lot simpler than many other 
ones, and if I was a Sketchup user I think I'd dig into it. It looks 
like a lot of fun...

It works with Google Earth. It's a lot of fun. Takes a couple of tweaks 
to get it running, but once it is it's pretty fun to 'screenshot' 3D 
models out of it and pull them into modeling software. I've got all of 
downtown S.F. this way as a background model. It's a copyright 
nightmare, but really, really cool...

Yeah, looks interesting.  I assumed that the Ruby API would have been 
one of the things they crippled with the free version, but no, it's 
there!  =8-)  Problem is, what I do not see in there is the ability to 
set up object snaps, snap grids or direct coordinate input -- things I 
use all day long.  Bummer.  There is a user-definable coordinate system, 
but entity creation seems to be limited to drag & drop and some default 
object snaps (that are always running). 

Am I just missing something?

Message-ID: <cdf76d820604300018s52238d54wc25af91dc53b18@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I need to model my building with glazings (from the Viracon Insulating glass
list) with different visible transmittances such as 65%, 58%, 54% etc.

How do I obtain the RGB values based on the visible transmittances for each
glazing? Please help.

Regards,
Ramana.

Ramana,
For an accurate description of commercially available glazing types, you can
use the program Window from LBNL to export Radiance definitions.

Ramana,

You could also use Optics 5, also rom LBNL, which includes a huge  
database of commercial glazings (including Viracon) that you can  
easily export to Radiance format.  Window will allow you to create  
custom assemblies.

Here are some links:
http://windows.lbl.gov/materials/optics5/default.htm
http://windows.lbl.gov/software/window/window.html

John, I see you are now working at Atelier Ten in New York City?   
Cool!  You are only 12 blocks from my old office, and are _very_  
close to where I worked before that.  You are also dangerously close  
to Duke's, purveyors of excellent cajun food and weapons-grade  
margaritas.  That is a great neighborhood and I wish you the best of  
luck there. Say hi to Jochen for me.
