Subject: [Radiance-general] Sky brightness in the middle east
Message-ID: <20060801044444.24908.qmail@web54605.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi all,

Does anyone know, have any data, or know where I can
find data on sky brightness in the middle east,
specifically UAE, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar and Saudi?

Ideally, a frequency distribution of illuminances
would be great, or even just the illuminance values
for a 15%, 50% and 85% CIE design sky. 

Cheers

Nick

Nick-

Weather data for Abu Dhabi, UAE, and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, is available
from the EnergyPlus website:

http://www.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/cfm/weather_data2.cfm/re
gion=2_asia_wmo_region_2

There is a document that defines the fields in the data file under
'weather data format definition' link on the left side of the page.

These files contain hourly data, and usually have horizontal
illuminances and sky zenith luminance.

Regards,
Matt

Hello All,

I have used genbox to create a....box (obviously) and now want to change one side of it to act as the front of a display.(Im not interested in the detail of the display case, a simple box will do)
I know how to replace one of the polygons with a different material type but what does anyone recommend to use? I dont require the display to show any pictures, i just want it to have a uniform white light emitting from one side of 400 nits. Should i use an illum surface? How can i ensure it has the brightness i require??

Your reply email (below) and attachments to yuni has helped me some greg, i can now add pictures if i so wish, but not sure if it helps me with my above questions

my box is below, although im sure i havent needed to put it in.

thanks in advance 

chris

Hi Yuni,

Here is a description for an HP LCD monitor we measured at LBNL for  
the New York Times (work sponsored by NYSERDA).  You can substitute  
any 1024x768 screen shot you like for "VDTdisp.pic".  Make sure the  
maximum value is <= 1.0.

As for glare analysis, I don't know how you mean to associate  
discomfort glare with a VDT.  Perhaps you are thinking of veiling  
glare -- reflections from the screen that reduce visibility?

Hi Mark,

Thanks for sharing your files with me.  It seems that your light  
fixture has a very tight output distribution, which falls off  
dramatically to the left and right.  The more you subdivide the light  
source, the more accurate your results.  Your second Radiance result  
is the more accurate.  Apparently, AGI32 only sends a single sample  
to the center of the source, which is what you also get from Radiance  
with the default -ds 0.2.

I discovered this by looking up from your sample point 120 inches  
below the light source, which is itself 20 inches in diameter.  A  
perspective view shows that even at this distance, the fall-off is  
quite noticeable.

Bottom line, the rtrace -ds 0.1 result is more accurate.  Whew!

-Greg

Hi all,
   
  I am new to radiance. dunno much abt the commands. Interested to use vgaimage.
  I hav seen the example to use vgaimage:
   
  vgaimage render.pic
   
  but dun understand why vgaimage not recognized as internal or external command, operable program or batch file, when I try to run this.

I have to admit that I didn't even hear about this program before and I never noticed it in my /bin directory - although obviously there is a man-page for it on the web. 
If it's not there anymore it might have become obsolete - but I guess the developer(s) will have a more precise answer. 
If you are trying to view a Radiance *.pic file, I suggest you try out ximage which should always work on every *nix workstation that has X properly set up. On Windows systems you can use the precompiled Radiance binaries from Francesco Anselmo's website (http://www.bozzograo.net/radiance/ but there are other packages for this platform as well.

Greg,
 
I really appreciate you looking into this.  I was going to drop the -ds
parameter all together, confident with my AGI/Radiance check!
 
The light fixture in question is a sportslighting fixture for a hockey
rink.  There will be 200+ fixtures all aimed at slightly different
spots.  The fixtures as you mentioned have a very strong but also very
narrow distribution in one axis.  It sounds like I need to run a -ds
convergence checker at 100' to see what the largest value possible
should be to get accurate results.  (I typically do this for the ab
parameter only and just settle on some of the others based on rad's
output)
 
Does the size of the scene affect the -ds parameter?  My final scene
will be a large stadium.
 
Given this distribution, how will having an illum at each fixture
help/hurt renderings or point-by-point calculations?
 
Thank you for your guidance.
 
Mark

Hi Mark,

You can always experiment with smaller and smaller values of the -ds  
parameter, but I found that the convergence doesn't change much after  
-ds 0.1.  The size of the scene doesn't affect what -ds value will work.

Using an illum would not help in this case, as far as I can figure.

Hi Mark.
 
I don't know how your going to evaluate your model but if you're
calculating
illumination over an area or even falsecolor image I wouldn't worry much
about
the accurate contribution of one individual luminiare. You'll have
several luminiares
contributing at any given spot which should even out the computational
differences
of each luminaire.
 
Based on your description the -ds option will probably have no effect
anyway
because all your light sources are small in relation to their distance.
If you want
to compare results between different applications you'd have to setup
the same
model in each and run a standard (for each application) calculation.
This will
account for the different types of calculation methods (tracing vs.
radiosity)
and details (as the -ds effects).
 
Please note that I have seen a noticeable slowdown in my recent
calculations
of scenes with large numbers of light sources. If anyone has an idea how
to
optimise that it be great.  
 
 
Thomas

Hello again, 
 
Im making my own ies file for a spotlight i am using in a lab from data i found at the manufacturers website. i have a graph of angle against brightness and i know the format of such a file from readin RwR. however i can seem to find a description for some of the values needed, either in the book or in the online manuels
 
the file i have made so far looks as so, but the text in square brackets are the values im not sure of (ignore the oridnary parenthesis, i simply havent measured my spotlight yet.). i havent got access to the iesna standard and so was wondering if anyone on the list has knowledge of this area.
 
TILT=NONE
 
1 [lumens per lamp] [candela multiplier] 11 [photometric type] [units type] (w) (l) (h)
[ballast factor] 1 4000
0 0.5 1.5 3 4 5 6 7.5 9 11 17

i think that all the square bracket values have to be 1, but the one im most unsure of is the lumens per lamp value. this is most definately not 1, does anyone know what this is and how i calculate this for my spotlight??
 
thanks in advance, any help much appreciated as usual (wish i could give something back!).
 
Chris
 
p.s. still havent solved my last email either if anyone has any suggestions...

You can find the description of the IES file standard in the appendix of
this
document:
 
http://www.helios32.com/Thinking%20Photometrically%20II.pdf
 
PS: Did the manufacturer not offer IES files directly?
      Seems strange if they had the raw data.

Im making my own ies file for a spotlight i am using in a lab from data
i found at the manufacturers website. i have a graph of angle against
brightness and i know the format of such a file from readin RwR. however
i can seem to find a description for some of the values needed, either
in the book or in the online manuels
 
the file i have made so far looks as so, but the text in square brackets
are the values im not sure of (ignore the oridnary parenthesis, i simply
havent measured my spotlight yet.). i havent got access to the iesna
standard and so was wondering if anyone on the list has knowledge of
this area.
 
TILT=NONE
 
1 [lumens per lamp] [candela multiplier] 11 [photometric type] [units
type] (w) (l) (h)
[ballast factor] 1 4000
0 0.5 1.5 3 4 5 6 7.5 9 11 17
0
1880000 1800000 1600000 1000000 600000 400000 250000 120000 100000 60000
0
 
i think that all the square bracket values have to be 1, but the one im
most unsure of is the lumens per lamp value. this is most definately not
1, does anyone know what this is and how i calculate this for my
spotlight??
 
thanks in advance, any help much appreciated as usual (wish i could give
something back!).
 
Chris
 
p.s. still havent solved my last email either if anyone has any
suggestions...

Hi Thomas
 
Thanks for getting back to me, ill look on the website.
 
i havent actually contacted the manufacturer directly (its arri out of interest; http://www.arri.com/entry/lighting.htm), would be wise to but i thought i would learn more by making my own. They didnt have an ies file on the website that i could find, just this photometric data page. 
after looking at your suggested website (which is very good thankyou) the description of lumens per lamp isnt given by arri so i'll have to request an ies file afterall
 
Thanks again
 
Chris

Chris.
 
You can find the description of the IES file standard in the appendix of this
document:
 
http://www.helios32.com/Thinking%20Photometrically%20II.pdf
 
PS: Did the manufacturer not offer IES files directly?
      Seems strange if they had the raw data.

Hi Chris,

Arri doesn't provide IES or EULUMDAT data for their luminaires, but they 
have a photometric calculator on their website.
I measured four different types of luminaires for my thesis and created 
IES files, tell me which one you want, maybe i can help you.
Regards,

Christian

Hello Christian,

Thanks for getting back to me, much appreciated.

The photometric calculator (PC) Arri has looks nice but isnt really much help when trying to make an ies file. I have printed off a graph from the PC and have used a ruler to try and get some angle and brightness values for use in my ies file but it cant imagine that its very accurate.
The light i physical and want to model have is the ARRI Daylight Compact 4000W (not the theatre one) with a fresnal lens. HMI 4000 W/SE G38.
I want to model it in spot, midflood and flood focus range.

For my spot focus my draft ies looks as below

TILT=NONE

1 [lumens per lamp] 1 12 1 1 2 -.376 0 0 
1 1 4000
0 0.5 1.5 3 4 5 6 7.5 9 11 17 90
0
1880000 1800000 1600000 1000000 600000 400000 250000 120000 100000 60000 0 0

i dont know what value i should use for the lumens per lamp, any suggestions? from what you know am i doing anything else wrong??

Thanks for your time

Chris

If you know what kind of lamp you want to use, you can go to philips or ge's website and find the 
lamp there. They should have the mean and initial lumens listed that you can then put into your IES 
file. For the ballast factor, you can use 1, or you can go to a site like advancetransformer.com and 
find a ballast that will work with whatever lamp you've chosen and use that ballast factor (although 
generally you can find a ballast for your lamp that has whatever ballast factor you want, so you 
could probably just set this at whatever you want it to be).

Hi Chris,

You can use a simple "light" type, using 400/179 for the radiance value:

void light display_surface
0
0
3 2.2346 2.2346 2.2346

Then substitute this material for the appropriate face.  If you don't  
expect the display to illuminate surface more than a certain distance  
away -- say 20 in your world units, you can use a glow for higher  
efficiency

void glow display_surface
0
0
4 2.2346 2.2346 2.2346  20

Hope this helps.
-Greg

Hi Dave

yeah i know what type of lamp, it was in the last email i wrote to christian, its a 4000w fresnal lens spotlight from Arri. how do the mean and initial lumens value help me? do i use one of them in the 'lumens per lamp' value for the ies file

thanks chris

Chris,

Say you had an initial lumen value of 15,000lm for the lamp you've chosen. All you would have to do 
would be replace [lumens per lamp] with 15000. The mean lumens will be a lower value than the 
intital lumens. If you are using a light loss factor in your calculations, you should use one of the 
following combinations:

a) use the initial lumens in your IES file and use an appropriate value for the lamp lumen 
depreciation in your light loss factor (the lamp lumen depreciation value will depend on the lamp 
chosen)

b) use the mean lumens in your IES file and use a value of 1 for the lamp lumen depreciation in your 
light loss factor, since the mean lumens already take the lamp lumen depreciation into account.

Hope that helps!

Chris.
 
You need to get the terminology right:
 
The "lamp" you're describing is a "luminaire": the lamp
is the small glass bulb that's inside it. (Yes, we do this
on purpose to confuse people ;)
 
The lamp for your luminaire is indicated as 
 
HMI 4000 W/SE G38 
 
and is described here:
 
http://www.osram.com.ro/pdf/service_corner/technicalinfo/4000WSE_E.pdf
 
and gives you a modes 380000 lumens.
 
I suppose that's why the luminaires are called 'daylight'

Hi Dave

yeah i know what type of lamp, it was in the last email i wrote to
christian, its a 4000w fresnal lens spotlight from Arri. how do the mean
and initial lumens value help me? do i use one of them in the 'lumens

If you know what kind of lamp you want to use, you can go to philips or
ge's website and find the
lamp there. They should have the mean and initial lumens listed that you
can then put into your IES
file. For the ballast factor, you can use 1, or you can go to a site
like advancetransformer.com and
find a ballast that will work with whatever lamp you've chosen and use
that ballast factor (although
generally you can find a ballast for your lamp that has whatever ballast
factor you want, so you
could probably just set this at whatever you want it to be).

Hi Chris,

I believe the <lumens per lamp> field is used to calculate fixture
efficiency (notice it is lumens per lamp, not total fixture lumens). If
you are not concerned with fixture efficiency, put any value you like
there. Osram HMI 4000 W/SE has a total lumen output of 380,000 lm, if
you'd like to have a realistic number there anyway.

Most photometric viewers can calculate the lumens out of a fixture
easily. I plugged your file (with an arbitrary number in the lumens per
lamp field) into a program called Photometric Viewer (from Acuity
Brands) and it showed the fixture to output 37,982 lumens. Based on the
number of lumens coming out of the Osram lamp, that would be about a 10%
fixture efficiency. Seems low, but then again, I don't know what a 4000W
Metal Halide fixture looks like anyway.

Hope that helps.

Halley

Hi Chris, et al.:

Chris, the fresnel lens has nothing to do with the lamp.  Just want  
to be clear on that.  The lens is part of the luminaire itself and  
its behavior should be accounted for in the candela values you got  
from the website. Arri makes luminaires, not lamps.  (And that 4K  
fresnel is a kick-butt luminaire!!  I used their 2K spots in my  
theatre days; those 4K's must _really_ throw some light. The lamp  
socket for the 2K was nuts, with its own mechanical clamp that held  
it in place.  I still remember the lamp code: CYX.  Don't ask me why  
that tidbit remains in my brain sixteen years after the fact, when I  
can't even remember what I had for dinner last night.  Anyway...)

The lumens/lamp field really should contain the initial lumens of the  
lamp used in the luminaire when it was photometered, per the  
specification.  That's just good practice in case someone else ever  
uses that file and they have a different lamp; that way one can  
tailor the output to reflect a different lamp output using the  
multiplier (see below).  The fact of the matter is that in Radiance  
(and I'm pretty sure this is true of AGI as well), it really doesn't  
matter what you put in the lumens/lamp field in the ies file, as the  
candelas are what they are, regardless.  Like I said, it's just good  
practice to follow the spec.  That said, in Lightscape, if you  
changed the lumens in that field, you changed the output of the  
luminaire, but this is not really the way things are supposed to  
work.  That's what the multiplier is for.  The multiplier field  
allows you to adjust the luminaire output to reflect a different lamp  
output, as well as the effect of all the other elements that go into  
the Light Loss Factor (LLF).

This brings me to mean vs. initial.  Lamp catalogs usually have both  
values, the mean value quantifying the lamp's lumen depreciation over  
time.  It's nice to have both because then you can compute more  
accurate LLD multipliers (mean lumens/initial lumens=LLD), as they  
vary from lamp type to lamp type, and manufacturer to manufacturer.  
Of course LLD is only one element of the total LLF.

Note also that ies2rad has its own multiplier (-m), so you could  
leave the multiplier in the ies file at 1 and use the -m to apply  
your multiplier (this is what I do).

Hi all,

I've never had so many ppl help on a subject, thanks alot rob, halley, thomas, dave and christian. very much appreciated.

Dave and rob you both talk about a light loss factor, as a multiplier, i gather you mean the candela multiplier field in an ies file. no need to reply if im right...just please tell me if im wrong! i'll just leave this as 1 and then use the -m option if needed.

ill use the 380,000 lumens in my lumens per lamp value then, although by the sounds of things its not crucial what i use. 

thomas - i was aware that my terminology was mixed up, but now its not-thanks. got a copy of that lamp now thanks.

halley - i think that 38000 fixture output is a bit low, the efficiency should be higher.but ur information helped, thanks. 

rob - they do really throw out some light. from about 2m away we got about 100k lux. after using all of them (we have 5) for a couple of weeks some bright spark mentioned that we may be gettin a little bit too much UV so we had them tested. a single one from 2.5m away is above UV radiation safety standards after 20 mins, we had all 5 pointed at us from about 2m away, meaning we were only safe under their collective glare for 4 mins. we would spend all day under them......whoops. needless to say we installed some UV filters afterwards. yeah i presumed that the fresnal lens was taken into account already with the photometric data, dont know why i mentioned it really, but thanks anyway for confirming my suspicions ;)

so my 2 final ies file will look as below, 

spot.ies

TILT=NONE

1 1 4000

flood.ies

TILT=NONE

1 380000 1 14 1 1 2 -.376 0 0
1 1 4000
0 7 10 13 16 22 26 30 36 40 44 50 60 90

if anyone see's anything wrong with these please shout at me!

thanks enormously

Hi all,

Just to say thanks to everyone again, ive made and tested my ies file and it works! the illuminance values i get are slightly off from the real world measurements ive taken, but this can easily be recitified with changing my guestimates from the photometric data. wahoo!

just measured the light in real world rob, at a distance of 3.5m i got an illuminance value of 145,500 lux max. its quite hot standing there let me tell ya!

Dear Greg,
  Greetings!
  I have two questions. First, does rpict involve any tonemapping
procedure?  In other words, does the .pic file contain the original
data without any tonemapping? Second, I rendered the same input files
with the same rendering parameters using the "rad" comman complied
from the same version of Radiance on a mac and a linux machine. I got
different .pic files. Not only the images look different ( the
highlight on one sphere look brighter), but the .pic values are
different.  I wonder why this happened. Has anyone experience this?


Thanks for the advice,

Bei

Hi Bei,

Rpict doesn't do any tone-mapping on its output -- what you get are  
in fact the radiometric values in a floating-point image format.   
Pcond or normtiff can be used for tone-mapping.

The differences between machines may be due to variations in the  
random number generator.  If you set -ps 1, I expect your results  
will look more similar, though they still won't be an exact match.

hi all

anyone who feels the need can answer this question but i think greg might know the answer after readin one of his previous emails. 

greg, you including an email with a file for a LCD display on an email to yuni previously, with a hack in it to give the glowing screen some reflectance...helps but i need some more , please!!

i want to shine light onto an ON display and measure the combined light reflecting off of it. this has to include the reflected light and the transmitted light of the display itself. how do i achieve this?

im comfortable with using rcalc|rtrace|rcalc and bgraph so i dont need any help there. i require some assistance with the materials for the display. i currently have the material LIGHT emitting from one side of the display, would it be wise to put in GLASS in front of this light? can i model this glass so that it transmittes the light coming from behind it (from the display) and at the same time reflects the light incident on it from the front, from the spotlights.

hope that was easy enough to follow. i feel brtd func would be more appropiate than glass but would appreciate any one's thoughts. 

thanks in advance

chris

Hi Chris.

Because no one answered this so far I will step in with
my limited knowledge and experience about materials:

You definitively want to combine your light material with
something in front of it as "light" (or "glow" as far as
it matters) has no reflectance and no transmittance. Nothing
will reflect off a "light" and nothing will shine through.
The 'shine through' is what "illum" was designed for.

'glass' as a reflector would certainly be possible but it
is not the best choice. Even if there are still glass-screened
displays around they would probably be treated with some
sort of coating to avoid reflections which the 'glass' material
does not account for.

I'd try a 'trans' material with a very high transmittance
(similar to glass) and nearly no diffuse component. This
gives you the possibility to tweak the reflectance to something
similar to a LCD screen. I don't know what their physical
reflectance value is in reality I just know that I can't read
my screen at work sometimes because I've the window in my
back.

Reading the above you might just want to simulate the
glare effect of a point light source on your screen.
Then a 'mirror' type material may be your friend. Just
use your 'light' material as modifier of the mirror for
non source rays:

void light display_light
0
0
3 2.23 2.23 2.23

void mirror display_surface
1 display_light
0
3 0.8 0.8 0.8

(example for something with 80 % reflectance).

You can't change the surface finish, though.

Thanks to Thomas for offering that thoughtful reply.  I'm a little  
swamped at the moment...  The files I gave to Yuni under the subject  
"glare on monitor screen" a couple weeks ago are the best I have to  
offer at the moment.  Note that I used a "mixfunc" type to get the  
diffuse, specular, and emission to happen together in one material.   
The "glass" isn't really appropriate, for the reasons Thomas  
mentioned among others.

Subject: [Radiance-general] filtering normal information from an obj
Message-ID: <44DAEBB8.5020707@gmx.net>

Hi!

As obj2mesh doesn't support something as obj2rad's -f option to filter 
surface normal information, and mgffilt cannot be used here because 
native radiance-format is not involved using obj2mesh (well, I could use 
obj2rad -f and than the new rad-to-obj filter, but that does not seam to 
make sense to me with all my large files), I wonder how people get rid 
of normals if needed.

I started with grep -v "vn", but that only removes the vertices, not 
their referneces in the face (f) lines. So I need a sed-command maybe, 
that finds the normal vertex reference by examining the /-seperated 
triples in lines beginning with f and replace the normal vertex index by 
0. And it should take care of lines that are continued after a line 
break, indicated by a backslash, as that seams to be valid in obj.

I am not very good in sed. If someone has a tested sed-string (I guess 
so) it would be great if you could post it, might be of general 
interest. If not, I will have to think myself ;-) and make hundreds of 
failed attempts to get this done...

Thanks... Lars.

Just a short question about the whole surface / vertex normal topic... I 
guess the normal interpolation is effective only in the direct 
calculation, right? So I should not expect too much performance gain 
from removing it, only rpict occupying some fewer bytes, right?

THis may not be the most elegant solution, but if you want more  
control over how your .obj files are structured, give the utility  
UVMapper a try:

http://www.uvmapper.com/

It is available for Windows and Mac and the "Classic" version is free  
(at least for the Mac).  You can load your obj into UVMapper and then  
export it with or without normals, UVs, Regions, etc.

If you have a lot of obj's this may not be the greatest solution, but  
try it out.  This is a must have if you model in Lightwave and export  
your models in obj format and you WANT normals, because LW does not  
export normal info.

Hi Kirk,

thank you, but the task is to (optionally) switch off normal processing 
in a script. It is about some dozens or maybe hundreds of obj's. I hope 
to improve processing speed in radiance, but I do not really want to 
delete the normals from the obj-Model, as they fit quite well.

Lars.

Hi Lars,

You can try it, but if your purpose is to reduce rendering times, I  
don't expect you'll see much difference from taking the surface  
normals away.  The implementation of normal interpolation in Radiance  
meshes is fairly efficient.

I also wrote a utility for manipulating .OBJ files (a bit), but it  
was written under contract with someone else and depends on some  
other code I developed that isn't part of Radiance.  I could  
distribute binaries, but compiling under multiple architectures is  
beyond my abilities right now.

Here's a simple try:

grep -v '^vn' file.obj | sed -e 's|\([0-9]*/[0-9]*/\)[0-9]*|\1|g'

Seems to work ok on an OBJ file produced with Wings3D. As far as I know,
only the face lines have slashes in them, so you don't have to match for
the 'f' at the beginning of the line or do anything special for broken
lines. Can line breaks occur in the middle of a v/vt/vn triplet? That
would be the only problem with my solution. The next step then would be a
Perl script...

Hi Mark,

There is no explicit setting for the lower limit, but you can use the  
-log option to falsecolor to specify a number of decades between the  
top and bottom of the range, and this number can be anything.  So, if  
you want a minimum that is 15 and a maximum of 2000, you would specify:

	-s 2000 -log 2.125

Since log10(2000) - log10(15) is 2.125.

Make sense?

Yes, it seams to work here, too. Thank you! I will do some more serious testing with my obj's tomorrow.

Hi all.

Im back with my spotlights again im afraid. Im havin immense trouble rotating them so that they face the same way. i have tried using a range of values for rx ry and rz in my xform command and keep gettin odd results. instead of rotating my spot they seem to actually move it.

this is incredible frustrating! my xform file is below.

# move display into place

!xform -n display -t 2.4 7 2 display2.rad

# move 3 spotlights into rear of room

!xform -n spot1 -t 1.25 1 3.8 (-rx -ry -rz being used here) spotc.rad

!xform -n spot2 -t 2.5 1 3.8 (-rx -ry -rz being used here) spotc.rad

!xform -n spot3 -t 3.75 1 3.8 (-rx -ry -rz being used here) spotc.rad

my spotlight dimensions

	0 0 -0.00025
	0 0 -1
	0 0.15

i have tried this for a couple of days now and it is beginnin to get my goat. i want them in the same position as in the translate command, just pointing in a different direction. the spotlights defualt is aimed vertical down and i am trying to get them to aim about 45-60 degrees from the horizontal as well as all converged to one point (the display). can anyone please help in this matter before i throw my computer out the window...(probably just throw myself though as the computer can only do what i tell it!)

thanks in advance.

Rotate first, then translate to your preferred position.

Hi Chris,

If you change the order you write the translation/rotation commands in
xform it should solve the problem...
 
The IES file is inserted at XYZ co-ordinate 0,0,0. With your command
you've translated it approx 1m from 0,0,0 and then rotated it in a big
arc around 0,0,0.

!xform -n spot1 -t 1.25 1 3.8 (-rx -ry -rz being used here) spotc.rad

...and it disappears out of your view (zoom out and you'll probably find
it somewhere!)


The answer is to rotate the luminaire first and then place it in
position i.e.
 
!xform -n spot1 (-rx -ry -rz being used here) -t 1.25 1 3.8 spotc.rad

Hope this helps
Richard

Hi Chris,

A rotation in Radiance is always done using 0 0 0 as the anchor point 
for the rotation.

I cannot see your scene from here, but if you rotate after a certain 
translation, you might get odd results.
I think you should rotate your spot first (and before that make sure its 
anchorpoint of rotation is located at 0 0 0) and then move it.
so, as an example:

!xform -n spot1 -rx 90 -ry 0 -rz 0 -t 1.25 1 3.8  spotc.rad

should work fine
(instead of: !xform -n spot1 -t 1.25 1 3.8 -rx 90 -ry 0 -rz 0  spotc.rad 
which is NOT the same )

Consider using replmarks also (see the manpage) , which works also OK 
for aiming light geometry in a proper direction (and position).
Good luck,

Iebele

As Francesco pointed out - you're rotating after translating. The rotations
are always performed around the origin (0,0,0). If the object isn't centred
on the origin (as it might not be after a translation) then you'll get
additional "movement". Imagine your lights being on the end of an
imaginary pole that you're swinging about.

Hope this helps,
bye

1) triangle must be rectangle, the longer leg is the X axis and with the 90? corner in 0,0,0. 

2) add to the triangle a line pointing in the main photometric axis

3) displace and rotate the triangle by the 90? corner, copy freely where you wish and use the line to understand where are they looking at.

4) save the file as a radiance file and note the modifier of the triangles, that ideally is the same for all of them (assuming you are placing 1 type of light)

now use:

5) replmarks -x the-object-to-copy.rad modifier-name the-file-with-the-triangles > the-file-with-the-light-in-place

the only variant is to use -i instead of -x but this applies to instances and therefore not good for your task (lights) since instances cannot have light inside.

hope this is a quick hands on,

for further information man replmarks will help :-)

ciao

G.

Hi all.
 
I'll step in on this:
 
The basics are spelled out in the man page of  'replmarks'
(not 'xform' as Giulio wrote).  He has explained the usage
himself in the meantime. Just two things to note:
 
1) Check the orientation of the lumiaire or box created by ies2rad.
    For linear luminaires the 'main luminous axis' runs right across,
    not along the luminare. If you have a fitting for a 35 W fluorescent
    tube (about 1.5m long) it will extend from y=-0.75 to y=0.75 while
    the x dimension may only be 0.1 m. The replmark marker therefore
    is orthogonal to the luminare body.
 
2) Photometric files are usually created with the luminaire pointing
    down, even if the fitting is intended and constructed to light up a
wall.
    Check a photometic plot and decide wether you have to turn around
    the luminaire.
 
Thomas

Thanks for your help fran, guilio ian richard iebele(<---hope i havent missed anyone out), much appreciated. 

Next time i should really try changin the order of the commands rather than just banging my head against a brick wall for two days....headache abound. It works now, of course, and i have my spotlights aimed. thankyou thankyou thankyou

I just saw this announcement about a new Nvidia graphics card.

http://www.gwn.com/news/story.php/id/10042/

At $18,000 it is a bit out of my price range but it begs the  
question, would it be possible to harness the horsepower of such a  
card to render Radiance scenes in realtime?

Thought I'd share the progress on out art studio addition. Still in
progress, but I have some QTVR movies of the interior.

Hi, far from being an expert, at least I have a history of asking such 
questions on the list (remember my cell-processor thread) ;-)

So the little I understood is as follows:

1) It needs double(!) precision power, while most of these 3d 
accelerations give mainly single fp and integer performance.

2) It is hard to do the calcution as implemented in Radiance on many 
processing units parallel. So if the card has ONE processor that is so 
powerful, one could try to push the code to that core. Most cards are 
based on multi-cpu or core designs, and than it will be hard to use 
them. The problem is that one pixel traced results in a "tree" of 
pixels, with an unknown number of leaves. So e.g. calculating simply 8 
pixels at once would result in an unknown number of parallel calculations.

For 2), I think one might still try to port a complete rpict to the 
instruction set of the processing units and do parallel processing as on 
SMP machines, at least with e.g. a cell architecture. But than till 1) 
is not solved.

So I doubt that this card will help you much in Radiance. Of course with 
rad -ogl or rshow...

CU Lars.

Sure.  Write a C compiler for the card, port Linux to it, then  
compile Radiance on there.  Should be a snap!

Not knowing anything about GPUs I ran your response by a researcher  
at Nvidia.

 From David Luebke, research at  Nvidia.

Perhaps not all that practical after all. But it never hurts to ask.

Take care,

I was joking!

Nice of David to write such a cogent reply...

Joking? Whoops. Time to call the credit card company and take 
back that $18,000.
