Subject: [Radiance-general] dulux conversion
Message-ID: <10230.213.58.97.67.1152183455.squirrel@webmail1.londonmet.ac.uk>

Hi all,

I was wondering if anybody has info on converting Dulux colour to RADIANCE
RGB or some other system.

Example: 50RR 19/203

with 50RR: hue, 19: LRV (light reflectance value), 203: chroma.

Dulux seem to have changed their colour notation recently. It used to be
somewhat similar to NCS, but it's different now. The info on the pack of
swatches I have here lists the hues as:

RR: Magenta through to Red
YR: Red through to Orange
YY: Orange through to Green
GY: Green through to Turquoise
BG: Turquoise through to Blue
BB: Blue through to Violet
RB: Violet through to Magenta

If I assume that lime is 1/2 Y with 1/2 G on the NCS circle, violet is 1/3
blue with 2/3 red, and magenta is 2/3 blue with 1/3 red, then YY would
cover a whopping 90 deg on the NCS hue circle, but BB, RB, and RR only 30
deg. That doesn't look right.

A (not particularly accurate) representation of the NCS circle is in
chapter 1, page 29 of SynthLight:
http://www.learn.londonmet.ac.uk/packages/synthlight/handbook/index.html

Dulux have also changed the chroma part of their notation from 2 to 3 digits.

Thanks for your time.

Axel

is there a place to find some samples or examples ?

I'm looking for a simple residential home maybe a couple
trees in the yard, and then create a picture with the
sun on a particular date. Eventually a time compressed
movie of the sun over a year.

Hi Pete!

Did you take a look at the example scenes coming with radiance? They are
located in the obj-directory if you downloaded the sources (are they in
the binaries?). There are also scenes in the ftp-directories which you
can find on radsite.lbl.gov.

If you want something REALLY simple, either go through the manual that
comes with radiance or set up a room in your favorite modeler.

Good luck, and feel free to ask! Lars.

Hi folks,

one minor info about radiance-online itself:

Six years after I started radiance-online, the configuration is about to 
change.

Flashback: It had started as an unofficial guerilla project in 2000, 
filling the void of a mailing list and a maintained website. Over the 
years, it grew to support the CVS software archive, hosted the Radiance 
mailing list with around 300 users and distributed the CDs of the past 
Radiance workshops. My idea had been to run a stable, no nonsense 
system: The system has been kept updated, and thanks to RAID, it 
survived two dying disks on the last 2 months without downtime. Various 
backups and self checks helped to make sure the source code distribution 
and the mailing list system remained consistent. And -yes, - many thanks 
to the IT at Fraunhofer ISE Freiburg for providing bandwidth (see 
http://www.radiance-online.org/webalizer/stats/ for details) and 
rackspace generously.

During the past months, it became obvious that new features would be 
useful. However, I didn't feel it would be wise for me to broaden my 
free support for it by a large scale, and trying to locate co-funding 
was fruitless. Which I found a bit sad, and, IMHO, may correlate with 
the management structure of Radiance.

Anyway- The domain registration expires next week, so I wrote to the dev 
list in May that I plan to "pass on the torch". Ideas then popped up on 
the dev list and LBNL (Lawrence Berkeley Nat. Lab., Greg Ward's employer 
when he wrote the legacy parts of Radiance) suggested to take over. They 
contacted me yesterday for the domain transfer, so we'll go ahead as 
planned. Which, in some ways, seems a good thing to me, as it will merge 
everything back in one place. And I'm glad we found a reasonable 
solution which allows me to focus back on what I want and need to do: 
optical material measurements.

So, with the old machine being shut down in the next weeks, and the new 
one being set up, you may experience some transitional problems. My 
apologies for any inconvenience this may cause.

Many thanks to all the folks who, by their email or code contributions, 
enhanced Radiance, smoothed the way for newcomers, located problems and 
made the Radiance community a lively place.
Also many thanks to Danny Fuller at LBNL (Windows&Daylighting) for 
taking over the system administration.

regards and happy rendering
Peter Apian-Bennewitz

Im following RwithR book and am attempting to do scene 2. On pages 161 and 163 of the book (I am trying to make some spotlights for the art gallery) it mentions that the IES photometric files i need are on the website. I cant find them! Can someone tell me where there are please.

I thought i had all the support files downloaded alreayd when i got radiance but as i did a file search and i didnt come up with anything, obviously not.

Thanks

I do not have the book here now, which IES files are you searching for, 
what are their names? They SHOULD even be in the sources-directory of 
the Radiance distribution, at least there are lots of maybe other IES 
files. CU Lars.

Hi Chris,

Did you have a look already at the book website:

http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/book/

?

I think you should download this tarball:
 
http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/book/ch3/scene2.tar.Z

Otherwise you can try fancier spotlights from different
lighting manufacturers:
iGuzzini, Erco, Zumtobel directly provide IES files ...

Cheers,

Francesco

Hello Chris.
 
You don't need exactly the IES files mentioned in the book.
You can get them from any manufacturer from their website.
 
You just have to figure out how the navigation of the catalogues
and download of the IES files work ...
 
The results you will get will differ from the results of the book,
so you can't check your procedures against the book.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Colordata question!
Message-ID: <44C4A66C.7030006@bankerinter.net>

Hi,

I have rectangular surface with sensor points organized as a regular 2D
grid. The color of each sensor is defined based on sun exposure data, I
calculate separately (some kind of false-color). With this data I can 
create an image with the surface and sensors on it, where color of 
sensors define the distribution of sun exposure on the surface.
Now, I want to make this representation continual (like the results of
falsecolor program), so I must somehow interpolate the color data from
the sensor points.
My idea is to define the rectangular surface near the original one, made
of plastic with colordata pattern. Colordata takes next form:
mod colordata id
7+n+
rfunc gfunc bfunc rdatafile gdatafile bdatafile
funcfile x1 x2  transform
0
m A1 A2 .. Am

rdatafile gdatafile bdatafile will be defined with my sensor colors.

How should I define rfunc, gfunc, bfunc to enable bilinear or bicubic 
interpolation of color?


Related question:
Are there any example of coloradata definition? I tried to find them in 
the Book and in mail archives, but without success!


Thanks,
Marija

Hi Everybody,

I have an aim to find out the luminance of the sun after it hits a perfect diffuser. I'm sure i have done this the very long way round, but at least this step by step way i understand what is going on.

I have used gensky to create a sun, and have created a sky and a ground (see bottom).

Aside question- the default for meridian using gensky is -120, and as im in london i have put my meridian to 0. this seems to give me a negative azimuth angle for my early morning sun and a positive for my afternoon sun. this means that the sun is rising in the west and setting in the east....im sure its the other way round?????????? the first four lines of the 10am automatically generated gensky file can be seen below
# gensky 07 24 10 -a 52 -o 2 -m 0 +s
# Local solar time: 9.76
# Solar altitude and azimuth: 48.8 -52.0
# Ground ambient level: 18.3

I have created different files for the sun throughout one day, started and finishing at 7, so that i have 13 different sun's.
I have then oconv each file to my material file, found a nice view directly at the sun for each time in rview and then rendering the image in rpict and finally pcond each image with a -h- option to get a good exposure level. So i have 13 images all looking directly at the sun. When i then click on a point and press l it gives me a value for (i think????) luminance. 

I now want to place a perfect diffuser with a normal pointed directly at the sun in each of these 13 positions and measure the illuminance reflecting off of the diffuser. My big question is, how do i orientate the diffuser so that it is normal to the sun each time, and any recommendations as to what material/values i should make the diffuser from??

Hello to everyone
I never wrote in here before cause all my questiond found an answer in the
archives
but not this time.

I lost a source 3d file of an old project, I have only in radiance format
(and then mgf format)
now I need it to inset it in a bigger project of the same place, but I need
to have it at first
in 3ds/dxf/vrml or whatever known format to place it correctly in the new
project.

I tryed to convert it in mgf format with rad2mgf and it seems correct (I've
checked it with a mgf viewer)
but if I tryed to convert it into vrml vith mgf2inv (with the -vrml option)
evey vrml viewer tell me the vrml file is wrong.

Anyone has an idea? Any help is welcome

Thanks all

Cristiano

Hi Chris.
 
I never checked the angles gensky prints but I remember that Radiance
understands "+" as west and "-" as east. (Remember that it was written
in and for America and it's always good for your ego to have a "+"
associated
with you ;) So the output should be fine. You can check the output of an
hourly
cycle to see how the value changes.
 
Your main problem can be solved by using a file with the diffuser as a
vertical
plane at a position "south" of the origin and "!xform" it into place
with the altitude
and azimuth as arguments for the "-ry" and "-rz" options:
 
!xform -ry <altitude*-1> -rz <azimuth*-1> diffuser.rad
 
The order of -ry and -rz is important!  
 
To model the "perfect diffuser" have a look at Schorsch excelent
explanation
of the trans material at
 
http://www.schorsch.com/rayfront/manual/transdef.html
 
If I understand you right you want a material with 100 % diffuse
transmittance.
I'm not sure Radiance does this correctly as it is physically imposible
but it's
worth a try.
 
Have fun,
Thomas

Hi Christiano.
 
If you have only the geometry you want in one or more
files then you don't need to read them into a modeller to
use them in Radiance. Just create a triangular marker in
your modeller and use !replmarks to replace it with
the contents of the file.
 
If you know where this file will be in your new project
you could use "!xform" as well. But this requires that
you have to work out position and rotation before.
 
If it's not urgent for you you can also wait until I am motivated
to include my old scene file parses in my Blender interface.
Blender has a 3ds exporter but I don't know much about the
quality of the files it creates. And your geometry should only
be triangles or my scripts would ignore it.
 
For now I'd look into xform or replmarks.   
 
Thomas

Hello to everyone
I never wrote in here before cause all my questiond found an answer in
the archives
but not this time.
 
I lost a source 3d file of an old project, I have only in radiance
format (and then mgf format)
now I need it to inset it in a bigger project of the same place, but I
need to have it at first
in 3ds/dxf/vrml or whatever known format to place it correctly in the
new project.
 
I tryed to convert it in mgf format with rad2mgf and it seems correct
(I've checked it with a mgf viewer)
but if I tryed to convert it into vrml vith mgf2inv (with the -vrml
option) evey vrml viewer tell me the vrml file is wrong.
 
Anyone has an idea? Any help is welcome
 
Thanks all

Ciao Cristiano,

If I understand well, you need to recover your lost 3d model in a usable
format from a .rad file.

You can try to use this little python script I've just written and added
to my website:
http://www.bozzograo.net/radiance/modules.php?op=modload&name=Downloads&file=index&req=getit&lid=17
to convert it to obj (no materials yet, sorry!)

I hope you may find it useful.

Cheers,

Francesco

There is also a program distributed with Radiance called mgf2inv,  
which takes an MGF (which can be generated from Radiance using  
rad2mgf) and converts it to VRML.

You may need to dip into the ray/src/cv/mgflib directory and run  
"make mgf2inv" to create it.

Hi Marija,

If you use the default "red" "green" and "blue" functions for rfunc,  
gfunc, and bfunc, you will get a bilinear interpolation by default.   
It may not look very nice, though, as bilinear interpolations tend to  
show "mach band" artifacts.  A simpler approach would be to convert  
your data into a low-resolution image then upsample it with pfilt.   
The conversion can be done using pvalue.

Sorry -- I should have offered an example.  Say you have a 10x15 grid  
of color values, given as ASCII triples like:

1.3871 3.8183 2.1783
(continue for another 149 values)

And the ordering corresponds to left-to-right, top-to-bottom (English  
text) organization.  To convert this to a smooth 1000x1500 picture,  
you could use:

% pvalue -r -h -Y 15 +X 10 -d data.txt | pfilt -1 -x 1000 -y 1500 -r .

Hi!

> There is also a program distributed with Radiance called mgf2inv,
[...]

I think that is what Christiano tried. There are two point to consider
using mgf2inv. The first is, that it creates vrml-1. There are very few
programs reading vrml-1 worlds in our days, most vrml-parsers support
vrml-2 (aka vrml-97), and all development work goes to x3d. The second
is that I experienced problems with the notation used for floating
points in mgf2inv's output. That can be solved with some
printf-formatting strings. Note that mgf2inv uses a floating point that
conforms to the standard. Still, e.g. when I tried to import into formZ,
I had to change it. If you use those old vrml-1 parsers, be prepared to
find lots of bugs - most of these vrml-1 parsers have been more or less
neglected for years. You know that Blender reads vrml-1? Just break your
scene into parts, because Blender does not like to import very complex
scenes at once sometimes. And keep your units so that dimensions are not
exceedingly big or small.

Francesco, if you really managed to write an obj output-filter, that
would be GREAT!!!! Will have a look at it tomorrow. This would be my
prefered choice!

CU Lars.

Hi Tom,

Thanks for your help. The angles thing has sorted itself out now. I thought i read somewhere that east of south was positive, but obviously not! From my results it makes sense if it were your way.

I near enough did what you recommended already, but i dont think i clarified what i wanted judging by your response.

>>If I understand you right you want a material with 100 % diffuse transmittance.

I am after a material with 100% diffuse reflectance

My material,reflector.rad

void plastic reflector_mat
0
0
5 1 1 1 0 0 

reflector_mat ring reflector
0
0
8 0 0 0
  0 -1 0
  5 0

An example of one of my xforms,

!xform -n reflector -t 0 0 10 -rz 38 -rx -48.8 reflector.rad

These angles are following the azimuth and altitude of the sun, i used rz and rx because of the way my ring was made. I have made my plastic material with a 0,0 spec and roughness value to get a perflectly reflecting diffuse surface (r,g,b are 1,1,1). Im now aim to look directly at my surface and measure the luminance from it.
  
There isnt really a question in this email, just thought id reply to yours, thanks for your help!

Chris.
 
Glad you solved your problem, sort of.
 
I just want to add one comment:
 
If you add the "-i" switch to rpict/rtrace the surface properties
for the last bounce will be replaced with a Lambertian surface
which is what you are looking for (completely diffuse reflection).
 
For you it might be the simplest solution to do an irridience
calculation with only one bounce. The real properties of the
diffuser (your plastic definition) don't make any difference then.
 
For an illustration of this see the color prints of the reception
desk in RwR (plate 15).
 
Thomas

Whoops -- that's what I get for not reading e-mails carefully.   
Cristiano's e-mail arrived in such a tiny font that I could scarcely  
read it, though.  That's my excuse, and I'm sticking to it.

I also naively thought that VRML-2 would be upwards compatible with  
VRML-1.  And I hadn't heard about the problems with floating point  
values before.  I should probably look into VRML-2 at some point.  In  
a parallel universe, I'm sure I have time for that.

Dear all
Thanks a lot for the fast reply

In particular thanks to Francesco cause he undestood exactly which was my
probelm
and gave me the right solution.
I've downloaded rad2obj.py and a python release for windows: it worked
great! thank a lot!!

Obviously i my definitive radiance project I will call with xform the
original radiance model
(with materials and luminaires), but to undestand where and how I have to
place it in the new
bigger project, it was absolutely necessary to have it in a common format,
and obj is really good
(then converted into 3ds to insert it my CAD 3D project).

Anyway thanks again to all that replyed so soon


Cristiano


PS. : if Francesco agrees, I'd like to get in touch directly with him to
talk a little...

I wonder how to model the monitor screen in radiance (what material, what reflectance?) and what glare assessment should be used (dgi?ugr?cie?or others?)
   
  Thank you very much. I really appreciate your help.
   
  Best regards,
   
  Yuni

Hi Yuni,

Here is a description for an HP LCD monitor we measured at LBNL for  
the New York Times (work sponsored by NYSERDA).  You can substitute  
any 1024x768 screen shot you like for "VDTdisp.pic".  Make sure the  
maximum value is <= 1.0.

As for glare analysis, I don't know how you mean to associate  
discomfort glare with a VDT.  Perhaps you are thinking of veiling  
glare -- reflections from the screen that reduce visibility?

-Greg

Hi Greg,
   
  thank you for your quick reply and your attached LCD info.
   
  Yes correct, I am thinking of veiling glare on the screen that will reduce visibility. Before I received your email, I tried mirror as LCD material. Surely, there is glare (as shown in file.pic), but when I calculate all glare parameter in radiance (dgi, ugr, cie, and others) the results are 0. May be those parameter cannot be used to calculate veiling glare on monitor screen? (high contrast occur vertically on the screen)
   
  Thank you very much, Greg.
   
  Best regards,
   
  Yuni

Maybe we meet in the parallel universe, where our parallel egos have
plenty of spare time and money, on a nice sunny beach studying the
irradiance... ;-) Ok, in fact I described the problem some time ago
here, but I would agree that there are more important features than
vrml-export filters. Actually, my experiments with converting radiance's
scene language into xml using xslt's were a step to get models OUT of
radiance, e.g. to (the xml-coded) x3d. I just never managed to write a
x3d-output stylesheet. I'm sure I did in one of the parallel universes.

However, my point is that in 2006, I would not spend time on a vrml-2
filter, but, if I had, on x3d. It is really close to vrml, but cleaner
and all development power at web3d is going there.

Now I have to hurry, my train to Ankara won't wait, and I have to be
there tomorrow morning. CU Lars.

Message-ID: <CC0B19F4C6132F4D9FDDEBF194200FB5013F5C2B@ldcexc02.global.arup.com>

just to double check...

what happens if I have a glow or light  material on a surface and I
switch between illuminance and luminance calculation (rvu or rpict), 

Are the numbers going to change (from cd/sqm to lx) or are still the
same on the surface?

 

I would expect that if I have 100cd/sqm I would get 314lx and to see the
number change.

BUT It doesn't seem to work this way, in fact the number still is 100...

I tried with rvu and the -i option do not affect this...

 

I am thinking of a typical application where to save time and energy you
just stick a glow to a surface that has a known average illuminance and
it is lambertian... not terribly accurate but FAST. 

The results would look odd to me: the illuminance map would have a
1/3.14 reduction for the values on the glowing surface...

Is this ok?

 

Ciao

Hi Guilio,

The -i option to rpict/rtrace only affects opaque, reflective  
materials.  It does not change the results for light sources or glow  
surfaces, or glass for that matter.

Hi Yuni,

Discomfort glare and reflected glare off a VDT screen are very  
different, which is why using findglare doesn't tell you anything.   
The contrast lost on a VDT due to reflected glare is a little tricky  
to measure, and there are no corresponding standards.  You can think  
of the contrast as the difference between the foreground and the  
background divided by the adaptation luminance (usually the same the  
background):

	Contrast = (L_fore - L_back)/L_back

Since reflected glare increases foreground and background equally,  
the new contrast becomes:

	Contrast_veil = (L_fore - L_back)/(L_back + L_veil)

The larger the veiling luminance, the lower the contrast.  Does this  
make sense?

Hi Greg,
   
  Thank you for your quick reply. 
  I see, so I could not use "findglare". 
   
  is L_fore the luminance of the monitor screen? is L_back the luminance of the surroundings? So you suggest to compare brightness of the monitor screen against brightness of the surrounding?it that so,what contrast level is acceptable?
   
  However, usually, veiling glare on monitor screen causes very bright portions on the screen that the display on the monitor cannot be seen anymore. Isn't it a brightness comparison between areas on the monitor screen it self (instead of brightness comparison between the screen and the surrounding). Or is it not a matter of brightness comparison, instead it is a matter of too much luminance on the screen that we cannot see clear image anymore? If that so, how to get the luminance values occured on the screen (besides the iso contour and false color, because they dont really show value)?

  Many thanks, Greg.
   
  Best regards,
   
  Yuni

Sorry, I should have explained better.  L_fore is the luminance of  
the character or whatever it is you are trying to read.  L_back is  
the luminance of the surround -- on the monitor, not behind it.   
L_veil is the *additional* luminance caused by unwanted reflection  
off the screen.  You may have to render the monitor with it switched  
off to get this value.  You can use the attached VDToff.rad file for  
this.  You'll also need the other files I've attached, which I forgot  
in the first posting.

Hi Greg,
   
  Thank you for your very quick reply.
   
  I am affraid I cannot understand how to use those files you sent. I am not that advance. I have build a plane as my monitor screen. I dont know how to apply material for this plane. Could you please kindly explain how to apply them in this monitor screen plane?
   
  Many thanks,

problems with the Isocontour image.

What are the series of commands that I need to use to create the Iso from
the HDR? I know that I need to create an Illumination file and then
composite that file with the original HDR. How do I do this? I am guessing
it will be 2 different terminal commands.

Any help will be greatly appreciated. I am sorry if this is a simple
problem, I am not a Radiance user so a lot of stuff is greek to me.

Thanks in advance,

Hi Matt,

The falsecolor command will create iso lines using the -cl or -cb  
options.  Try the following sequence:

% rpict -x 512 -y 512 [view and other options] input.oct > rendering.pic
% rpict -i -x 512 -y 512 [same options] intput.oct > luximage.pic
% falsecolor -cl -s 1000 -i luximage.pic -p rendering.pic | ra_tiff -  
contours.tif

You'll need to play with the falsecolor options to get it like you  
want.  See <http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/man_html/falsecolor. 
1.html> for details.

Greg,

Thanks so much for you very fast reply. All of the commands look simple
enough. My question now is, what is the .oct file and how do I create it? I
have been given a series of .HDR images that were created using PhotoSphere
from a series of shots. What do I need to do to convert this to a .oct file
or do I just substitute my .hdr file where you indicate .oct.

Again, I apologize if this a stupid question.

Thanks for your help.

Matt

Hi Matt.

Answering for Greg here as he may be sound asleep in
another part of the world.

Greg assumed that you had a 3D scene in Radiance format
from which the HDR images have been generated. So his
answer was to use that scene (the input.oct file) to
create a "luximage.pic" from the same viewpoint as the
first HDR image. The "luximage.pic" file contains the
information needed for contour lines showing lux levels.

If you don't have this information you can't create
contour plots of lux level!

However, you still can create contour plots from the
original images. These lines will have "Nits" as unit
and show the "brightness" of an element in the scene
instead of the illuminace on that element (i.e. the
quantity of light reflected from a table vs. the light
falling on that table). The command for this is

$ falsecolor -cl -s 1000 -i rendering.pic -p rendering.pic > cline.pic

As you see input data ("-i" option) and background image
("-p" option) are the same file here. I think you can omit
the "-p" option in this case, but I can't check it now.
You may have to change the value of the "-s" ("scale")
option so it contains all the levels of your image. See
the man page of falsecolor for details and further useful
options.

Regards,
Thomas

Hi everybody...again

Im a regular nuisance on here, please dont kick me off Greg!

In addition to my last email, i have a query regarding light measurement within radiance. When viewing an .oct in rvu if i type t and then click on a point, it will give me a few values, the last of which, i assume, is luminance in nits.

Firstly is this assumption correct?

Is there a way to measure illuminance as opposed to luminance?

Thanks in advance

Chris

Hi Chris,

If anyone should be kicked off, it's me -- I've been answering e- 
mails when I'm rushed and tired and doing a bad job of it, so  
apologies to everyone.

You are correct that the last value reported (the one with an 'L'  
next to it) in rvu is the luminance in candelas/meter^2, or nits.  To  
get illuminance instead, turn on the -i option via the "set i y"  
command in rvu then do the trace again.  You can switch irradiance  
mode off again with "set i n".

I hope this helps!
-Greg

Chris.
 
You can find an online version of the rvu man page here:
 
http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/man_html/rvu.1.html
 
From the description of "trace" I guess your assumption is
correct, for certain values of correct. The man page says the
"value" will be printed as well but I remember vaguely that
it was split in its red, green and blue component. I can't
simply switch to my Radiance machine right now to test it
so you have to figure it out yourself.
 
For illuminace simply use the "-i" option when you start
rvu. Again I am not sure rvu supports this but I don't see
a reason why it shouldn't.

Message-ID: <cdf76d820607281256p6e738d61s2d8c5be1c0b75c8@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I have a question that is not very specific to radiance usage but felt that
most of the online forum users might have a good idea about it:

Though light shelves are widely perceived to bounce daylight into interiors
off of the ceiling and also cut down glare, they are more effective in
cutting down the glare and do not actually increase the daylight levels at
the back of the room.

True or false? Why?

Thanks in advance,

Both. Because light is a wave (and complicated).

I've not done a proper study on the effectiveness of light
shelves but my general understanding is as follows:

1) Light shelves are useful when there is some sunlight to
    redirect into the room. In this case they should increase
    the daylight factor further into the room. If the room
    is too long even a light shelve will not help. The room
    geometry (and of course surface colours) have to fit to
    benefit of a light shelve treatment.

2) Because they are effectively an obstruction in the window
    they will reduce the DF for the front and the middle of
    the room. At the front we usually have plenty of daylight
    and don't mind; in the middle the loss in DF might in fact
    be bigger than the gain at the back which would reduce the
    overall DF.

3) Daylight studies (at least DF calculations) are usually done
    with a standard CIE overcast sky. This sky model has no sunlight
    component and is therefore most inappropriate to estimate the
    efficiency of light shelves. A light shelve will only reduce the
    available window opening and the light coming in.
    However it's the only sky model mentioned in the British Standard
    - and I suppose everywhere else - so it's used to get the one or
    two numbers the architects need to get their BREEAM or LEED browny
    points. [1]


Thomas


[1] I'm open for any suggestion to improve this sad status of
     daylight design in the current practitioners work - but please
     start a new thread.

Hi Ramana,

I think it will be imprecise to answer your question in terms of black or
white. In fact it depends on several factor such lightshelf type, geometry,
size, location, materials, window orientation and size, room dimensions, sky
conditions ("luminous climate"), building maintenance among others.

Sometimes, controlling the amount of radiation entering a room and therefore
reducing very high light levels close to the window wall helps creating a
comfortable lighting environment, by reducing the contrast between levels at
the view window and those at the back of the room, yet sacrificing on
illuminance levels.

Hello all,

I have a question that is not very specific to radiance usage but felt that
most of the online forum users might have a good idea about it:

Though light shelves are widely perceived to bounce daylight into interiors
off of the ceiling and also cut down glare, they are more effective in
cutting down the glare and do not actually increase the daylight levels at
the back of the room.

True or false? Why?

Thanks in advance,

Dear Group

I am attempting to use illums in conjunction with translucent light fixtures 
in order to produce smoother renderings. One problem that I am having is 
that the illums themselves are causing shadows (see here)

For the wall fixture, you can see the shadow of the spherical illum. I am 
using a void material for the illum so it's invisible to the eye but 
obviously not invisible to shadow rays. Is there any work around for this?


Thanks


Marcus

Hi Marcus,

I attempt to explain why illum's cast shadows on page 573 of  
"Rendering with Radiance" (Figure 13.5).  The best workaround in your  
case is to use a combination of direct subsampling (-ds) and direct  
jitter (-dj) to make the shadows less noticeable.  In fact, they  
should be there, but they shouldn't be so sharp.  Turning on  
PENUMBRAS in rad will accomplish the same thing.

Hi Ramana,

Light shelves do redirect light deeper into a space under both overcast 
and clear sky conditions. Whether they do this effectively and for all 
overcast and clear sky conditions depends on building and light shelf 
design. They do not necessarily block nor reduce glare. That depends on 
design particulars as well.

Subject: [Radiance-general] calculation weirdness
Message-ID: <44CE362102000049000004F1@wmtao.com>

Hi all, I'm running a radiance calculation, and as always, I compare my radiance calcs with AGI to make sure I didn't mess up.  I know enough to be dangerous!  :)
 
My comparison consists of placing a calculation point 10' below an iesfile based light fixture.
 
AGI calc = 64810 lux
 
Radiance = 40,822 lux.
 
ies2rad -di -t white iesfile.rad
rtrace -w -h -I -ab 0 -aa .1 -ad 2048 -as 512 -ar 512 -ds .1 -aw 0 test.oct < input_pt.txt | rcalc -e '$1=47.4*$1+120*$2+11.6*$3'
 
OK, red flag, I've messed up somehow.  The numbers are off by 30%.
 
After almost giving up, I ran the same command but deleted the "-ds .1" and got 64844 lux!
 
What's going on here?  I would think source substructuring "-ds .1" would be better than the default (which I think is .2)  I appreciate your thoughts.
 
Mark
