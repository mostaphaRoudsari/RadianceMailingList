Dear Group

I am modeling a bathroom that will use translucent light fixtures similar to 
this:

http://www.homedepot.com/cmc_upload/HDUS/EN_US/asset/images/eplus/725916808877_3.jpg

I wish to accurately simulate the light distribution from the fixtures 
however I do not know where to begin as far as determining physically valid 
parameters for the trans material. Does anyone here know where I may obtain 
data for such light fixtures and how to correctly translate this data into 
Radiance?

I have some additional questions concerning the trans material type. In a 
Radiance reference manual, it is stated:

"Trans is a translucent material, similar to plastic. The transmissivity is 
the fraction of penetrating
light that travels all the way through the material. The transmitted 
specular component is the fraction of transmitted light that is not 
diffusely scattered. Transmitted and diffusely reflected light is modified 
by the material color. Translucent objects are infinitely thin."


First, should the transmissivity + transmitted specular component = 1 in 
order for the material to be physically correct? Also, since the transmitted 
specular component is the fraction of transmitted light that is not 
diffusely scattered, does this mean that this is apart of the direct 
calculation or is this too apart of the indirect calculation.


Thanks

Marcus

Hi Marcus,

Welcome to the wonderful, confusing world of "trans".

I don't know of any good way to measure oddly-shaped translucent  
materials.  Perhaps others on the list will have suggestions for  
that....

The reason the trans parameters are so peculiar is so their valid  
range is easy to understand -- between 0 and 1 for everything except  
roughness.  (For physical value ranges, you may also consult the file  
"ray/doc/notes/materials".)  Pages 325 and 326 from Chas' chapter in  
"Rendering with Radiance" are also invaluable.  There have been a  
number of threads on trans over the years, and this is definitely one  
for the Radiance FAQ, should it ever materialize -- no pun intended.

Hi Marcus,

Unfortunately this is one of those areas where the best course of action 
is some measurement, followed with some trial and error.  Trans can 
effectively model this material, however.  I did a bunch of measurements 
of a translucent glazing several years ago, to obtain the transmittance 
at the normal as well as every 15-degrees off-axis. A trans material was 
then created and progressively modified until the curves for the trans 
and the measurements aligned pretty well.  This will be fairly easy, 
assuming you can get a flat glass sample of those tulip-shaped shades. 
(Full disclosure: Greg helped me fit the data to a valid trans 
description, which is a large part of why it was fairly easy.)  
Measuring the actual shade itself would be a real bear, I'd expect.

The best references for trans are the flowchart at Schorsch's site, 
(http://www.schorsch.com/rayfront/manual/transdef.html) and pp 325-326 
in RwR. 

Good luck; I know Visarc Jack did some courthouse renderings a long time 
ago that featured these large alabaster pendant bowl-like shades, and 
they looked amazing; the trans really captured the soft lamp image quite 
well.  Maybe Jack can share what he did?  Even if he measured the actual 
shade, they had a fairly large radius to them.  Your tulip shades will 
be a real challenge, I think.

Hey Guys,

Thanks for the insight. First, concerning my oddly shaped lighting fixtures, 
the ones that I have modeled actually look like this:

http://i35.photobucket.com/albums/d178/marcdevon/bathroomview.jpg

So I think they are actually more complicated that the example that I showed 
to you before. Out of curiosity, just as many modeling software estimate a 
complex surface as a mesh of planes or triangles, could the same principle 
be used for the lighting fixtures themselves. In other words, instead of 
seeing each fixture as a single complex surface, can it be considered it as 
just a group of flat planes? One item that I need to have addressed is 
whether I should model the diffuse shades a single surface or if it 
acceptable to have inner and outer surfaces (you can think of it as having a 
thickness to it). See here:

http://i35.photobucket.com/albums/d178/marcdevon/luminaireview.jpg


The information in Rayfront's user manual and pages 325-326 from RwR were 
VERY useful to me in gaining insight as to how Radiance treats light. There 
was a word that was mentioned that has me worried. Measure. Aside from not 
having any experience with performing a empirical test of light 
distribution, measuring light sounds very expensive. May I ask, would 
purchasing the needed equipment require a second mortgage to be taken out or 
giving up one's first born? Is it required to use transfunc or transdata in 
lieu of trans to obtain acceptable accuracy?


Thanks,

Marcus

Hi Marcus,

Without actual photometric data (such as an ies file) to apply to  
your group of flat planes, you have to model the actual comple  
geometry.  But I'm afraid I may have misunderstood your question.  As  
for the single/dual surface question, I guess it depends on how close  
your views will bring you to the shade.  The trans material is  
infinitely thin, and it'd be best to model the thng as a single  
surface.  For closeup work, you may need to introduce thickness but  
that's gonna get a lot more complicated from a valid material  
definition standpoint.

Mmmm, measurements, yeah.  The gear can be expensive.  Let's see, at  
my old job, where I did these measurements, I used an illuminance  
meter, a luminance meter and a theatrical spotlight (ETC Source Four  
HID, aka "leko", or ERS).  The light fixture was a free sample, but  
you could use other sources too.  The illuminance meter (Minolta  
Somethingorother-nowdiscontinued) was about $800 and the luminance  
meter (Minolta LS-100) was more expensive, I believe almost three  
thousand USD.  Actually, here are a couple of links I just found for  
the meters I used (the illuminance meter I link to here is a newer  
model than I used, but it's basically the same thing).

http://www.tequipment.net/MinoltaTL1.asp
http://www.tequipment.net/MinoltaLS100.asp

It's expensive not to mention time-consuming, but it's also fun and  
is an excellent example of the power of Radiance, in that Radiance is  
happy to accept material data as complex as you are willing to gather.

Maybe Peter can chime in with his thoughts on this stuff, and maybe  
an update on his goniophotometer project?

Just to add to what Rob said. I know that it is possible to arrange for 
equipment rentals directly from KonicaMinolta. This especially makes 
sense for the luminance meter which is indeed ~$3,000 at retail. Also on 
the spot light that Rob mentioned, good camera equipment stores that are 
set up to provide rental equipment to professionals will have a wide 
selection of lighting. I know that for one exercise I rented a small 
spotlight where you could adjust the beam spread (sorry I do not 
remember the name/type) at a reasonable price.

Thanks

Although I would like to avoid the time and expense of performing this 
analytical work, I am thinking that it may be necessary. First, is there any 
existing data that is readily available for translucent materials that are 
used as diffusing elements for light fixtures? Also, are there any 
specifications or procedures as to how to perform these tests?

Thanks

Dear Ignacio,

Thanks so much for nrv!
Its great to see an effort made getting radiance on win32 up to speed!
Nrv is great since it allows me to see octree's generated with obj2mesh.
Which is a lifesaver!

Thanks so much for your efforts!

Kindly,

Hello all, 

Could someone spare me five minutes please and answer a question i have? I have an IGES (.igs) file of a model of a car and i want to use it in radiance if possible. Does anyone know if i can and how i can do this? 

Thanks 

Chris

p.s. World Cup starts tonight!! I bet an England-Germany final.

Hi Chris, 

Try to get your hands on a modeller such as Rhino, which supports .iges very
well. Than mesh the nurbs surfaces in your app and export as .obj
If this is one-time-only you could consider downloading the rhino 30 day
eval. Version

Cheers,

BRLCAD (which is a free csg-based CAD) supports both IGES and OBJ. So 
you could try to convert from IGES to G (the model format in BRLCAD) and 
from G to OBJ. As BRLCAD is a unix application, just like radiance, it 
should be possible to easily integrate this into your radiance workflow 
by piping through the conversion chain (import and export filters are 
standalone command line tools).

Cool... I will just try that out myself tonight ;-)))

Can someone point me to a cal file, or a method to make a metal roof?

Something with a profile like this ASCII art

Even a brightdata (without the ridge geometry) that would indicate the
ridges.
I thought there was one in the sample Radiance files (cabin, etc) but I
can't find it.

Thanks

The designer is using Sketchup and I'm rendering with - of course -
Radiance. Composite done in photosop.  Radiance view did not match pic, so I
did a little skewing in PS.

Thanks for all the input on art lighting - I'll post  pics as it comes

That sounds interesting, as I actually do not have experienced such a room.
Were the panels used on all sides or to one direction only? My idea was to
have a big diffuse-translucent wall (only) to north. Also Ithink that for an
exhibition pavillion, especially for architectural models, a diffuse
environment is a terrific idea. All those I know use spots to take fotos of
their models and to show them (of course with a diffuse environment around).

But I really wonder on the impact of these panels on color, did you
experience any noticable effect? It would also interesting to know what
happens after some years, at least with those based on plastics (I would not
worry about the glass-based products, but I am also not sure here).
Christopher has done validation work on such panels, maybe he has more to
say about it.

Hi Rob,

One thing to try would be to use the corrug.cal which simulates 
corrugations. I know this is not exactly the same but it would give you 
the linear effect of such a roofing material. One could probably modify 
this with a step function to great a sharp cutoff versus what the smooth 
funtion in corrug.cal. Perhaps another option would be to engineer a 
simple repetitive cal with with perhaps three different value (color at 
top of metal rib, color at bottom and shadow). Yet another alternative 
could be to make an image map in Gimp (or photoshop) that can be tiled 
to create the effect you want.

Hi Ali,

I will try to give you a few hints on this topic. To get geometry into 
Radiance one needs to export the geometry from their modeling 
application of choice into a format that can be readily converted to 
Radiance's format. From Autocad, one solution is to use radout which can 
be found on Georg Mischler's site:

    http://www.schorsch.com/download/radout/

Note though that this will only work up through Autocad 2000 as far as I 
know. However one of the nice things about this application is that it 
exports directly to Radiances file format.

Now if your mesh needs to have "mesh" type properties such as local U,V 
coordinates you will need to use an intermediate application such as 
Rhino or PolyTrans which can read in Autocad .dwg format files and 
export to .obj. This can then be converted with Radiance's obj2rad or 
obj2mesh command.

Now I am not clear on what you mean about the files being 
"automatically" updated. Material assignment is done based on the 
geometry groupings (such as by layer name or layer color are the two 
conventions available from radout). You will need to create a material 
file that defines materials for each element of geometry that has been 
exported.

Note, if you are going to use Radiance as part of your Thesis work, I 
would strongly urge you to get a copy of "Rendering with Radiance" which 
is loaded with a great deal of very useful information.

Regards,

-Jack de Valpine

These two commands will help you in the task.
3ds3mgf
mgf2rad
Optionally you may use
torad or dxf2rad.

I use obj (obj2rad and obj2mesh) as an exchange file format but I do not
think that autocad has this option. You may investigate blender and brad
or an alternative commercial solution (maya, cinema, max, rhino...).

Additionally there is a script that eliminates the material descriptions
from 3ds converted files and allows you to use a custom file for them
(this would facilitate updating the model if using 3ds). Look for it on
this email list, it's somewhere.

Anyway the strategy is almost the same with all of them: you create a 3d
file within your favourite software, save as an exchange format, run the
conversion command, compile the scene and generate the results.
Every time you change the model in a 3d software you need to import it
again (this can be automated with a script).

hope this is useful.
ciao
G.

Hi Ali,

As I understand it, the active development for Desktop Radiance ceased 
some time ago. It uses an older version of the Radiance simulation 
engine than what is currently available in the standard Radiance 
distribution. If you want something with a front end gui you might take 
a look at Rayfront (www.schorsch.com) otherwise there are compiles of 
Radiance binaries  for cygwin (www.cygwin.com) which runs under windows. 
The current version of Radiance has quite a few powerful new features 
and enhancements that the older version does not.

Hope this helps,

-Jack

Hi all,

I am new to this enviornemnt.

I have been doing day lighting analysis using IES which has radiance built
in to it, but the modeling agent that IES caries is very poor. I have
created the geometry in CATIA and would like to use radiance to analyze it.

I guess my first question is where can I find radiance?
Does it work on windows? If so what version? (currently running windows xp)

Thanks
Charlie.

&file=index&req=viewdownload&cid=4>

AFAIK they don't include any user interfaces (rvu, ximage). But you can
use them
for rendering and convert the images to a Windows friendly format.
 
Rayfront (see www.schorsch.com) offers a complete interface on Windows
but uses an older version of Radiance (not that it'd make a big
difference in
everyday use).

are binaries i can highly recommend. the dtp radiance binaries are
_seriously_ outdated. I've been using these binaries for some time now, and
am quite happy with these.
nrv is a very cool tool, its a good rview replacement that works fine with
the new binaries and support the MESH primitive.

thanks a lot for that effort Ignacio!

Ali,

To add to what Jack mentioned, if you wish to use the Desktop Radiance 
AutoCad front end and still use a more recent version of Radiance, you can 
try replacing the Desktop Radiance binaries (usually located in 
c:\Radiance\bin) with the Windows binaries compiled by Francesco Anselmo  
(select "Mingw Radiance Binaries"):

http://www.bozzograo.net/radiance/modules.php?op=modload&name=Downloads&file=index&req=viewdownload&cid=4

I think that these binaries are compiled from either Radiance version 3.6 or 
3.7. You can not run the cygwin binaries directly from the Desktop Radiance 
front end. You will have to export the geometry from DR and run the binaries 
from cygwin's BASH shell. However, if you use the Windows binaries compiled 
by Francesco, you should be able to run these binaries (e.g. rad, oconv, 
rpict, rtrace, etc) directly from DR. However, it should be noted that you 
will not be able to use DR's winrview with octrees that are built with the 
Francesco's Windows binaries.

Hi Thomas,

Actually, the release notes for the last few releases are sprinkled with 
all kinds of improvements and bug fixes that make the newer binaries 
really desirable in my book.  So much so, that even though we use 
Rayfront here at my job, we pretty much only use it for geometry import 
and material application -- essentially, for scene generation.  After 
that, we use the latest binaries on Linux to actually create octrees and 
images*. 

A couple of things that I now take for granted with the newer binaries 
is the ability of oconv to generate octrees out of very complex geometry 
with far less "set overflow in addobject" errors, and the fixed rpict 
bug that caused half the image to be garbled in certain scenes with many 
light sources.  There were some fairly serious bugs fixed along the way 
too.  If there's any way that people can run the latest Radiance on 
Linux or OS X, (IOW, any 'real' operating system), I highly recommend 
they do so.  That said, I think it's great all the efforts made by 
Francesco and Schorsch and others in getting _something_ running on 
Windows.  I just believe that the latest-greatest-Radiance is worth the 
hassle of Linux (or the expense of OS X). 

*On an unrelated note, I think "octrees and images" is a good name for a 
band.  =8-)

There are reasonable solutions to that, as mentioned before, NRV is really
cool as an up-to-date rview/rvu replacement:
http://www.aisarquitectura.com/nrv/

Also HDRshop is a terrific .pic viewer, its very, very fast:
http://www.hdrshop.com/

Radiance is a unix tool, we all know that, but really, stop this windows
bashing, its not very constructive at all. A lot of new users will be on
win32, its part of life as we know it, so please, let's deal with it that
way. There are respectable reasons for working on win32, there's simply no
way of denying that. Autocad, Archicad, Rhino, Solidworks, Catia, Pro/E,
TracePro aren't software that work on linux, and work fine with Radiance. So
please, let's be a little more mature and stop discussing platform as soon
as the win32 question comes up...

imho, Radiance on wintel isn't _nearly_ as crippled as suggested... 
And honestly, I'm really irritated of this win32 bashing. First of all, its
simply _not_ true. Radiance runs smooth on win32, and fast as well.
If you need to address more than 2GB of memory you really shouldn't be on
win32, otherwise its just fine.

I've used it extensively on both linux and win32 and since most CAD packages
run on win32, it's a very important platform for Radiance to run on. Big up
to Francesco for making the new binaries happen, his binaries are _such_ a
major update in comparison to dtp-rad.

Can we all please get to agree to __stop__ redirecting win32 newbies to
ancient, seriously outdated binaries, part of a project that did not reach a
mature level at all? Seriously dtp-rad does is not representative of the
status of where Radiance is and a dead project is __not__ at all
representative of the vivid Radiance community we are. 

Dtp-Rad is DEAD, long live Francesco's binaries!
Oh, while I'm at it, I think dtp-rad is a monstrosity, and am happy to see
it gone. Using Radiance isn't easy and perhaps shouldn't even have to be
easy. It's a tool for experts, right! So there's no point in suggesting no
expertise is required to use these tools, the truth is quite the contrary.

Oh, and to throw oil on these flames, please, I understand unix-evangelism
and all, but really; Radiance SUCKS on cygwin, I'm sorry, but I consider
this as quite an objective fact. A part from dtp-rad, cygwin is the worst
user-experience of Radiance one can obtain IMHO. Also bash isn't a nessecity
for running Radiance at all. Personally I much prefer python for doing so.
There are many ways of interfacing with Radiance, and unix-shells are just
one way of doing so.

A lot of potential Radiance users are on win32, so let's get some kind of
coherent advice on how to use Radiance on this platform rather than reaching
out trying to have these users chance platform. 

If you don't have any real experience in working with Radiance on windows,
please stop giving this really bad advice and let's try to settle on more
intelligent advice.

Without debating the merits or drawbacks of Windows vs. Unix, let me  
just speculate that a reasonable Windows environment (e.g., VirtualPC  
or similar) will probably be available for Intel-based Apple hardware  
soon, allowing one to run most Windows applications at native speed  
and sending files directly to Radiance running under OS X.  Since a  
decent dual-core Mac mini can be had for less than $800 US, a  
fraction of the cost of most of the CAD systems we're discussing,  
this may be a reasonable solution for some, and Radiance runs quite  
fast on that platform.  The current "Boot Camp" approach requires  
radical switching between systems, which is no fun in my opinion.   
This situation is bound to improve since the hardware is capable --  
probably before the year is out.

Has anyone tried "Wine Doors" or found a convenient way to run  
Windows under a running Linux system, allowing files to be passed  
between?  This might also be a reasonable solution for those needing  
the latest bits of Radiance.

Native Windows binaries of Radiance are great, and it's wonderful  
that Francesco has provided these to the community for free, and  
kudos as well to Ignacio for nrv!  From my limited experience with  
Cygwin, I tend to agree with Jelle that this approach leaves much to  
be desired.  It's much better to do away with the middleman,  
especially when it keeps munging process memory.

Multiprocessing and advanced Radiance features are going to be  
lacking or lagging on Windows for the indefinite future, since most  
development happens under Unix, and that's just the way it is.  Even  
so, being a year behind is better than being 8 years behind and  
growing, which is where Desktop Radiance is regrettably stuck.

important to give new users a few decent hints, rather than referring to a

Just a hint for those in desperate need of the apps mentioned above. The 
programs that don't come with a Unix release (are you sure about Pro/E 
and Catia?) often have Mac-OS-versions. And that gives you a more or 
less comfortable unix environment without the need to emulate a unix 
environment. The difference between Linux, Solaris and Mac OS on the 
command line for Radiance users are neglectible.

Hi Greg and Jelle,

I don't think any of this discussion was meant to start a flame fest 
pro/con windows/linux/unix.

One solution that we are testing right now is using VMWare to run linux 
virtual machines under windows xp. With this setup we can run our 
preferred modeling application, Autocad, under windows and Radiance 
under linux all on the same physical piece of hardware. Note though that 
the Radiance work on this setup is really for setup and prepping of 
materials, views and scenes. We still run simulations on more powerful 
production servers.

VMWare can also be used to do the opposite to run a Windows XP virtual 
machine under linux. In essence this enable two "machines" (or more) to 
run on the same piece of hardware. File sharing can be dealt with in a 
number of ways ranging from a simple mechanism built into VMWare to 
running a Samba server on the linux side.

Obviously there are some minimal costs involved with using VMWare. To 
build/set-up virtual machines you need to get a license for VMWare 
Workstation which is under $200. However you really only need one in 
order to build virtual machines that can be deployed onto other 
hardware. Once a virtual machine is created it can be used on other 
workstations with VMWare's free VMWare Player tool for running virtual 
machines. Note that VMWare's product offerings are pretty broad and for 
this reason somewhat confusing, for example I recently learned that they 
have another free product called VMWare Server that sound's like it can 
also be used to create virtual machines so this might be worth looking 
into.

Another virtualization product to keep an eye on will be XenSource. 
Although they have demo'd with windows based vms, I think their 
virtualization solutions currently only work for varying flavors of 
unix/linux.

OK, now to potentially add fuel to the flame fest fire.... Our in-house 
workflow is based on a production process where the 3d modeling 
application(s) are decoupled from the rendering application, eg they are 
not an integrated solution. I prefer to think that they are best in 
breed solutions. And there are a whole host of reasons that make 
decoupling rendering from modeling very important and useful. Modeling 
occurs in one set of preferred applications while rendering/simulation 
occurs in another, Radiance. The different applications have different 
user interfaces. Because of this, different os's are needed to run the 
preferred applications, it is just a simple fact of life.

On another note, I know that there are opensource solutions such as Wine 
which it sound like Wine Doors is a spin off of. I think that Wine can 
successfully used to run some windows applications but the question is 
whether you can run something like Autocad or any other robust 3D 
modeling/CAD production tool. However, I suspect that the installation 
could be a real bear. In these days of Windows Update/WGA, etc., it 
seems to me better/simpler to use a commercial product.

Best,

-Jack de Valpine

After all these great contributions, I want to add some thoughts about 
the criterias. First, I also have a mingw-compile installed on the 
Autocad-Dektop I am sitting right now. Performance is not critical here, 
  but it is nice to be able to check a scene or do a quick preview here. 
But if people start to wonder about performance, virtual machines to get 
the latest out of their radiance-windows set up etc, I think it is easy 
to waste time. IMHO, in any serious production environment, it seams to 
be the best to set up a rendering machine and spend all the time and 
efforts on the integration of this machine instead of any workarounds to 
run it in parallel with a windows installation.

1) Your rendering machine has completely different needs. No display 
needed, no graphic cards, no keyboard, no mouse. Instead pure processing 
power (which may lead to high noise and your machine away from your 
desktop). If you set up some queuing and power management, you can have 
it up and running 24/7 and just send render jobs from all desktops. If 
you leave your office, either switch off your desktop or put in an 
openmosix-cd so it can add some computing power to your linux system.


2) Radiance on Linux is very easy to remote-control. In fact, I do all 
my renderings on a machine 2000 km away over a ssh connection (yes, 56K 
modem speed, but ssh allows compression), all my data is in a cvs. 
Control by ssh (with X-forwarding). Choose between the many ways to 
transfer data (either by a mounted volume from a file server which is 
accessed by both desktop and render machine, or by any other transport. 
Ask Schorsch about Rayfronts additional capabilities to remote control jobs.

3) One of the most important point for rendering is stability. I would 
not want to have people start and quit all kinds of apps, log in and 
off, print etc on a windows desktop while I have a rendering runnings 
since four days on the same machine. A dedicated machine allows you to 
have only few, well-tested software in a stable environment.

If you need a REAL integration (without performance drawbacks) use a 
unix-system. I mentioned that Mac OS is a unix-like with most CAD apps 
available. So that is the cute, slim laptop set-up, with cad, radiance 
(the very latest without any workarounds) natively running and at full 
speed. Or take a look at the modelers available for unixes, like Maya, 
Houdini, ... It is not impossible to do 3d on unix.

Really, I see the Radiance/Windows as a nice alternative for people who 
want to do "preflight-checks" on their modeling desktops or do some 
small / fast simulations. In fact, most light studies do not require too 
much calculation and even few of the brand-new features of the latest 
radiance cvs. For those, vmware and other virtualization solutions are 
ok, and the mingw-binaries with the new preview for windows will be 
great. But if processing speed is needed, as in a production workflow, I 
really think that setting up a unix-machine is worth it!

Amen.  Allow me to respond to Jelle's original post, as from what I can 
tell, the references to winbashing are directed at me.  I may have said 
something to the effect that Windows isn't a "real" os.  Maybe that was 
a cheap shot, but let's look at the facts.  Unix flavors boast many 
tools to facilitate working with Radiance, such as multiprocessing 
support, robust shells that are scriptable (yes, cross platform 
scripting tools like Python, Perl, et al. have negated this one a bit, 
but then again Jelle's point is about Radiance access to the masses and 
the masses aren't necessarily gonna be Python wizards) and of course 
full support of the toolbox model _which is exactly the paradigm that 
Radiance was constructed to work in_. 

I struggled with Linux for a long time to get a usable system and get 
Radiance compiled, way back in the day.  Sure, most people aren't as 
stubborn as I am and perhaps we're losing new users to the dread of 
having to become a Unix sysadmin just to use a "program" like Radiance.  
But let me tell you something else: you know who told me to stick to my 
guns and learn Radiance from the unix shell?  It was none other than 
Schorsch himself, about eight years ago!  Now eight years is a long 
time, and since then the windows binaries have, well, they've appeared 
in the first place, and only improved since then.  But there are still 
bugs and missing tools.  I agree with Jack that there's a disconnect 
between the rendering and modleing processes, and as he and others have 
said in this thread, the best tool for the job is what you want to be 
using.  There is no doubt that it can be a gigantic PITA to have to buy, 
maintain and bounce between systems to accomplish the tasks at hand.  
But many of us have devised a workflow that allows a relatively smooth 
transition from the modeling side -- usually done on Windows systems -- 
to the rendering/calculation side, usually done on an OS X Mac or a 
Linux box and found the benefits to be worth the efforts.

Ignacio's nrv is indeed a very exciting new addition to the Windows 
radiance practicioner's toolkit. Francesco's mingw binaries and 
Schorsch's binaries that ship with Rayfront are great ways to try 
radiance on Windows.  I absolutely agree that Cygwin is awful and DTR & 
I did not get along well either.  I wouldn't wish those on anyone.  But 
I still feel like the best way to get involved with Radiance for the 
typical Windows user is to get your hands on a spare machine that you 
can install Linux on. Many users have chimed in on this thread with 
good, constructive ways of using two machines to get the job done.  If a 
decent cad program -- let me rephrase that: a cad program that was 
accurate and that this AutoCAD user could figure out in minimal time -- 
would ever come out for OS X, I'd say a Mac OS X computer is all you 
need.  I've been waiting for that for four and a half years now, 
though.  the new BootCamp and Parallels options available to Intel Mac 
users are promising, in that they offer the ability to use one hardware 
platform to host all your best of breed apps, in the OS they require. 
But as Greg said BootCamp requires back and forth rebooting to change 
OSes, which, stinks.  I beta tested Parallels, which can run unix and 
Windows in parallel.  It was pretty fast at first, but strangely enough 
got slower and more buggy with each interim release.  The final release 
is now available and I'm still debating whether to give it one more 
chance.  But I digress.

Clearly, the current state of the Windows tools allow users to exploit a 
good deal of the Radiance toolkit today, on Windows, should they wish to 
do so.  But I maintain that it's still not perfect, and still has its 
own litany of downloads and workarounds needed to install it and use 
it.  I mean, you don't just double-click setup.exe and start rendering.  
So my feeling is that if it's a struggle either way, why not try to use 
Radiance in the environment it was conceived in?  AFAIK, I never told 
anyone to use Cygwin or DTR.  I'll bite my tongue re: Windows in general 
from now on.  I'll try.  But I will also stand by my assertion that Unix 
is still the best platform on which to run Radiance.  I don't think 
anyone here gave out INcoherent information regarding anything.  
Opinions differ, that's all.

Maybe a coherent Win/Radiance HOWTO can be part of the 
radiance-online.org knowledgebase as that moves forward.  I ain't gonna 
write it, but I agree with you Jelle, there probably needs to be one.

Hi Giulio,

Yes, I tried it out in beta.  Not terribly impressive at first, as you 
couldn't share files between the virtualized Windows drive and the Mac.  
Then subsequent releases got slower and slower.  Got a  few kernel 
panics along the way too.  They have added a tool to allow sharing 
between filesystems, but I never got a chance to try it out during the 
beta.  That said, it was very cool running AutoCAD 2000 on my MAC!  It 
ran fairly fast at first, but as I said it got slower and slower, but 
you have to take speed with a grain of salt with beta software anyway.  
They just released version 1.0, and I am considering buying it.

I should mention, however, that my MacBook Pro experience has not been 
great lately.  There is a whine, or a screech emanating from the cpu.  
This existed from day one, and it's well documented on the forums.  I 
waited until day 89 of my 90 day free support in hopes that a 
downloadable solution to this would crop up, but it never happened.  So 
I sent my computer to Apple to fix it, I explained the issue to the 
letter, and I got it back yesterday.  Guess what?  It's still busted.  
So now I get to battle with Customer Relations to see about an unlikely 
refund.  I'd rather return it than keep sending it back and forth 
culminating in some statement like "that's normal, that noise".  We'll 
see.  Overall, the Intel Macs are really nice (and FAST (and HOT)).  
I've just got some version 1.0 gremlins in mine, which is a real drag.

I never tried BootCamp, because I don't have a license for windowsXP, 
which is the minimum OS that it supposedly supports.  Parallels allows 
you to install Windows 2000 (which I do have), as well as tons of other 
OSes.  It's pretty cool.

I will be taking delivery on a Mac Book Pro 15", 2.16 GHz Core Duo in  
a couple of weeks and will try Parallels on it with Windows XP SP2.   
i will use it initially for GPS/topo mapping apps (DeLorme topo  
synced to my handheld Garmin GPS) so we'll see what that can do.  If  
anyone wants me to try a windows app on it, let me know.  Oh, I'll  
also be trying Minesweeper as well.  ;-)

Subject: [Radiance-general] Thanks for support ...
Message-ID: <44971620.8070602@gmx.de>

Hi there,

thanks to everyone for helping me with my radiance problems in my 
thesis, especially Greg for his help on explaining the integration of a 
better RGB rendering, mentioned in the 'Picture Perfect' essay. I never 
expected this list to be that helpful and supportive as it is,  this is 
really a living 'handbook'!  I gave the thesis  in last wednesday and 
hope it will turn out all right.
Seven months ago i didn't know anything about radiance only that Relux 
Vision uses a version of it. I am a windows user and found the cygwin 
implementation of radiance. I used this one because it was the only one 
i could find on the net. I was happy to be able to use all the Unix 
commands out of the 'Rendering with Radiance Book'. Cygwin is not really 
a practical system but it was enough for my needs and i didn't wanted to 
swap systems in the middle of my thesis. Now i want to move on and use a 
more practical and stable version of radiance. After following your 
discussion about radiance on different systems can you tell me, what is 
the better alternative: using the windows based version 'mingw' ( of 
which i heard for the first time) or ( as i planned ) use the Knoppix 
Version of Linux from the Learnix platform. Up to now i don't plan to 
install a Unix system.
Thanks for advice,

Christian

Hi, I'm trying to investigate the effectiveness of a lightshelf using a
Radiance model.  I'm finding that either the lightshelf is totally
ineffective or there's a problem with my model or my use of Radiance.  Has
anyone done anything similar and is willing to give me some advice?

Thanks,

Nick

Nick,

Need a little bit more information: is the shelf specular and are you  
modelling skies with sun?  If yes to both, are you modelling the  
shelf as material "mirror" and have you set the parameters for the  
"virtual light source" calculation accordingly?  See section 11.3 of  
the Radiance book and have a look at the "virtual" office example in  
the "obj" directory of the Radiance release.

I used a semi-specular 90% reflective plastic material for the shelf under
both cloudy and intermediate sunny skies.  I guess this explains why no
direct sunlight was being reflected.  I'll read up on the virtual light
source calculation and try using a mirror material later.  I'm still not
sure why I saw virtually no improvement in daylight distribution, even
without the direct reflection shouldn't there be some bouncing of diffuse
light deeper into the space.  I used quite a high ceiling reflectance and I
think I used sufficient ambient parameters, number of bounces etc.  

The test room was based on the one in chapter 6, with a 500mm clerestory
window, 500mm internal projection and 750mm external projection.  I used
skies for spring, summer and winter at midday, latitude 51 degrees north: a
CIE cloudy sky, and four intermediate sunny skies rotated to give N S E W
orientations.

Hello,

Does anyone know how to use BRL-CAD? I have a simple .igs file and am tryin to convert it into a .g (BRLCAD format) and from that into a .obj format so that i can use it in radiance. (i cannot do a straight .igs to .obj transformation with BRLCAD).

Im following the manuel that came with BRLCAD and Lars has helped me alot, however im still stuck (and simple!)

I have my iges-g, g-obj and .igs file in the same directory (brlcad), but when i type (in a shell window)

'iges-g -o picture.o picture.igs'  <------------taken from manuel previously mentioned

It tells me this

displays@cropston brlcad]$ ./iges-g -o 42211A.g 42211A.igs
./iges-g: error while loading shared libraries: librt.so.19: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

ive located this librt.so.19 file and moved it to the same directory to see if that was the problem but it isnt. i cant open this librt file with kwrite either.

points of note. 
im using a linux system.
im useless on computers
i downloaded the brlcad-7.8.0_linux_ia32.tar.bz2 version of BRLCAD from sourceforge.net, a link from brlcad.org

can anyone help??

thanks in advance

chris

Chris,

Did you build the software? It sounds like the build process 
didn't know where the librt.so.19 file was during the linking 
procedure. One way to correct this is to make sure that there is 
a "-L/usr/X11R6/lib/" -type entry on the linker command line "ld" 
or the compile command line (if the compile command is 
responsible for linking, too, as it sometimes is.)

Unfortunately, just moving the library to the right place doesn't 
tell the executable to use it.

I am sorry that I can't help more.

Mark

I forgot to mention that you should replace the "/usr/X11R6/lib/" 
part of the command-line option with whatever directory the librt 
is actually in. My bad.

I am interested in seeing this work, because I just recently 
downloaded BRL-CAD for similar purposes. I wish it had an 
obj-importer, though.

I  tried this configuration yesterday and it works fine. I have to figure out file sharing between operating systems. Parallels allows to run a Linux window in addition to the XP window within the MAC main window.

Ok, maybe it is time to install clean. If there is some admin who wants 
to help, let him install brlcad where it belongs to, somewhere in /usr. 
Than it will also find its libraries. He may also install (if available) 
a package for your distribution, as you do not intend to use the latest 
features but only the (old) import-filter.

The workarounds should come to an end here, as, while you copied some 
files to your current working directory, brldcad heaviely relies on its 
libraries. So it will be easier to properly install the whole package.

The problem is that brlcad expects to be in a standard location under 
/usr, where a non-admin user should not be able to install. There is a 
file README and/or INSTALL which tells you where to install it, for my 
OS X release it was something like /usr/brlcad, afaik.

There is no need to recompile it (except that you insist on installing 
it in a non-standard location. I had hoped that you already successfully 
did all the conversion as I did not hear any news from you.

After all this Radiance-Off-Topic (while interesting, as brlcad is a 
useful extension for radiance in many ways), there is also nice support 
available for brlcad such as an icq-channel, mailing lists, the 
sourceforge forums and, really, a lot of nicely formatted pdf documentation.

It works. The limitation is that only the iges 4 set seams to be 
supported at the moment. I have imported some files, but could not get 
instances loaded, probably because I had iges 5.1 files (from formZ).

I'm interested in using RADIANCE for visual psychophysics. I've done a 
little bit of experimentation with an old laptop running Linux and now 
want to set up a dedicated RADIANCE system. The work I'm intending to 
carry out involves producing fairly large numbers of short animations so 
rendering speed is important but, as I don't want to spend large amounts 
of money, I'm thinking in terms of a consumer-type PC running Linux. Am 
I correct in assuming that rendering performance will be almost entirely 
determined by CPU and memory? I'd be glad of recommendations 
(specifically for using RADIANCE) about CPUs (basically Pentium 4 vs 
Pentium D) and memory (I assume 2G is ample - my scenes only contain 5 
or 10 objects and one or two light sources). Some PC graphics cards 
(e.g. nVidia 6800) claim to handle more that 24 bits per pixel and hence 
support HDR imaging - will these improve the pixel-depth of my RADIANCE 
renders? The system will be calibrated with a spectroradiometer so we 
really can exploit improved colour resolution if it is there to be had!

many thanks,

Radiance is a purely software renderer, so the ability of the graphics card
makes no difference. It's all CPU and memory. Memory is pretty cheap now,
so get a few gigs of it and you'll be happy.

I'd steer clear of the Pentium 4 - even Intel has ditched that failed
architecture. It has a very long pipeline, so any branch miss-prediction
is very expensive performance-wise. For their Pentium-M and new CPU's
Intel went back to the Pentium-III and the P6 core.

I'm an AMD fan myself, so I'd recommend an Athlon-64 or Opeteron.
I've heard that the new Intel 'Core' processors are doing pretty well,
even though they don't include the EM64T 64-bit extensions they copied
from AMD. They should do well, but definitely stay away from the Pentium 4!

Bob,

With 5-10 objects and 1 or two light sources, you probably won't 
need much RAM, actually. That is, unless each object has 10^6 
triangles.

Nevertheless, I have compiled performance numbers sent in from 
many generous Radiance users at

http://mark.technolope.org/pages/rad_bench.html

I hope this helps you choose your CPU, and gives you hints for 
custom compile options.

Hi Bob,

I'll chip into what Mark and Ian indicated. First off Mark's benchmark 
page is very useful, so do make sure to take a look. All of our 
production render servers are dual cpu AMD machines, these range from 
some of the first Athlon MP systems to more recent Opterons. We have not 
yet had the opportunity to look at any dual core systems, when we do AMD 
will be the top of the list. It has been many years since I really 
looked into it carefully. But initially the price/perfomance was pretty 
well in AMD's favor. You might want to pole more broadly among others 
doing scientific simulation (cfd for example) and see what kind of 
hardware they are using.

As far as graphics cards are concerned, this does not effect rendering 
speed, however it may have some impact on viewing the images, perhaps 
others can provide some good input on this particularly from the 
standpoint of calibration...? It might also be interesting to see 
if/when (and how much) the new HDR display devices will be available and 
what some of the hardware requirements are.

I would certainly suggest 2G of RAM, this should not increase the price 
very much. If you do not want to do a dual processor system, you can 
probably assemble a cheap system from parts for ~$800 or less (this 
asssumes a downloaded linux distribution such as Fedora Core), which I 
think is amazing compared to what I remember paying for our first 
production machines back in 1996 (~$4,000 per machine, ouch).

Message-ID: <1694.209.189.225.226.1151300738.squirrel@neoweb.tamu.edu>

Currently I am modelling a rectangularspace with wind tower, the wind tower
extends 3 meters above the roof of the space with openings from the four
sides. The wind tower dimension is 2X2 meters.It does not have glazing I
am using special illum on the opening of it. The material inside the
windtower is non reflective, made with stucco, reflectivity of almost 85%
I wanted to know what would be the best ambient bounces to use while
simulating it since two sincers wher placed in side the space, one sensor
is placed directly under the windtower, and the other one is at the center
of the space.

Thank you,
Maitha

Usually it helps to draw a section of the room.

Indirect component from sky - 1 bounce.
Interreflection in the tower (I guess you mean no SPECULAR reflection, 
cannot ?magine non-reflective surfaces there) - 1 or two more bounces.
Now you want to consider that even the room's ceiling gets some light 
from the tower, which is reflected by walls and floor (are there any 
other openings to illuminate the room?), so add one or two.

All in all I get between 3 and 5 bounces. If you use rad and a rif file, 
note that the quality setting influences the ambient bounces calculated.

BTW, if you use an illum surface, you will need far less. How important 
is it to get "nice" pictures in your case?

CU Lars.

If you are using Radiance under UNIX, then a script to test for  
convergence may help.  Have a look at the example in Section 6.4 of  
the Radiance book.

Dear all
I'm looking into buying a Luminance meter in order to carry out some light
measurements in urban open spaces. The ideia is to have some sort of
reference values in key open spaces of different configuration and surface
materials, that we can use as a basis to understand what the brightness
values we get in our simulated scenes actually mean in the real world.

I've been looking at Minolta LS100
(http://www.tequipment.net/MinoltaLS100.asp

the price is quite high (more than ?2,000 and as high as ?3,000 in some
websites). I was wondering if this is the sort of price I should expect to
pay for a good meter or if there are others that will do the same job and
are less pricey? Would anyone suggest any other instruments?

Thanks in advance.

Raquel,

We bought an LS100 a year ago.  At the time of choosing, there didn't  
seem to be much in the way of competition, but that may have  
changed.  Regarding your intended use, there are a whole raft of  
confounding factors that can (and invariably do) make comparison of  
measured and modelled values in an urban setting highly problematic.   
I addressed some of these issues in a recent LR&T paper:

Verification of program accuracy for illuminance modelling:  
assumptions, methodology and an examination of conflicting findings
Lighting Research and Technology, Volume 36, Number 3, 1 September  
2004, pp. 217-242.

Abstract:
This paper examines the role of assumptions commonly made in  
validation studies for lighting simulation programs and quantifies  
the sensitivity of results to uncertainties in key model parameters  
such as sky conditions and surface reflectivity. Actually occurring  
overcast skies are often taken to approximate the CIE standard  
overcast sky for the purpose of comparing predictions against  
measurements in real buildings. The validity of this assumption is  
tested against measurements of the sky luminance distribution for  
real skies. Illuminance predictions are particularly sensitive to the  
assigned reflectance of surfaces when the direct component of  
illumination is small. A number of confounding factors that can lead  
to imprecise estimates of surface reflectivity for building facades  
are identified and a methodology to minimize their effect is  
proposed. This study reveals that commonly made assumptions with  
respect to sky conditions and moderate imprecision in model  
parameters can lead to erroneous assessments of program accuracy. The  
degree to which existing validation findings can be extrapolated to  
very different application scenarios is discussed in the context of  
reported conflicting assessments of program accuracy.

Although concerned mainly with illuminance predictions, much of the  
discussion applies also to luminance.  Contact me directly if you  
require a copy of this paper and don't have access to the journal.

Photographic spot meters for luminance measurements, and photographic
incident light meters for illuminance measurements, though it does
take some calculation to go from exposure values to luminance and
illuminance values.  Used photographic meters cost much less than a
new LS100, and there are many good ones available.

See <http://www.vsg.cape.com/~pbaum/meter1.htm>.  If you really need
lots of specific info about light meters, see *The Hand Exposure Meter
Book*, by Hirschfeld, et al. (not seen, but I know one of the authors by reputation).

Hi Chris,

while I dont know anything about this particular program I am rather sure
that this file librt.so.19 is not in your library path.
On my system I issue the following commands to find out more:

# locate librt.so
/lib/librt.so.1
/usr/lib/librt.so

# ls -l /lib/librt.so.1 /usr/lib/librt.so
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 14  5. Mai 03:40 /lib/librt.so.1 -> librt-2.3.6.so
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 20  5. Mai 03:40 /usr/lib/librt.so ->
../../lib/librt.so.1

So the 'real' file is actually here: /lib/librt-2.3.6.so

# file /lib/librt-2.3.6.so tells you:
/lib/librt-2.3.6.so: ELF 32-bit LSB shared object, Intel 80386, version 1
(SYSV), stripped

The other 'files' you find are so called 'symbolic links'. This way
differrent programs looking for this library can find it in different
directories and you still need only one real copy of it, the rest is done
via links.

I guess you should first find out what and where your application (iges-g)
is looking for. Just type the folloing in the directory where your app
lives:

# ldd iges-g

As an example if I want to figure out which libraries 'rpict' needs I type:

# ldd /opt/radiance/bin/rpict
        linux-gate.so.1 =>  (0xffffe000)
        libm.so.6 => /lib/libm.so.6 (0xb7efc000)
        libc.so.6 => /lib/libc.so.6 (0xb7dec000)
        /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0xb7f28000)

This will show you exactlty where your binary finds (or doesn't) the
libaries it needs. Then you can just make a symbolic link from the real
location of 'librt.so' to where it is expected by 'ides-g'.

Hope this gets you started ;-)

There's a program called SPOT (Sensor Placement and Orientation Tool) 
that uses Radiance as a back-end. It's mostly for daylighting and 
electric lighting integration, and it's kind of a pain to get to work 
with your own Radiance models, but there is an excel spreadsheet 
interface that is very easy to use. This ease of use comes at the cost 
of limited features. You can find out more about it here: 
http://www.archenergy.com/SPOT/

Other than that there is always Desktop Radiance: 
http://radsite.lbl.gov/deskrad/dradHOME.html

If anyone else knows of any others, I'd be interested to hear about them 
as well.

Hope that helps!

Although it currently doesn't offer the analysis tools that Radiance  
has, Maxwell has the underlying architecture to make such analysis  
possible.  It wouldn't surprise me to see an announcement at Siggraph  
regarding lighting analysis tools in Maxwell or based on Maxwell.    
Users are certainly asking for it on the Maxwell forums.  This is  
pure speculation on my part.  http://www.maxwellrender.com

Take care,

Chris Jessee

Relux is a windows based program which uses Radiance as an alternative to  
its radiosity module. It is a commercial package, free licences are  
available for non commercial use.

Just to mention such a workflow that works fine:
We have Refelction-X running on the windows-os machines. This tool 
allows us to open a shell using a variety of protocols on every 
unix/linux/mac machine available on the network. Reflection X allows us 
to intertface with Radiance and other unix tools/scripts using a native 
shell/xterminal from the unix box (bash, csh, etc) on a Windows pc 
(which runs 3d modelling, photoshop etc.). Reflection-X also allows rvu 
being displayed on a windows machine. This workflow asks for at least 
one 'radiance server' and a windows workstation. Reflection X is 
commercial software, I bought it for a low price from 2nd hand, but it 
is quite expensive new. There are other, cheaper comparable apps 
available which I do not recall at the moment.

Is there a stand alone version of Radiance that has some sort of interface
of which you can in import complex geometery?

Hi Iebele,

It sound's like Reflection X is a commercial X server? Some other 
applications to consider that enable X on Windows might be:

    * Cygwing with XFree - I know that some people have bashed Radiance
      on Cygwin a bit, but getting the basic Cygwin plus X has be quite
      a reasonable solution for running remote X sessions to our Linux
      Radiance servers.
    * Mix - this is a commercial application that we have used in the
      past, it is quite stable. It is just an X server so it does not
      come with some of the applicaitons that a Cygwin setup might have.
      The cost is very reasonable ($25 US), check out:
      http://www.microimages.com/mix/

An alternative to all of this would be to run a VNC server/client setup. 
Check out http://www.realvnc.com/ where they have free and commercial 
clients and servers. This would provide the whole remote desktop in a 
window on the local host.

Note also if you want to consolidate resources, instead of having two 
pieces of hardware (windows box and linux box), you can try vmware 
(www.vmware.com) to run a virtual instance of one operating system 
within another. Thus giving you two "machines" on the same (1) physical 
piece of hardware. I think I posted on this earlier.

Regards,

-Jack

What exactly do you mean? First, you know radiance-online.org?

If you mean stand-alone as independant from a specific cad, but with 
GUI, again, I recommend a look at rayfront from schorsch.com. It CAN be 
stand-alone as well as AutoCAD-integrated.

Without GUI, any Radiance-release for windows is able to import complex 
geometry over the command-line interface, e.g. the conversion filters.

CU Lars.

Thankds for the responce.
Then I guess my second question is how can I get a copy of Radiance?

Hi Charlie,

You should really take a look at: http://www.radiance-online.org/

See the Software section on the left hand side for a variety of download 
options.

One advantage with Cygwin is that it handles the annoying end of space character incompatibility very well.  So it does not matter if you edit a script in windows or unix.  It will still work.

Hi David,

I'm sure Zack Rogers appreciates your plug for the program he developed 
(BTW, the words behind the acronym have changed to "Sensor Placement and 
Optimization Tool")!  I've had a chance to use SPOT a fair amount since 
coming to AEC, where Zack wrote the program.

You have hit the nail on the head there, GUIs ease the learning curve 
pain at the expense of inherently limiting what you can do with the 
underlying software.  This becomes painfully evident with a program as 
powerful and flexible as Radiance.  But SPOT does allow one to analyze 
simple spaces with Radiance (as well as perform some pretty 
sophisticated photosensor correlation analysis), and I believe a CAD 
model import tool is on the "long-term to-do list".

I also believe that Georg has created the ultimate GUI for Radiance with 
his Rayfront product, as it really allows you to delve pretty deeply 
into the underlying complexities and capabilities of Radiance.

Maxwell has been vaguely promising lighting analysis tools for almost 
two years now, but nothing concrete has emerged and they have missed 
release dates, angering pre-release purchasers.  You raise a good point 
though, perhaps a third party will take the reins and create a plug-in 
or something that would allow that.  Of course at that point you still 
have something that has not been extensively validated -- validation 
being one of many positive traits of Radiance and a benefit of its being 
around for so long.
