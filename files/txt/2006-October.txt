Thanks for the mkillum suggestion Greg!

Just to have a complete understanding of setting -ar to 0, which is an
interesting idea: is it something as setting the ambient radius to a pixel?
Recently Mental Ray allowed setting its final gathering based on pixel
radii, which is actually a very neat idea. How would such an approach work
on Radiance? I remember it's been quite a help, but am not sure if it would
make sense for Radiance. 

Cheers,

Hi, I've been having trouble connecting to the Radiance home page recently.
Is this server mirrored anywhere or will I just have to wait patiently until
someone plugs it back in at the wall or does whatever is necessary to get it
working again?

Hi Jelle,

Setting -ar 0 effectively makes the minimum sampling distance a  
pixel, while eliminating the "maximum sampling distance" which is  
related to the -ar setting when it is non-zero.  This is sometimes  
necessary in very large scenes.

Danny Fuller was on vacation, and just got back to reset the server.   
I don't know what happened, but it's up again.  There isn't a mirror,

Jack suggests a good trick.  I've often resorted to mkillum with  
challenging exteriors setting -aa 0 for the mkillum process, then  
switching the cache back on for the interior renderings (as needed).   
This is what we did on the New York Times model (sponsored by NYSERDA).

Hi Martin,

It's up to LBNL and the people who funded it, I suppose.  You should  
write to Eleanor to ask.  I have no problem sharing the model, but  
bear in mind that it's more like a set of scripts than a model.  We  
only ever look at one floor at a time, since constructing the whole  
tower with all those thousands of tubes would be a waste of  
resources.  Also, there is the urban model to consider.  I'm not sure  
we even have the rights to distribute that.

Hi Rob,

This is just traditional time reporting on most Unix's.  "u" is short  
for "user" time, or time spent in normal execution mode.  The "s" is  
for "system" time, or time spent executing system calls -- usually  
disk i/o and the like.  The final "r" is "real" time, or hours passed  
in total, and gives an idea of what percentage of the cpu you are  
getting, e.g. (50.244+0.452)/53.318 means you're getting 95% of the  
processor.

Install Ubuntu linux on top of Microsoft Virtuap PC (freeware too) program
on Windows and install Radiance on it. If you connect one of your windows
drive to your Ubuntu through network, you can use files from both the
operating systems.

Cheers,
Ramana.

I have a student who is currently designing a museum for his
dissertation. Can anyone offer advice in modelling this
Light-transmitting Concrete
(http://www.litracon.hu/building-blocks.php)?

For those who have never heard of this material before, it is basically
concrete with embedded optical fibres.
Initial thoughts are to model as 'trans' material modified with a dirty
function for the opaque areas, though there is a definite suggestion
that the optic fibres be arranged in rows or columns within the block.

Hi Terry,

This is no help, really, but I would suggest transdata with some  
appropriate angular measurements.  Are there any?  Plain  
transmittance isn't enough to capture the distribution of light,  
which I wouldn't expect to be diffuse.  In the absence of any  
measurements, I suppose you have to assume it's close to diffuse and  
use their value of 3% of 88% for 4% fiber volume density.  So, that  
works out to a formula of:

	transmittance = 0.66 * fiber_density

You can then plug this into a trans primitive:

conc_pattern trans litracon_TM
0
0
7 {refl+trans} {refl+trans} {refl+trans} 0 0 {trans} 0

(Replacing the things in curly braces with appropriate values.)  I  
don't know what the reflectance is -- between 10% and 30% I suppose  
but they don't say.  As for the concrete pattern, you can use a noise  
function if you like, but I doubt it would look very convincing up  
close:

void brightfunc conc_pattern
2 '1+0.2*fnoise3({sca}*Px,{sca}*Py,{sca}*Pz)' .
0
0

You'll have to pick the scale to suit your coordinates, and you may  
want to use different ones for Px, Py, and Pz to get a grain  
appearance, for example.

-Greg

Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance 3.8 release announcement
Message-ID: <0DDC274D-9A37-46AE-8CE7-97FE5B188D9D@gmail.com>

Hi All,

It's been a bit delayed this year, but I finally put together an  
official 3.8 release, with Peter Apian-Bennewitz's help.  There isn't  
a lot of new functionality over 3.7, but there are some important bug  
fixes, and I expect this release to be especially stable as it's been  
under test for many months.  A complete list of changes can be found at:

	http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/Notes/ReleaseNotes.html

The more significant additions and changes are excerpted at the end  
of this message.

We have compiled binaries for Linux (Linux Debian Intel, Sarge) and  
Mac OS X (10.4 Tiger, Universal PPC/Intel).  Sources and binaries are  
available from:

	http://www.radiance-online.org/software		(Freiburg, Germany)

	http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/framed.html	(Berkeley, California)

If I get some requests for FreeBSD binaries (please specify version),  
I'll see what I can do.  It should compile without too much trouble  
under FreeBSD, which is substantially similar to Mac OS X.  Remember  
if you do download the binaries to also pick up the whole  
distribution and run "./makeall library" in the ray directory to  
install them.

If you have time and haven't gotten to it yet, please help us out by  
answering Peter's online survey:

	http://www.radiance-online.org/survey1

As always, let me know if you run into any problems compiling or  
applying the new release.

Cheers,
-Greg

-----------------------------------------------
Changes since 3.7.2 patch release
-----------------------------------------------

Created fieldcomb script to combine alternate fields in a rendering
sequence.  (Development generously sponsored by Iebele Abel.)

Added missing preload of mesh objects for more efficient memory use
during parallel rendering -- this was a serious oversight.

Created ran2tiff program to automate exposure setting of animation
sequences using a moving histogram in combination with pcond, and
converting frames to TIFF.

Added -pj option to vwrays to allow jittering of sample locations.

Rearranged struct's for better efficiency on 64-bit architectures.

Added -i option to rlam so it works with binary input formats.

Improved color scale for falsecolor output.

Added threshold test for Fresnel approximation to prevent its use
on smooth surfaces with unrealistically low specularities (less than  
1.8%).
Water has a specular reflectance of 2.1% at room temperture.

Removed NICE macro settings in rpict and rtrace, which was slowing down
the processes under Mac OS X (10.4) by about 60% due to processor  
napping.

Fixed problem in genblinds, where it was generating slats that were too
wide with the +/-r option.  (Thanks to Helena Buelow-Huebe for  
discovering
this bug.)

Added -V option to rtcontrib to report actual contributions, rather than
just ray coefficients.

Fixed problem with large sample sets, so -u+ option now is truly random.
Thanks to Rick Mistrick and Younju Yoon for identifying this problem,
which was related to a poorly designed hash function.

Changed -u+ to be the default setting in rtrace (only).

Created optics2rad.csh script to convert from Optics 5 material output
to something correct for Radiance.  Built on old glazing.cal function,
which is actually incorrect so removed from the distribution.

Fixed nuisance bug in ximage under some SGI machines that caused it to
choose an inappropriate visual and display incorrect colors.  (Thanks
to Oskar Itzinger for debugging the problem.)

Fixed bug related to alias of alias.

****** COMPATIBILITY CHANGE ********
Changed default sky turbidity in gensky from the original default of
2.75 to the CIE 110-1994 standard value of 2.45.  Thanks to Marilyne
Anderson of MIT for pointing out this discrepancy.

Added -o option to ra_xyze to produce original pixel values.

Fixed bug in tracing of virtual sources, where intervening glazing was
not being accounted for properly.

Added -h option to pcompos and pcomb to eliminate verbose headers.

Yes, that is a good affordable option. I would like to have precise indicators for azimuth and altitude, if possible.

Have you looked at the "Panosaurus"?

Hi Martin,

Just as another option (I do not have one, nor had a chance to try it 
out). Bogen has a quicktime vr tripod head:

    http://www.calumetphoto.com/item/BG3037.html

Obviously this is a lot more expensive than the Panosaurus, but it may 
have finer graduation on the various positioning elements.

Another thing to think about is having a solid/stable enough tripod for 
the camera you want to use.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance documentation organization
Message-ID: <BF9D74D0-E5F6-4B7C-9559-C6DD1419D786@gmail.com>

I promised at the Leicester workshop to propose a hierarchy for  
extant Radiance documentation, sort of a straw man to get people  
thinking about this.  I strongly encourage others to rearrange these  
topics, change names, add categories, etc.

Thinking about it for a bit, I opted for a functional organization  
over an application-based hierarchy, simply because so many tools and  
techniques are common to different applications, and I was trying to  
keep the organization as tree-like as possible, realizing that this  
goal is basically unachievable.

Caveats aside, here's what I have:

I. Input
	A. CAD links and conversion tools
	B. Photometry & Sky models
	C. Generator programs
	D. Scene processing (xform, replmarks, oconv, etc.)

II. Computation
	A. Rendering (batch & interactive)
	B. Illumination calculations
	C. Executive programs (rad, rayfront, etc.)

III. Output
	A. Image processing
	B. Image viewing
	C. Image format conversion
	D. Graphing & plotting

In addition, I suggest we include an alternate arrangement of  
tutorial materials, which necessarily bridge these functional  
boundaries.  I am hoping others can offer suggestions for how these  
should be organized, as I don't even have a good list of tutorials  
available.

Some thought should also be given to how one might organize materials  
from the Radiance workshops.  Again, the basic categories above will  
be bridged or extended by many of the talks, and the chronological  
arrangement we now have is of less and less use as time goes on.

Help, please!
-Greg

I think a functional organization fits the need of the user most, 
indeed. Applications and tutorials might be added to the end of the 
list, just for those who want to browse through them, which can be very 
learnfull for both beginners and experienced users.
Every search in the tree will end in some article. If just each article 
will end with related tutorials and applications, that in itself is a 
way of organizing tutorials and applications.

What might be added is an Installation chapter, which covers also 
different platforms, different shells and additional software 
developments like radzilla.

I don't know what you exectly have in mind, but as you say : "help, 
please!", using wikipedia  (there already is a small wiki about Radiance 
software) might be an option to have lots of us working on the same 
documentation. If those who now are active in this mailinglist spent 
just some time in writing articles and updating hyperlinks now and then, 
then over some years a real nice documentation will be just there. 
Wikipedia also has an option for creating Wiki-books as pdf.

I like Leble's suggestions, particularly using Wikipedia.  Wouldn't  
Wikipedia reduce the burden on individuals?  Is there any  
disadvantage to using Wikipedia?

Take care,

Hi Iebele,

Good point about installation.  That definitely deserves its own  
category, which I simply forgot.  I've also added a tutorials  
section, which we may as well break into categories as well:

I. Installation and Set-up
	A. Standard (UNIX) distirbution
	B. Radzilla
	C. Windows alternatives
	D. Other packages

II. Tutorials
	A. Basic
	B. General, Advanced
	B. Electric Lighting
	C. Daylighting

III. Input
	A. CAD links and conversion tools
	B. Photometry & Sky models
	C. Generator programs
	D. Scene processing (xform, replmarks, oconv, etc.)

IV. Computation
	A. Rendering (batch & interactive)
	B. Illumination calculations
	C. Executive programs (rad, rayfront, etc.)

V. Output
	A. Image processing
	B. Image viewing
	C. Image format conversion
	D. Graphing & plotting

Regarding Wikipedia, I think the discussion we had at the workshop  
was leaning towards a more controlled environment, where people would  
still be very free to contribute but responsible for particular parts  
of the documentation tree.  This was the plone-based solution that  
Peter Apian-Bennewitz proposed last year.  Much hints on getting some  
seed (and hopefully ongoing) funding for that.

Hi Greg, everyone,

 From the 3.8 Release Notes:
"Renamed librt.a to librtrad.a, to avoid conflict on Solaris. Almost
everything now gets linked to -lrtrad instead of -lrt."

I just tried compiling the new source on a SuSe box here, and got a 
bunch of  "cannot find -ltrad" errors.  Do I need to be doing something 
different, here?

Hi Rob,

You're not the first to make the mistake of using Windows in a  
misguided attempt to get some work done...

End of line in Unix is "line-feed" (hex 0A), "carriage-return" (hex  
0D) in pre-X MacOS, and carriage-return followed by line-feed in  
Windows (inherited from DOS, inherited from CP/M).  This has caused  
more headaches over the years than just about all the other divergent  
standards combined, including the '/' '\' stupidity between DOS/VAX  
and Unix.

Cool, thanks for the education on the various EOL variants, but I'm  
really a lot more excited about the fact that my calling myself an  
idiot is now a matter of public record, on the radiance-online  
archives.  Excellent!  =8-)

Hi all,
does anybody knows how I can simulate perforated curved aluminum
lamellas? Which material is recommended to get plausible values (for
reflection (on aluminum and transmission (through the gaps) by using a
sunny and overcast sky in my simulation model? The result should be the
illuminance level and respectively Daylight factor inside.
The lamellas are just rotatable but not movable, the perforation is
fixed with 15% (whitout knowing exactly the design of the longish small
holes) and should be used like lightshelves in front of heat-protection
glass. 
 
Thanks for help!

Greg, How difficult would it be to adapt this for pict output?
I could run a photoshop batch on the completed tiffs, but wondered if it can
be done in a script.
I see the call to ra_tiff at the bottom of the script. Would ra_pict apply
the same?

Or - does anyone have suggestions for a cheap or free Mac moviemaker from
tiff to Quicktime?
iMovie treats each image as a 5 second graphic, not one frame
I've been using Moover, a Mac OS9 app that converts picts to QT.

Created ran2tiff program to automate exposure setting of animation sequences
using a moving histogram in combination with pcond, and converting frames to
TIFF.

Hi Rob,

It's not difficult to replace ra_tiff with ra_pict in ran2tiff, which  
I've done for you in the attached (untested) script.

If you can spare $30 (US price), QuickTime Pro is a real bargain  
<http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore?

Hi Friedemann,

I was hoping someone else who knew more about this material might  
respond, but maybe no one does...

If you want an accurate model of this material, you need to use the  
geometric cross-section and the material properties to create an  
analytic estimate of the integrated light transfer.  In other words,  
it ain't easy.  Better still, you would obtain measurements of the  
angular transmission of the material, but this poses an even greater  
challenge.

A couple of years ago, Visarc hired me to create a mathematical model  
of transmission through a grid structure, simulated as rectangular  
holes in a diffuse structure.  The associated calculation is  
contained in grating.cal in the standard distribution.  If your holes  
are oval rather than rectangular, this won't be as accurate, but it  
might be a start.  If your surface is specular and you wish to  
capture the change in specular reflectance with angle, more work is  
needed.

Wouldn't the transmission and distribution vary depending on the angle of the lamellas?  These are like perforated metal mini blinds right?
