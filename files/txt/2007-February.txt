Thanks for help, Jack and Christoph,
 
I know about the wonderful rayfront user manuel from Schorsch, espacially the nice diagram, but
the description of trans I found there is a little bit imprecise if "spec" is speciefied with   "Values greater than 0.1 are unusual". Does "unusual" mean impossible for RADIANCE to calculate correct if a greater values is set? Is there an other reason which I should know?
An other question about "trans" is if it transmits only direct source rays or additionally diffuse one (i.e. from sky hemisphere)
Jack, I wasn't interrested about the absorption caused by color filtering, my focus was only  on reflected specularity. For more realistic renderings I should use other parameters, of course. By the way: I can count myself lucky to say that there are no "other basic problems" to assign the matirial to my model...
 
Thanks for additional comments!
Friedemann

	Hi All,
	
	Yes, trans is very confusing. The link to Schorsch's page is very helpful, particularly the diagram. You should also look at pages 325 and 326 of Rendering with Radiance to see how parameters for the trans material can be derived. It would probably also be worthwhile to do a search on the archives as the trans material is a recurring topic of question, discussion and answer.
	
	I am a bit unclear though about the makeup of your material. You use the word "screen" to describe it, this could be interpreted as a material that actually has holes in it, in which case the material would also need to have a specular transmittance component (arg 7), that is the portion of light that pass un-diffused through the material. I am not sure but this might even need a more complex material description.
	
	Also you may have some more basic problems in the definition of your material. You have the following:
	

		screen trans spec-diff_80-10
		0
		0
		7 1 1 1 .8 0 .1 0
		

	Note that this implies that there is actually some material modifier called "screen" that is modifying the material (of type trans) called "spec-diff_80-10". Is this what you intend? Or do you mean:
	

		void trans screen
		0
		0
		7 1 1 1 .8 0 .1 0
		

	where "screen" then gets applied to geometry?
	
	Note one other item. I believe that it would be extremely unusual for the first three parameters to be 1 1 1. Schorsch's page indicates a realistic range of .2 to .9. The first three arguments are derived based on the interaction of the "diffuse" reflectance of the material with the "reflected specularity" (arg 4) and along with (arg 6). 
	
	Regards,

		Hi all,
		I should simulate a screen material with highly specular reflection (0.8) at one side like aluminized matrial  an a totally diffuse transmission of  about 0.1.
		The parameter of spec for trans material isn't described very well in 'Rendering with Radiance' so I couldn't understand it. Does a numer of 1 spec means a totally specularity for diffuse and direct light ? If so should I use somthing like this:
		 
		screen trans spec-diff_80-10
		0 0 7 1 1 1 .8 0 .1 0
		 
		correct? Or does anybody know a BRTDfunc material definition for this issue?

Hi Friedmann,

I believe that the specularity of common uncoated glass is around  .06, 
so perhaps this is where this range is coming from. Perhaps if the 
system was a translucent glazing system with some kind of additional 
coating the specular component might be higher.

Regarding your comment on absorption. It is actually important to base 
your material on reasonable estimates for the initial parameters as 
described in RwR, as these have impact on the values used for the 
arguments to the material. As you see in the formula's in the book the 
parameters all interact with each other.

-Jack

Message-ID: <10187.213.58.97.18.1170343073.squirrel@webmail2.londonmet.ac.uk>

Dear all,

I'm trying to process an HDR image to pick out the light source. The image
was taken with hdrgen:
RGBE: http://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/pickup/004.hdr
falsecolor: http://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/pickup/004_fc.jpg
Header:
$ head -10 004.hdr
#?RADIANCE
CAMERA= NIKON E990 version E990v1.1
hdrgen created HDR image from '0129_012.jpg' '0129_011.jpg' '0129_010.jpg'
'0129_009.jpg' '0129_008.jpg' '0129_007.jpg' '0129_006.jpg' '0129_005.jpg'
'0129_004.jpg' '0129_003.jpg' '0129_002.jpg' '0129_001.jpg'
Removed lens flare
EXPOSURE=4.175030e-01
CAPDATE= 2007:01:29 17:33:57
PRIMARIES= 0.6400 0.3300 0.3000 0.6000 0.1500 0.0600 0.3127 0.3290
FORMAT=32-bit_rle_rgbe
-Y 768 +X 1024

What I'm after is to black out all pixels below a certain threshold, and
leave all others, i.e. the ones that are part of the light source
untouched.

Firstly, a quick test-run to warm up:
$ pcomb -e 'lo=li(1)' -o 004.hdr > test.pic ; ximage test.pic &
This does nothing but show the brightness. The -o ensures I get
photometric units.

Fine so far. BUT: If I run the same command straight into ximage, the
picture looks the same, but hitting 'L' displays a luminance of 0.0 for
all pixels (the square light source should have a luminance of just under
500 cd/m2):
$ pcomb -e 'lo=li(1)' -o 004.hdr |ximage
This is the first thing that I don't understand.

Second question: To set the threshold to 400 cd/m2 like described above, I
run:
$ pcomb -e 'lo=if(li(1)-400/WE,li(1),0)' -o 004.hdr > test.pic ; ximage
test.pic &
WE is the white efficacy, which seems to be read-only: Setting WE=2000
doesn't do anything.
URL: http://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/pickup/400.png (the light only --
rest is black)

>From pcomb(1):
"... WE gives the white efficacy (lumens/brightness) for pixel values,
which may be used with the -o option or the  le(n) values to convert to
absolute photometric units (see below)"

The exposure value le(n) is the same for the entire picture (in my case
just over 0.4), so is it correct to say that I only have to worry about it
when combining multiple images? And that WE is equally useful with li(n),
not just li(n) and -o?

So combining multiple images with different exposures would be done like so:
$ pcomb -e 'lo=li(1)/le(1)+li(2)/le(2)' -o 004.hdr 006.hdr > test.pic
Right?

Thanks for shedding some light on the issue.

Cheers

Axel

Hi Axel,

If you want to derive light sources from an HDR you should take a look 
at mksource, this will evaluate the scene and then output as set of 
illum sources.

Hi Axel,

I'm glad Jack answered you, first.  I wouldn't have thought through  
to your purpose to suggest mksource.

Even so, I'd hate to leave your other questions unanswered, so here  
goes...

Ximage doesn't load the original HDR pixels into memory, instead  
relying on the file's presence to query specific values.  If you  
don't give it the file, it disables its query function.

You should EITHER use the -o option (once for each input file), OR  
use le(n) to adjust the exposure, not both.  If the -o option is  
applied to an input image, values you get will already have been  
divided by the associated expousre.

Given what I just said, you would either use:

$ pcomb -e 'lo=li(1)/le(1)+li(2)/le(2)' 004.hdr 006.hdr > test.pic

or:

$ pcomb -e 'lo=li(1)+li(2))' -o 004.hdr -o 006.hdr > test.pic

If you felt like it, you could get the same result from:

$ pcomb -e 'lo=li(1)+li(2)/le(2)' -o 004.hdr 006.hdr > test.pic

but that would be a little twisted...

Thanks for the quick reply,

I'm actually trying to quantify the vignetting and angular response of my
fisheye lens, so mksource (which I did think about using) isn't quite what
I want.

Since this is the most puzzling Radiance feature yet, allow me to get back
to it.

Are you saying that ximage reads the file into memory to display it, but
then relies on additional file reads for 'L'?
If so, then would not -f make sure that all 'L's are read from the
in-memory copy, rather than from the file (which it doesn't)? Or would in
a networked-X scenario the application still pull the pixel luminance over
the network, if called with a file name?

In other words: There are two distinct parts to ximage: the display part,
and the query part, and the two don't know anything about one another?

I've experimented with the -o options ('T'-key), and the results are the
same: zero when input to ximage comes through a pipe, expected value when
read from file:
$ pcomb -e 'lo=li(1)' -o 004.hdr | ximage -ov

> If you don't give it the file, it disables its query function.

So some of the ximage features can not be used when input is STDIN? Is
there a particular reason for implementing it this way?

Aha! This makes it crystal-clear now. Thanks 1000!

Back in the day when memory was not quite so cheap as it is now,  
keeping an entire floating-point buffer for an image, as would be  
required for luminance queries off the standard input, seemed  
unreasonable.  I could copy the standard input to a file and read  
back from that, but it seemed rather too much trouble for a feature  
that may or may not be used in a particular invocation.

In other words, ximage tone-maps the floating-point (RGBE) input data  
into an (at most) 24-bit/pixel buffer to be used for display.   
Storing the original image as well would take more than twice the  
memory, and as I said, it was not so cheap when ximage was written.

I hope this clarifies matters.  A lot of what is in Radiance is  
showing its age in terms of the trade-offs made.  On the positive  
side, I did not encode many limits, so cheap memory has meant larger  
and larger models we can render.  Being stingy has its rewards, too.

Hi Kristopher,

The standard distribution of Radiance (which this list is largely 
dedicated to) does not have an "xform2" command. Perhaps this is 
something special to IES-VE and somehow got messed up with the 
installation of DR? Is it possible to "easily" reinstall your IES-VE or 
the Radiance components that come with IES-VE?

Dear All, 

I am trying to complete some overshadowing comparisons between an existing

images to show the extent of any additional shading from the proposed

I would like to be able to highlight the shadows from each building in a

a bias on the rgb of the sun and combine the images, but I am not sure
whether this would work. 

Can anyone provide me with some guidance.

Many thanks

Nick,
Is Radiance really the right tool to accomplish what you are trying to
do? There is a program www.squ1.com called EcoTect that allows you to
conduct overshadowing studies and select shadow colors for different
objects. A demo is available for download at www.squ1.com. Also, EcoTect
models can be exported to Radiance.

Email me offline if you'd like to discuss further.

Best,
John

Hi Nick,

If you want to do this in Radiance, you can use the "picdiff.cal"  
definitions in ray/src/cal/cal like so:

	pcomb -f picdiff.cal -o sceneA.pic -o sceneB.pic > sceneCmp.pic

This should give you more or less what you're after.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Occluder cache application?
Message-ID: <45D18B48.2070600@gmx.net>

Hi,

as I am going to add some dedicated occluder objects to a rather large 
scene, I would like to understand some more details of how the caching 
works to concentrate my work on the right parts of the scene.

I have a scene with these light sources:

- daylight by gensky, but hidden behind mkillum sources
- groups of small light sources, again hidden in bounding mkillums

Now, I guess that for the direct calculation, I will get some speed when 
the occluders block the small light sources. But what about the light 
sources generated by mkillum?

Than, my scene has one more strange feature. More or less all the outer 
walls are instances. So putting a big occluder around the closed parts 
of the building would speed-up because I do not have to test for light 
sources behind the wall. But the only outer light source there is the 
sky distribution + sun. The sky distribution is an indirect source in 
Radiance afaik, so will I win anything?

Thanks, hope someone can bring some light into my occluded understanding 
of the cache,

Lars.

Just generally, there's not much point in adding dedicated occluders,  
unless your scene contains a lot of octree or mesh instances, which  
aren't included in the standard occluder cache.

Any sources of type "glow" are already blocked by intervening "illum"  
surfaces.  Therefore, additional occluders shouldn't make any  
difference.

Very little -- just the sun left as a light source, and testing  
against a single source is generally faster than any shenanigans.

Dear Radiance Community,

   I'm interested in simulating the glazing and I've checked previous 
posts on modeling the glazing.

   I was trying to use the glaze.csh with a separate glazing input file 
and as I read from the thread, it seems that glaze.csh is very 
sensitive to a spacing of the input header file. I used the header that 
was posted from the thread but it still prompted me with 'bad header'. 
So, I'm not sure whether it's the header or my input lines that didn't 
work.

   I was wondering if someone could share a file with correct spacing 
of header along with sample input lines that would make glaze.csh run 
without error? Thank you very much in advance.

Hi Siritip,

If this is the header file that I posted awhile ago, I think it is ok, 
however you may need to add an end-of-line to the file.

Hi Jack,

   Thank you so much for a prompt reply. Yes, I was using the header 
that you posted in the thread. I checked the file in vi and it seems to 
be ok. Here's what it looks like. (I use the data from glaze.csh in 
this case.)

Surface   Tr   Tg   Tb   Rcr   Rcg   Rcb   Rgr   Rgg   Rgb   Part
a   0.862   .89   .886   .074   .077   .079   .074   .077   .079   0
b   0.756   0.808   0.744   0.042   0.049   0.043   0.065   0.058   0.067   0
     I'm not sure if there is something wrong in the glazing input 
lines. (I'm a novice in both Unix and Radiance :)

Thank you very much.
Siritip

Hi Siritip,

If this is the header file that I posted awhile ago, I think it is ok,
however you may need to add an end-of-line to the file.

Hi Siritip,

Every element in the file should be separated by one tab only, do not 
use spaces. At the end of your last line (eg the "b" glazing) you should 
have a carriage return.

I just tested this and it should work fine.

Subject: [Radiance-general] contour lines
Message-ID: <BAY111-F313CDF126D42F5ABBB11D9B0960@phx.gbl>

HI all,
I am new to this site, I have a question to whoever might help;
I have seen that it is possible to visualize contour lines over a set 
reference working plane without it necessarily being an object or surface, 
ie a desk. It would be great to be able to visualize analyses over reference 
planes throughout a room or a space.
Does anybody have a clue how could I do this?

Thanks a lot,
Simon

unless you are a virtuoso of radiance scripting you may do like this:

use rtrace, save point location (x y z) and value or just laminate two files... 

import in any data visualized you may have (opendx, mayavi, paraview, excel(!), matlab....)

if you need the lines and the 3d probably the easiest is paraview.
although my favourite is opendx....

paraview, mayavi, opendx are all free.

Ciao giulio,
immagino tu sia italiano come me....

perdonami , ma sono un principiante in radiance ed ho capito poco e niente 
della tua mail.
ti dico cio' che so invece...
di solito per fare simulazioni di daylight con radiance passo attraverso 
l'interfaccia di ecotect,( questo dovrebbe rassicurarti sulla mia 
virtuosita' in radiance..), per esempio posso visualizzare una reference 
plane reimportando i dati dalla simulazione fatta in radiance.
con radiance invece riesco solo a vedere contour lines sulle superfici della 
stanza invece che su una reference plane.
che posso fare?
ti ringrazio
Simone

se mi mandi la tua email ti spiego.

just  have a look on google for paraview.
then look in ecotect manual for saving data from calculation...
the try to used the exported data with paraview.
(also ecotect does quite a bit on the visualisation side... )

ciao

Hi again,

   Thank you so much. I got the file to be added finally. One question 
is that, after new types were added to supported surface types, then, 
when I select the glazing type, it exits as "Missing -."       I 
selected one clear glass layer (1) and another was from the glazing.dat 
which was just added. (My input data was the same as posted yesterday.)

Thank you so much for your help.

Hi Siritip,

Hmm, ok I guess this is another vagary of input for glaze.csh. I got the 
same error that you did. In order to fix this (without messing with the 
script), I made sure that all decimal units are expressed in the form 
"x.x" as opposed to ".x", thus I added 0 to the front of decimals units 
".x". Now it seems to work.

Hi Jack,

   I edited the file as you suggested but still it exits with 
'missing.'. Here's the latest file.

Surface Tr      Tg      Tb      Rcr     Rcg     Rcb     Rgr     Rgg     
Rgb     Part
a       0.862   0.890   0.886   0.074   0.077   0.079   0.074   0.077   
0.079   0
b       0.756   0.808   0.744   0.042   0.049   0.043   0.065   0.058   
0.067   0

I've been testing other options in the input file like having only one 
line input but it still exits after asking for glazing type. I'll try 
to check with it again to see if I could get it to work :)  Thank you 
very much for your help.

Hi Siritip,

Ok, I withdraw my last answer. I re-entered your data from your original 
email. It works fine... as is. So this is a bit puzzling as I cannot get 
the error to reoccur.

Can you try starting from scratch and see what happens?

Also where are you getting your data from?

-Jack

Make sure the end-of-line characters are Unix linefeeds, not the cr-

Hi again,

   I got it to run finally!! Thank you so much for your advice. I 
created the file again using vi and it's running fine now. I think it's 
really the end-of-line thing between unix and windows.

Thank you so much for your help :)

Subject: [Radiance-general] mkillum settings - borrowed light
Message-ID: <092BF7A1BC389E489A69DC764F23CD870B30DC27@exmsp2.perth.ad.curtin.edu.au>

I have a simple two room project with substantial sunshades on the outer
windows. The second room is only lit via 'borrowed' light at the top of
the wall between the two rooms.

My question is: "How to use mkillum with different parameters for the
two sets of windows using rad?"

For the outside windows, genrad suggests a ground ambient level of 68.5
thus I would need to specify an -av 68.5 68.5 68.5, -ab 1 and possibly
s=16 d=8.

For the internal windows, which can be seen through (to the ceiling of
the other room) I am not sure as to the av settings. Tests using the av
68.5 settings, while giving a good gradient, have an odd bright band on
the ceiling, so I assume the av would need to be lower - how to
determine that value or do you simply leave it out.

As I am using trad/rad I want to embed the commands within the window
rad file rather than in the rif 'mkillum=' line. Reading the man page
for mkillum, it suggests that these options can be embedded but have had
no success to date.

Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Regards

Hi!

hm, genrad, not part of the radiance distribution? Is it genrad from 
that old CAD-integration project?

Just add a line at the beginning of the window's scene description:

#@mkillum s=16 d=8

As for specifying different av settings for the windows, I guess things 
will get really complicated when you want to automate the mkillum 
processes. You can specify the mkillum settings in the input file, but 
what you want to set (av, ar, ...) are the rtrace parameters that 
mkillums uses when starting rtrace processes.

Do you really need different av's? I'd increase the overall ambient 
accuracy, set a high ab (not needed for the outer windows, but it is not 
so important in rendering times if only used for the illum generation).

Good luck! Lars.

Hi,

this is a really late follow-up...

I am having still these problems from time to time, and while I can 
debug that, I am curious about the consequences of this overflow.

When one modifier has been "instanced" too many times, what effect does 
this have for the exclude list? Will all the "instances" of the modifier 
up to the limit still be excluded? Will the modifier who has been 
instanced too often be not excluded at all, but other modifiers which 
are in the range still get excluded when on the exclude list? Or will 
the whole exclude list be ignored if one modifier causes the overrun?

TIA+CU, Lars.

Hello Lars,

Thanks for the tips. 

Hmmm....

The genrad program is from the work of Simon Crone: "The genrad program has
been written to supply calculated direct and diffuse radiation to either of
the two RADIANCE sky distribution programs (gensky and gendaylit), where no
measured data is available."

It supposedly produces more realistic skies especially for Perth (Western
Australia)

Hi Lars,

I had to check the code, myself.  Up to the limit (2047 in the  
current release), you can add modifiers to include or exclude,  
counting each once per appearance on the input.  (Actual instances  
containing materials count only once per, but repeating the same  
material name over and over does count.)  After the limit is reached,  
a warning is issued and further modifiers that should be on the list  
are silently ignored.  It still counts the ones up until that point.

As for Terry's question, your answer is correct about the #@mkillum  
lines on the input.  You cannot have different rtrace settings on a  
per-illum basis, however.  You can have different ones for mkillum  
than the rest of the process, by using a different setting for  
render= and mkillum= in the rad input file.

Hope this clears things up.
-Greg

Hi,

I wonder if you know these, I just found them:

Control Panel: http://squ1.com/node/201
Image Viewer:  http://squ1.com/node/1419

Usually I am not so much in Windows software, but these are even not 
linked in radiance-online, and there is some folks working on 
windows-boxes out there.

CU Lars.

Funny, I also just recently found them. Maybe they didn't have them online before? And I agree, esp. the Radiance Control Panel could be of some use for Win*-users.

Does the software allow you to print images and save the image files?  I've been using HDRVIEW under windows which works great.  I only wish it had better printing and saving capabilities.

This is very handy if you run radiance under Cygwin or something similar.

Dear group,

I'm wondering whether pure monte carlo sampling (-u+) has become the default
setting in the current binary linux distribution for rtrace/rpict, rather
than the classic quasi monte carlo sampling (-u-).
I'm working on a project where it is important to have the same results
returned whenever a simulation is ran multiple times.

Thanks!

Hi Jelle,

Run rtrace -defaults or rpict -defaults to find out.  You'll see that  
it's now the default for rtrace, but rpict still defaults to -u-.   
Nevertheless, there are no true guarantees that two subsequent runs  
will have completely identical results if there are subtle  
differences in the input, which \ cause different sampling patterns  
due to certain thresholds being met or not during rendering.

-Greg
