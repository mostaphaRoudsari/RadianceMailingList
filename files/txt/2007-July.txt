Hi Tim,

I had to struggle a bit to understand what you were after here.  I  
recommend the following options:

	rtrace -dr 1 -lr 1 -dp 0 -ds 0.02 -dj 0 -dt 0 -lw 0 -ab 0 -I+ -h- - 
w- -oTopn

By replacing 't' in the output options with 'T', you force inclusion  
of all rays to light sources.  I'm not sure if this is what you want,  
but you can try it.

As for the problem of sources being too close in Z, it might be  
better to take a different strategy.  Place a vertical surface that's  
set on one of the diagonals between the corners of your room --  
assuming your room has a roughly triangular shape.  Make the surface  
a "trans" type:

	void trans diffuse
	0
	0
	7 1 1 1 0 0 .5 0

Then, trace rays onto the center of the surface from either side and  
follow the reflections.  That way, you'll get rays going out both sides.

By the way, why don't you just compute what you're after from  
straight geometry?  Is the space so complicated?

Subject: [Radiance-general] Triple glazing simulation
Message-ID: <20070711103325.9vj39i6tc00wg00s@webmail.bankerinter.net>

Hi all,

I have to model the behavior of triple glazing made of 3 clear glass  
panes. Each pane is ordinary 4mm clear glass with transmittance 0.91.

For double glazing simulation I use glaze.csh script, but I don't have  
an idea how triple glazing can be simulated. I suppose I should use  
some BRTDfunc material with transmittance angle distribution similar  
to my glazing system.

I didn't manage to find anything on Internet, so hints, ideas and  
examples are very welcome!
Since I can see that triple glazings gain the popularity, I suppose  
this subject is interesting to other members too.

Thanks,
Marija

Hi Marija,

If you copy the glaze2.cal script and rename it "glaze3.cal", adding  
the following lines to the end of the file:

                                 { simple triple-pane reflectance }
cr3(r,t) :  r*(1 + t*t*(1 + t*t));

-------
Your glazing definition is then:

void BRTDfunc glaze3_unnamed
10
cr3(fr(0.074),ft(0.91))
cr3(fr(0.074),ft(0.91))
cr3(fr(0.074),ft(0.91))
ft(0.91)^3
ft(0.91)^3
ft(0.91)^3
         0 0 0
         glaze3.cal
0
9
         0 0 0
         0 0 0
         0 0 0

We probably should add a third glazing to the glaze.csh script, but  
it would complicate it by an order of magnitude due to the number of  
combinations involved.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Modelling lightwell with translucent glazing
Message-ID: <s6954d24.087@rwdi.com>

Hello,

I am a relative newcomer to Radiance, so please forgive my ignorance.

I am interested in simulating a room with a deep lightwell as the only
source. The top of the light well has a double glazed skylight and the
bottom of the lightwell is an as-yet undefined product that produces
diffuse light and has a very high visible light transmittance. My
questions are:

1. Will a light frit or white paint coating on glass transmit highly
diffused light? If not, any products to recommend that will?
2. Will Lamberts cosine law be a reasonable estimate for the BTDF and
BRDF? And what are reasonable peak (zero angle) values to expect?
3. Am I going to run into problems with Radiance finding the light
source? Which inputs will help Radiance find the light?

Thanks for any guidance.

Hi ---

I've written a .cal shader for use with colorpict that makes use of Nx, 
Ny and Nz.  But now I want to apply it to a mesh, (or object generated 
with gensurf with the smoothing option on).  Instead of receiving the 
perturbed (interpolated) vertex normals, it just applies to the local

How do I access the interpolated surface normals in a .cal file?

What is "full raytracing" here? I think it is best here to replace the glazing by a mkillum pane and, if the shading system masks the window in a way that you expect variying illumination, subdivide that illum face a bit (see mkillum manpage). Without the illum pane, you might "measure" the max/min values of an inaccurate raytracing, sometimes light sources found, sometimes not, purely by luck ;-)

Hi Roland,

What is your function file being used for?  If it's one of the BRDF  
types, the NxP, NyP, and NzP variables should be assigned the  
perturbed normal.  You can't generally use a perturbed normal in a  
pattern or texture.

Simulating Venetian Blinds takes a lot of time if you are using 'pure'
Radiance but it is possible. See e.g.:Reinhart C F, Walkenhorst O,
"Dynamic RADIANCE-based daylight simulations for a full-scale test
office with outer venetian blinds." Energy & Buildings, 33:7 pp.
683-697, 2001.
 
Incidentally, for those of you interested, we have developed a new
daylight coefficient approach where you can simulate a space without
blinds and then multiply your resulting daylight coefficients with a
correction matrix to account for blinds. A rudimentary description of
the method can be downloaded from:

Hello Radiance community

I would like to ask you what is the best way to simulate external blinds
in Radiance. I have tried both full ray-tracing and the mkillum approach
but they do not yield the same illuminance values on the working plane.
Especially close to the window (0.5-1m) large differences show up
(100%).

What is the physically most accurate method? And if it is ray-tracing
how do I obtain smooth results in a reasonable amount of time?

Dear group,

I would like to use the direct solar and diffuse irradiance data from 
TMY weather files for setting the direct and diffuse values in 
Radiance's Gensky program.  Gensky expects values for the visible 
component only, however I'm assuming the TMY data is for the full 
spectrum of light and, as such, must have an appropriate luminous 
efficacy factor applied to it to.  Is this correct? 

Also, I gather that the Gendaylit program will take the weather data as 
input, however I've been unable to find an active link to the program 
for downloading. Does anyone have a link for this?  Thanks in advance 
for any help.

Message-ID: <94590C9AC072E74A8CFCFB5014B2CD271F693F@bdspserver04.BDSPUK02.local>

Hi all,

I've been using rtcontrib recently and I'm having problems finding a set
of rendering parameters (ad and lw) that don't give "out of memory"
errors but do give sufficiently accurate results.

About the highest settings that I can use before an out of memory error
occurs is:
 
cat luxmeters_test_office.txt | rtcontrib -V+ -o solar_coefficients.bin
-M sun_modifiers.txt -fad -ab 5 -ad 4096 -lw 1e-8 -I+ -h
octrees/scene_with_suns.oct

...but when I use these settings the results contain a lot of noise.

The scene consists of a fairly complex building and 72 light sources
(representative suns for the year), each of which has a unique modifier
so that I get a coefficient for each light source at each measurement
point.  

So far I've come up with two possible explanations for my problems:

1. I'm getting my settings all wrong.  I'm using -ad and -lw to control
the accuracy, but I haven't got a good feel for how to vary them -
should I set -ad as I would for a normal rtrace-type calculation and
then reduce lw until I get what I want, or does ad need to be higher for
an rtcontrib type calculation?  Or is there another setting I need to
look at?

2. I'm using cygwin.  Is anyone aware of any memory limitations with
cygwin? I've seen the web page about increasing the memory available to
cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/setup-maxmem.html) and that
didn't help at all - apparently cygwin on my machine has a maximum heap
size of about 1.5Gb.  

Does anyone have any suggestions?

Thanks,

Andy Stone

Chris,

Be wary that gendaylit can produce skies with massive distortions  
(e.g. huge -ve luminance cusps at low altitude) for certain  
combinations of direct, diffuse and solar altitude.  The absolute  
values for these tend to be uninteresting for daylight provision  
(i.e. on the low side), but they could foul-up an automated procedure  
and/or bias output if they are not picked up.  The distortion  
occurred in routine application of UK climate datasets, and I believe  
it has been noted with use of other climate files.  Note that, when  
it occurs, the normalisation to diffuse horizontal is still correct  
-- so you can't test for it by comparing predicted diffuse horizontal  
with the corresponding value from the climate file.  However,  
predictions for vertical illuminances (or light through a window)  
could be way out.  The only safe way to test is to send out a  
hemisphere of rays to the sky and check for any returned -ve  
luminances (replace these instances with CIE overcast).

Hello everybody,

I Shrikar Bhave, am a graduate student in MS - Building Design (Energy
Performance and Climate Responsive Architecture) program at Arizona
State University. I have taken a 'Radiance' course during my MS
curriculum. My thesis deals with daylighting and radiance is primary
software that I am using for my thesis research.

I will be graduating by mid-september, and have started looking for
job. I believe that during my MS curriculum, I have acquired a
skillset appropriate for Building energy analysis and Daylighting
design & analysis.

Daylighting design and analysis is one of my core interests in my
career. I wish to keep working with Radiance during my professional
career to further develop my software knowledge and modelling skills.

Could you please suggest consulting firms (in USA) which use Radiance
(as one of the tools) for daylighting design and analysis ? (and
firms, which might be looking for fresh graduates)

Thanks and regards,

Shrikar

RESEARCH ASSISTANT Post REF: ROP2306

24,402 - 26,666 per annum, (english pounds) depending on skills and
experience. In first instance fixed term for 1 year (maternity cover).

This post is funded via the EPSRC award "High Dynamic Range for High
Fidelity Image Synthesis of Real Scenes". The aim of this project is to
compute and display the highest fidelity computer-generated images of 
real scenes.
You should have proven programming skills in C++ or Matlab and
enthusiasm for problem solving and research. Under the guidance of Dr 
Bloj you will develop a BRDF (Bi-directional Reflectance Distribution 
Function) capture system based on digital photography, implement the 
corresponding model in a rendering package (preferably RADIANCE) and 
support the psychophysical evaluation of the resulting images using 
standard displays and a Brightside DR37-P High Dynamic Range Display.
This represents an exciting opportunity for a promising researcher to 
join a vibrant interdisciplinary team with partners at the Warwick 
Digital Lab and Brightside (now part of DOLBY) working on the 
development and validation of High Dynamic Range capture and display 
systems.
The successful applicant will be based in Dr Bloj's lab in the 
University of Bradford, UK.

Informal enquires can be made to Dr Marina Bloj. Tel +44 (0)1274 236258;
e-mail: M.Bloj@bradford.ac.uk or Dr Alexa Ruppertsberg +44 (01274 
235378; e-mail A.I.Ruppertsberg@bradford.ac.uk .

CLOSING DATE: 13th August 2007. We expect to interview during the week 
of 20th August. Job reference ROP2306.

Hi Derek,

I didn't see any responses to this query, so I guess it fell through  
the cracks.  Sorry about that.  Some quick, feeble answers:

1.  Certain frits will transmit diffuse light, though imperfectly.   
Note that an ideal diffuser will transmit 50% of the light and  
reflect the other 50%.  To transmit more than 50% of the light, you  
will necessarily deviate from a Lambertian (diffuse) distribution.

2.  If you choose a dense enough frit for Lambertian diffusion, then  
a diffuse transmission/reflection model will suffice by definition.   
A reasonable diffuse transmission to expect is around 40% for a good  
quality frit, and about the same for refleciton.

3.  You will run into problems if you don't use the mkillum command  
and manually identify your sources.  See the basic tutorials in  
"Rendering with Radiance" on appropriate application.

-Greg

Hi Andy,

Looks like this one slipped through the cracks during my absence as  
well.  Not too surprising, considering the subject...

Individual source values/images from rtcontrib often do contain a lot  
of noise, which is reduced when you sum several sources together as  
is normally done in a daylight coefficient method, but more  
problematic for sun sources.  (By the way, using the -V+ option  
shouldn't be necessary in this case.)

A funny trick you can try is using multiple identical calculations  
then averaging the result into your output file.  I recommend doing  
this in two steps, so you can recover the run if you have to.  The  
following would take 16 samples at each illuminance point and average  
them together to reduce noise by a factor of 4:

sed -n 'p;p;p;p;p;p;p;p;p;p;p;p;p;p;p;p' pluxmeters_test_office.txt \
	| rtcontrib -V+ -o solar_coefficients16.bin \
	-M sun_modifiers.txt -fad -ab 5 -ad 4096 -lw 1e-8 -I+ -h \
	octrees/scene_with_suns.oct
total -m -id -16 -od solar_coefficients16.bin > solar_coefficients.bin
rm solar_coefficients16.bin

Or, you can put everything in one command if you're feeling brave and  
want to save time & file space:

sed -n 'p;p;p;p;p;p;p;p;p;p;p;p;p;p;p;p' pluxmeters_test_office.txt \
	| rtcontrib -V+ -o '!total -m -id -16 -od > solar_coefficients.bin' \
	-M sun_modifiers.txt -fad -ab 5 -ad 4096 -lw 1e-8 -I+ -h \
	octrees/scene_with_suns.oct

Note that C-shell users will have to add a backslash ('\') before the  
exclamation mark ('!') in the -o option of rtcontrib.

I should probably build this trick straight into rtcontrib, as I've  
used it myself to good effect.

By default, rtcontrib uses Russian roulette to avoid the usual bias  
in Monte Carlo ray-tracing, but it does come at the cost of higher  
noise levels.  I wouldn't know what other parameters to suggest you  
fool with, either.

I can't really help you there, but perhaps someone else has a  
suggestion for the cygwin memory issue.
