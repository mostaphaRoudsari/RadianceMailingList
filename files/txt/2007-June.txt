Hi Greg,
	Thanks for telling me the options "-ps 1 -pj 0 -dt 0 -sj 0", it
indeed increase the accuracy. But the error is still very large. Again
thanks for telling me the command "rtrace". It's really a useful tool to
help me debug my program and it facilitated me to find out there is
something wrong about conversion from PIC file to TIFF file. I failed to
disable the gamma correction!!! After setting the gamma exponent to 1, all
the values are correct. Many many thanks!!!

Message-ID: <000501c7a461$819d6f70$0d01a8c0@nest1>

I am at a loss to resolve why my texture mapping always come up square even
though the 'pic' file may have a aspect ratio other than 1 as in the example
below. 

I am using Radiance Version 3.8

I use the following procedure (Sketchup Pro V6 to 3ds units millimetres):
# 1. Convert the 'jpg' image to uncompressed 'tif'
#	convert -compress none texture.jpg texture.tif
# 2. Create a 'pic' image from the 'tif':
#	ra_tiff -r texture.tif texture.pic
# 3. Determine the average red green blue values of the 'pic' image
#	ximage texture.pic &
#	  Left click and drag a rectangle over a representative area of the
image
#	  Press the letter 'c' to display the values e.g. 0.02,0.45,0.36
# 4. Calculate the appropriate grey values e.g.
#	icalc /usr/local/lib/ray/lib/rayinit.cal
#	  grey(0.02,0.45,0.36)
#	  $1=0.330185114	printed by the icalc program
#	  ^C			Control C to quit the program
# 5. Copy/create the texture material as a plastic or trans material
#	Don't label the material with the final modifier name at this stage
#	The red green blue values should be the value of $1 calculated in
the last step
# 6. Create the colorpict entry to link the image and transformation size.
#	Size is always taken as the smallest dimension of the image is 1
unit.
# 7. Alias the colorpict and the material to the required modifier name

# size 1219 x 2438 This is the size reported with Sketchup for the use of
this image
void plastic Concrete_Form_4x8
0
0
5 0.423402293 0.423402293 0.423402293 0.000000 0.000000

void colorpict image_data_Concrete_Form_4x8
9 red green blue textures/Concrete.pic . frac(U) frac(V) -s 1219
0
0

image_data_Concrete_Form_4x8 alias Concrete Concrete_Form_4x8

ximage Concrete.pic shows the expected 1 to 2 aspect ratio.

getinfo -d Concrete.pic reports -Y 336 +X 168

I have tried varying the last line of colorpict stanza to add in an aspect
ratio e.g 1 0.5 or 1 2, neither made any difference.

Any thoughts would be appreciated.

Hi Terry,

In brief you need to add a multiplier for the aspect ratio (<ar>) of the 
image to one or the other of frac(U) or frac(V).

    void colorpict image_data_Concrete_Form_4x8
    9 red green blue textures/Concrete.pic . frac(U) frac(V)*<ar> -s 1219
    0
    0

For further explanation you can refer to the following two posts, one 
from Giulio Antonutto and the other from me. Both of these deal with 
Lu/Lv coordinate mapping as opposed to UV coordinate mapping. But I 
think that they should still work.

Wow! Your blog is *terrific* Giulio!
I'm sure all (except Greg obviously ;') will find something fresh to tinker
around with on your blog.
Terrific!
Thanks so much!

Thanks, Guilio -- I hadn't seen this.  I especially like the tutorial  
pages; you and Andrew do really nice work.  It's great to have a page  
to point beginners to -- is this linked on the main site at all?

thanks for the feedback :-)
it is an honour! 
It is a choral work from Andrew and me...
We really hope it will help people to start :-)

Subject: [Radiance-general] rtrace output searching for secondary sources
Message-ID: <20070604150110.s6b0qly5s0ows0ws@webmail2.lizzy.com.au>

Hi,

I am using the following rtrace command :

rtrace -dr 1 -lr 1 -dp 0 -ds 0.02 -dj 0 -lw 0 -dc 1 -st 0 -ab 0 -I+  
-h- -w- -otopn model.oct < singlepoint.pts >> output.out

... to output direct rays from a single gridpoint to an omni light  
source in a room of mirrors.

The intention is to find all the locations of the reflection points  
(of the secondary sources) on each wall from the point of view of the  
gridpoint.  I've written a routine which reads in all the rays,  
filters them and outputs the reflection point x y z coordinates.

The gridpoint is simply :

x y z 0 0 1 indicating an upward direction for the rtrace 'receiver'

The problem I have is that rtrace doesn't output the reflection rays  
if the z-coordinate of the light source is within a small distance  
above the z-coordinate of the gridpoint.  i.e. some reflection rays  
are not output if they are near to, and of course above, the height of  
the gridpoint.

I can understand this may be something to do with the cosine of the  
incident angle and that a threshold isn't reached which therefore  
doesn't output the reflection ray, but I have set -st 0, and I've set  
all the other parameters I can think of to their maximum accuracy.

By setting the property of the mirrors to :
void mirror walls


3 100 100 100  <--- i.e. reflect 100 times the incident intensity

this helped a little, but by increasing the 100 100 100 further and  
further still didn't solve the problem.

If there is anyone who has any ideas, without having to set up each  
grid point for all directions (not just 0 0 1)  - as this produces  
multiple outputs for the same reflection points - any suggestions  
would be much appreciated.

Thanks very much,

Tim
