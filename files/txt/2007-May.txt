Greetings,

I've finally made the plunge from running Radiance in Linux on a PC to 
OSX, never thought I'd see the day!  I compiled Radiance using the OSX 
binaries and all seemed well until using the "rad" program with an illum 
source in the "rif" file.  Once mkillum finishes and rpict kicks in I 
get the following rpict error:

rpict: fatal - cannot find data file "illum12.dat"

The odd thing is that the illum12.dat file was created and is in the 
directory.
Thanks ahead for any insight / advice.

Chris Humann

Hi Chris,

This sounds like a RAYPATH issue.  What do you get when you type  
"echo $RAYPATH"?  I'm guessing you don't have '.' in the path for  
some reason.  Either that, or the directory you're in doesn't have  
the right permissions.  (Though I would expect an earlier error in  
that case.)  What do you get when you type "ls -l illum12.dat"?

Hi,

When using ranimate I noticed that after ranimate finished all jobs on 
localhost and other multiprocessor machines in the network (using ssh), 
all memory used by rpict  remains unuseable. The only solution to free 
memory is rebooting the machine(s). Is this a known issue?

It's part of the strategy for memory sharing.  When everything is  
finished, you can cat the persistence file (-P or -PP argument) and  
run "kill PID" where PID is replaced by the process ID from the  
file.  You don't need to reboot, and the process will die on its own  
after 8 hours.  (This is set by the TIMELIM #define in src/rt/ 
persist.c.)

Hi Greg,

Thanks for your quick response. Yes, in my conversion to OSX I'd 
forgotten that I was now working with bash and hence had a space in the 
path statement where it should not have been.  Back to basics 101.  
Thanks again.

Best regards,
Chris

Hello,
I've noticed that the "-spec" option for ra_tiff is not supported in the 
OSX binaries.  As I've been having problems compiling the head to get 
the newest version of "ra_tiff," I was hoping someone might be able to 
email me the program file?  Thanks!

Hi Greg,

Sorry, seems in trying to catch up with work, I'm writing emails in 
haste.  I meant to refer to the falsecolor option for using the original 
color scale.  In the other distributions I've used it was the "-spec" 
option. 

Thanks.

OK, duh.  I should have realized.  Just go to the first "switch"  
statement in the falsecolor script.  (It's a text file, so you can  
edit it.)  Add the following to the list of cases:

         case -spec:
                 set redv='1.6*v-.6'
                 set grnv='if(v-.375,1.6-1.6*v,8/3*v)'
                 set bluv='1-8/3*v'
                 breaksw

You can stick it in anywhere before the "default:" case.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Specular convex reflector and surface normals?
Message-ID: <46481976.50107@gmx.net>

Hi,

one question regarding "rounded" surface normals on specular surfaces. I 
have a dome with a highly specular (consider 99% specular) surface. The 
dome is an obj-mesh, with interpolated vertex normals ("smooth") and 
imported using obj2mesh.

The rounded vertexes render a smooth dome when viewed from below, as 
expected. But as this dome reflects light onto the floor, it is some 
kind of a big convex reflector. I wonder if for light reflected from 
this reflector to the ground, the normal interpolation is applied, too. 
The background for my question are big bright splotches on the floor. I 
also wonder if this geometry is something not really to be modeled in 
classic radiance, as the old questions of convex reflectors and backward 
raytracing might occur. Is this even a case for photon mapping? I have 
never been in modeling a convex reflector, for architecture this is not 
a typical example in our days, so I am curious about what you propose...

CU Lars.

Hi Lars,

If you use the "mirror" material type for the ceiling, it will cast  
appropriate source reflections, but without the surface normal  
interpolation.  Also, it will incur a lot of calculation overhead,  
proportional to the number of triangles in your ceiling.  I don't  
think I'd recommend it for that reason.

Surface normals are interpolated for other parts of the calculation,  
such as the diffuse indirect, which in your case is not so diffuse.   
This is no doubt the source of your splotches, and the photon map  
addition may well take care of the problem.  You could try it with  
the "mirror" type first, just to see how long it takes and what it  
looks like.

No, the geometry is awfully complex, consisting of a number of domes and 
semidomes which are connected by rounded edges (rounded in geometry). 
With todays computers (and my budget) that will not complete in the next 
years ;-)

Sounds like a field of a small application study of radiance and exotic 
model setup ;-) I have really little knowledge about the radiance pmap 
stuff, so it sound even more exciting. I was already thinking about 
putting an illum under the dome to achieve some smoothing, which would 
be more or less faked of course.

Thanks for the reply, I will keep you informed of any results...

Hi,

I am just getting started with Radiance and i am attempting to find a
workflow which allows the rendering of geometry generated within 3D Studio
Max in Radiance. With my limited expertise the only way in which i can see
of doing this is to export to Wavefront object .obj from 3DS and then use
the obj2rad radiance tool.

The problem with this approach is that the .rad file which is generated by
obj2rad does not appear the same as those that i have used before. When i
try to render these .rad files oconv reports that the beginning of each of
the lines begins with an undefined moodifier.

When i used the resultant octree file in rview it reported a fatal error

"./rview: fatal - (pot.oct): truncated octree"

Any help that you might be able to offer would be very welcome.

Many thanks,

Gareth Beale

Hi Gareth,

It sound's like you need to define materials for your geometry. Obj2rad 
will convert the obj format geometry to radiance format geometry. It 
will not convert material definitions. To see what materials need to be 
defined do the following:

    obj2rad -n my_geometry.obj > my_geometry.data

The -n switch will set obj2rad to only output material related names 
that are used by the obj geometry. You should look for the names between 
the following section:

    qualifier Material begin
    ....
    end

You can ignore the other sections. These are the names of the materials 
being used by the geometry. You will need to define them in a radiance 
material file, for example, if you have a material named: glazing, you 
would then need to define a material in radiance with the same name:

    void glass glazing
    0
    0
    3 .7 .7 .7

This file would then be included before the geometry files when

could you post few lines (10/20) of your converted rad file?
and also which is the command you are using to convert?

if you are still in trouble you may try,
3ds2mgf model.3ds
mgf2rad model.mgf > model.rad


or
obj2mesh model.obj > model.mesh
and import your object as a mesh into radiance,

void mesh model
1 model.mesh
0

Hi,

I am just getting started with Radiance and i am attempting to find a
workflow which allows the rendering of geometry generated within 3D
Studio
Max in Radiance. With my limited expertise the only way in which i can
see
of doing this is to export to Wavefront object .obj from 3DS and then
use
the obj2rad radiance tool.

The problem with this approach is that the .rad file which is generated
by
obj2rad does not appear the same as those that i have used before. When
i
try to render these .rad files oconv reports that the beginning of each
of
the lines begins with an undefined moodifier.

When i used the resultant octree file in rview it reported a fatal error

"./rview: fatal - (pot.oct): truncated octree"

Any help that you might be able to offer would be very welcome.

Many thanks,

Gareth Beale

Is it possible that you have been using the 3ds import before, not obj? 
There are 3ds2mgf mgf2rad, which allow import of 3ds files into radiance 
(there is also a combined script around somewhere, search the archives). 
3ds2mgf used to try a material conversion, so you got valid rad-files 
even without editing material definitions.

CU Lars.

Is the photon map addition for the current release of radiance, or will
I have to switch to radzilla in this case?

I found that there is even no pmap for 3.8? The learnix-distribution
mentions that pmap is not supported any more in their radiance set-up
and available only in radzilla (which is in learnix). Seams that I will
have to get radzilla on my Mac (used to be difficult because of QT).

Hi Lars,

Let me know how you make out; I have never gotten QT going on my Mac, 
and the last time I tried radzilla I even got some errors with the CLI 
tools, but I have not tried Carsten's latest code.

I contacted Jan over pmap when I started working on the latest LEARNIX
around September last year. He was very busy at the time (and probably
still is) with his PhD. He was about to talk to their programmer about
some minor changes he liked to see implemented in pmap on top of the
obvious adjustments necessary to move it from Radiance 3.7 to 3.8. Seems
that Jan has just been too busy.

Carsten Bauer was kind enough to tweak the 3.7 pmap so it would compile
with 3.8. I did, however, decide not to ship it with LEARNIX since it was
not officially endorsed by the maintainer. This tough decision was
eased by the fact that one or two of the test routines shipping with pmap
failed.

As regards to Radzilla (radzilla/RADZILLA ???) -- There are three types of
photons in pmap, of which Carsten implements two. Don't ask me what they
are and when you need them. I guess that the third, unimplemented type is
not used very often, otherwise it would probably be there in Radzilla.

Because of LEARNIX, I have been following the progression of RZ very
closely and am pleased to report that it has improved tremendously over
the last 6 months. However, one thing that you always must remember is
that RZ is a complete re-write of Radiance 'classic' in C++. While the
algorithms are obviously the same, RZ has not seen as much bug-testing and
validation as 'Classic' has enjoyed over the years. This is also true for
the pmap plug-in. I am not saying that RZ is buggy, but it might be an
issue. Carten actually considers RZ 'alpha'.

So, to cut a long story short: Unless you go back to R 3.7, there is no
'official' pmap for Radiance. I would personally very much like to see
pmap integrated into the main Radiance tree and available with the same
download, but there are probably issues (license, maintainership, coding
style etc.) that have prevented this from happening. So far, anyhow.

Hi!

I think I will try that besides Radzilla. The problem is that the model 
I want to render has been developed with classic Radiance as target 
engine, and as it becane rather huge, uses all kinds of optimizations 
that fit to classic. I will try to render it in Radzilla, but have not 
been successful so far. So I need the safe fall-back while integrating 
Radzilla step by step into the simulation.

> Carten actually considers RZ 'alpha'.

I think this is one more reason to use it, who else should test it on 
ridicularly blown-up scenes with thousands of light sources ;-) I will 
try this week-end, I just compiled the latest Radzilla (still failed 
with some GUI-stuff on QT/Mac, but I won't need that now anyway).

> I would personally very much like to see pmap integrated into the

Me too... as we come to a point where the photon map is needed, is 
available and validated, it would be not very reasonable to keep people 
away from using it. Maybe something for a Radiance 4.x line?

Hi folks,

rather than tracing rays, we'll be moving hardware for a change:

The radiance-online server will be physically shipped from Freiburg, DE 
to Berkeley, CA at some time this week (starting approximately tomorrow) 
and be re-connected there (provided it arrives intact, doesn't get blown 
up at customs, etc, etc.). Rather than bothering with configuring new 
hardware, it seemed easier just to sent the ****** thing in-toto as a 
start.
However, obviously, there will be a slight technical delay in between. 
Emails sent to the server will be queued at your email provider (and may 
generate a delay warning) and web access will be suprisingly slow during 
the transport phase.

Many thanks to the daylighting group at Fraunhofer ISE for funding this 
transport and thereby easing the transition, to the ISE IT department 
for their provider role since 2001 and to Danny Fuller at LBNL for 
caring for it in the future.

And, most important, to all you guys who compiled questions or assembled 
answers and kept the mailing list active. Keep it up, we'll be back 
online within sight of the Bay- and GoldenGate bridge.

cheers
Peter

Hi Sean,

The book has been out of print for some time.  Greg and Chas were 
successful in reviving it for a while with a print-on-demand deal with 
Booksurge, but that ultimately did not work out either for some reason.  
You could try the local or uni library...

Sean,

If you're interested in borrowing the book for part of the year, 
I can send you my copy. I admit that I don't use it much anymore, 
but I'd still like to hang on to it long-term. Maybe we can 
institute a "RWR-loaner" program. You'd just send it out to the 
next deserving person. Kind of like Bookmooch, but for just this 
one book, and revolving.

How does that sound?

Agreed!  Thanks Peter, this list has been a very valuable resource and I

I agree as well, radiance-online is my top-favorite on every browser and 
the most used reference manual for Radiance since many years. Thanks for 
keeping the server up Peter!

Me too... thanks Peter. While I never had to consult the list asking 
questions, it always was great to be able to help others, so I cannot 
wait for getting a response on "ping www.radiance-online.org" again.

Yes, thank you, Peter. Thanks a lot and a big 'Danke schoen!' for the  
time
and work you put into radiance-online.org. I think the server has been
central in forming the Radiance community and Im glad it will continue
it's role as communication central.

I hope you will find more time now for your photometry business.

Yes,  I'm really sorry for that! I'm still working on my PhD, now 
parallel to projects, which is really difficult.

We had to develop a virtual goniophotometer for pmap in order to 
generate btdfs for special materials. At the first stage, we thought, 
that we had to make some changes to pmap to realize that project. Then, 
it would have been no big deal to make the changes to 3.8. But then it 
came out, that we didn't have to make changes for that. And besides 
this, at that time we got some new (non-radiance related) projects for 
our programmer and therefore the "upgrade" of pmap from 3.7 to 3.8 
unfortunately sloped down in the priority list.

For us it is really difficult to maintain software, when no related (and 
financed) projects are available. Additionally the author of  pmap, 
Roland Schregle, is not at the institute any more, which increases for 
us the needed effort to make changes on the code.
Besides the financial aspects,  our programmer is "loaded" at the moment 
with more than 120% with other projects until fall of the year, so I 
don't see a quick solution for that.
So in the next months, we can  maintain pmap only , if bugs encounter.

I really support your and Lars'  wish to include it in main tree!
The question is, how? We need a volunteer, who is maintaining it.
This is the main issue. License is absolutely no problem.

problems in the second stage (first stage vertexs, second stage 
normals), i've got obj2mesh as reference and using cvtri function to 
create the mesh faces , but an artifact has appeared in the contour line

similar before in radiance docs or list, but now i dont remember where, 
any help?

Hi Ignacio,

Because the normal smoothing doesn't affect the underlying geometry,  
side shading such as shown in your image can exhibit unexpected  
behavior, where the actual shape of the surfaces determines the  
shadows.  Some scanline-based renderers are able to compensate for  
this with specialized algorithms, but it's almost impossible to avoid  
in a ray-tracing system.  You need to create a finer mesh to  
ameliorate the problem, though you'll never be able to eliminate it  
entirely.  The only way to do that is to have the correct geometry to  
begin with -- i.e., by using a sphere in this case.

Jack, it's a export plugin based on max  sdk (software development kit) 
and on radiance meshes, max itself converts any geometry to meshes and 
the plugin .dle is only a bridge to rad meshes, the advantage to 3ds 
export is the no limitation in the number of faces per mesh, the minor 
size in disk of meshes, and uv texture coordinates export. I also prefer 
more open sources of geometry information, but sure you are agree with 
me that we are not going to change our clients habit to work with 
Autocad :-)

A basic plugin doesn't seems to be very difficult, unfortunately a 
urgent visualization project has arrrived to the studio, and i will 
abandone it for some time, when i've something i'll put it here... ...at 
your own risk ;-))

Hi all, I'm doing a project about computer vision. my task is to reconstruct
the surface from a pair of images. the algorithm i am using bases on
helmholtz reciprocity. i generated some "real" images with Radiance to test
my program. but the intensity of pixels seems to be somewhat wrong. I use
plastic material and both specularity and roughness are zero. can someone
tell me whether the intensity of the pixels match the real world value or it
just looks real. Please forgive me for my poor English and the problem is
driving me mad. Any help will be appreciated.

Should match real world, that is what most validation studies tell. 
Still, how do you interpret the pixel values, and how did you define 
material and light sources? Are you sure you did not get confused with 
units somewhere? It is hard to debug a scene we do not know, maybe you 
could describe the setup or even put a sketch to some public ftp or website?

Good luck, and I always thought that man mad(1) should be a redirect to 
man rpic(1) ;-) CU Lars.

I'm going sky-diving for the first time next month, tandem-jumping  
with 4 other researchers right before the Eurographics Symposium on  
Rendering in June.  Since we're doing this as part of a big event, we  
thought we might ask for community donations to sponsor cancer  
research and Mashhuda Glencross set up the following page with  
JustGiving, a leading UK fundraising organization:

	http://www.justgiving.com/AcceleratedRenderers

If you feel like sponsoring us, I'm told it's easy to do.  The  
amounts are all in British pounds, but I think any credit card should  
work the conversion for you.  It's a very good cause, though I'm told  
that jumping out of a plane is one of the quickest cancer cures known...

Many thanks,
-Greg

P.S.  Katja Doerschner and I are just putting in the proposal for the  
next Radiance workshop to be held at the University of Minnesota.  We  
didn't hear back from anyone regarding conflicts for the selected  
dates, the 1st and 2nd October, so let us know right away if you are  
aware of any problems.  Thanks.

Hi ChenGuang,

This is a nice illustration of the problem.  If you rendered these  
with rvu, I wouldn't expect the pixels to match exactly, since the  
actual point rendered is randomly chosen from within each region, and  
using the default parameters of rvu, radiances are only accurate to  
within 15% (see the -pt setting from "rvu -defaults").  This is to  
increase rendering speed.  To avoid sampling discrepancies, you  
should use rpict instead with the following settings:

	rpict -ps 1 -pj 0 -dt 0 -sj 0

Even so, your pixels will only match within 1%, due to round-off  
errors in the pixel encoding itself.  To get better accuracy, you  
will have to use rtrace.

-Greg

I contacted Jan over pmap when I started working on the latest LEARNIX
around September last year. He was very busy at the time (and probably
still is) with his PhD. He was about to talk to their programmer about
some minor changes he liked to see implemented in pmap on top of the
obvious adjustments necessary to move it from Radiance 3.7 to 3.8. Seems
that Jan has just been too busy.

Carsten Bauer was kind enough to tweak the 3.7 pmap so it would compile
with 3.8. I did, however, decide not to ship it with LEARNIX since it was
not officially endorsed by Jan, the maintainer. This tough decision was
eased by the fact that one or two of the test routines shipping with pmap
failed.

As regards to Radzilla (radzilla/RADZILLA ???) -- There are three types of
photons in pmap, of which Carsten implements two. Don't ask me what they
are and when you need them. I guess that the third, unimplemented type is
not used very often, otherwise it would probably be there in Radzilla.

Because of LEARNIX, I have been following the progression of RZ very
closely and am pleased to report that it has improved tremendously over
the last 6 months. However, one thing that you always must remember is
that RZ is a complete re-write of Radiance 'classic' in C++. While the
algorithms are obviously the same, RZ has not seen as much bug-testing and
validation as 'Classic' has enjoyed over the years. This is also true for
the pmap plug-in. I am not saying that RZ is buggy, but it might be an
issue. Carten actually considers RZ 'alpha'.

So, to cut a long story short: Unless you go back to R 3.7, there is no
'official' pmap for Radiance. I would personally very much like to see
pmap integrated into the main Radiance tree and available with the same
download, but there are probably issues (license, maintainership, coding
style etc.) that have prevented this from happening. So far, anyhow.
