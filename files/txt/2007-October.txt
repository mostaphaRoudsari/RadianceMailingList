Hi Zack,

Sorry for the late response, but as I mentioned at the workshop, I  
was out of the country.

Have a look at the following change, made back in 4/93:

	http://www.radiance-online.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/ray/src/cv/ 
source.cal.diff?r1=2.5&r2=2.6

When you say that Type C photometry is measured in the counter- 
clockwise direction, do you mean as seen from below (looking in the  
positive-Z direction)?  If so, then the comment at the top of  
source.cal is correct, but it looks like I messed up on the actual  
definition of phi, which should be:

	src_phi = mod( atan2(-Dy, Dx) / DEGREE, 360 );  { 0-360 }

rather than what it is, now.  I'm really confused, because this is  
effectively what I had before I made the "correction," since I also  
had a -my transform prior to 4/93.  I don't know where my copy of  
LM-63 is, if I even still have it, so if the above line works for  
you, perhaps I should just change source.cal to agree with its  
comment...

Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance in Debian!
Message-ID: <47081092.1070404@bzed.de>

Hi list,

I'm happy to announce that Radiance was accepted in Debian's unstable on
Thursday, it'll be shipped with the next release which is called Lenny.

My thanks go to Gregory J. Ward for replying to all my emails and taking
care of all problems I run into.

At the moment Debian's version is '3R8+20070924.dfsg' - which mainly
means it is the CVS HEAD from 2007-09-24. Unfortunately I had to remove
some pdf files which are in the Radiance distribution without sources,
therefore the .dfsg was added to the version - but I'm sure Gregory and
me will find a way around that, too.

The following packages are shipped in Debian:

* radiance - containing the binaries and manpages
* radiance-doc - containing all other documentation and the examples
* radiance-materials - all material files
* radiance-sse3 - SSE3 optimized versions of the renderers, this package
is only available on i386, the amd64 binaries are automatically
optimized for SSE4 (if I remember right, man gcc tells more ;))

The overview in the package tracing system can be found at [1].

/usr/share/radiace/doc/README.Debian provides additional details, it can
 also be read online at [2]

If the pacakges are not available on your favourite platform yet,
they're probably just not built yet - some buildds seem to lag a bit
behind - [3]. Please try again later :)

I'd be happy about any kind of feedback, especially before Lenny will be
released - which will take some more months for sure, but as soon as it
is released, there's no way to fix minor bugs anymore.

Also - if there's any interest - I'll make sure there will be backports
for Etch available as soon as the package migrates from unstable to testing.

If there's any interest I can also build and provide a Debian live cd
with radiance pre-installed.

For developers are probably the build logs interesting - they're
provided at [4]. Patches I've added to build under Debian are listed at
[5]. Mainly they remove the shipped libtiff in favor for Debian's
libtiff and fix several implicit declarations, which are known to result
in problems on several of Debian's architectures.

Feel free to ask if you have any questions regarding the packages or Debian.


Best regards,

Bernd Zeimetz

Dear all,

I've just been flicking through the presentations of this year's
workshop, and I get the impression you did had a lot of fun. Dancing
and all...

Excuse me if I overlooked it, but I could not find a URL for Yu
Sheng's software. Sounds interesting enough to give it a try. I
particularly liked that LINUX is one of the supported platforms.
That's quite a rarity these days, with all the 'serious' guys (unlike
me) hacking their Radiance-add-ons on Windoze or MacOS...

If you are into statistics, you will have noticed that the sheer
amount of information/knowledge/wisdom delivered at this year's
workshop has reached new heights. The largest presentation tops
120MB!!! I certainly would have struggled with the intake of so much
wisdom at such a short amount of time.

Fulling knowing that I will be stepping on people's toes, I would like
to point out the rogue (un-official) European mirror of workshop
presentations. If you are located in Europe, you might save a few
trees here and there
http://hardware.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/09/27/2157230
by using:
http://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/radiance_workshops/
The speed might not exactly make you dizzy. Our network guys are
rather consistent in messing things up. Depends on the moon, I guess.
I'm afraid it's out outside of my control.

(apologies for cross-postings)

 

Call for software demos - eSim 2008

 

21-22 May 2008

Qu?bec City, Canada

www.esim.ca

 

The bi-annual conference of IBPSA-Canada will be held in Qu?bec City, Canada on May 21 and 22, 2008 (pre-conference workshops May 20, 2008). The event will be hosted by l'?cole d'architecture de l'Universit? Laval, in collaboration with the National Research Council Canada.

 

Software companies and individuals are invited to take part in special software demos sessions during the conference. Much like technical presentations, the software demos sessions will consist of presentations in front of an audience. However, these presentations will not be peer-reviewed and therefore not included in the conference proceedings - although the submission of a technical paper on the software that meets one of the conference themes is encouraged! To be eligible for a presentation during the software demo sessions, the software must be a commercial product or be freely available (on a web site for example). Furthermore, the presenter must be a registered participant. Please note that the scientific committee has the right to limit the number of software tools being presented.

 

The deadline to submit a software is November 27, 2007. To submit your software, just click on the "Software Demo Submission" tab on www.esim.ca <http://www.esim.ca/> 

 

Please also be reminded that the deadline for submitting a paper abstract is October 22 - less than 10 days from now!

 

Conference Chair:

Dr. Denis Bourgeois denis.bourgeois@arc.ulaval.ca 

 

Chair of the Scientific Committee:

Hi,


I am using the dirt.cal function to generate Perlin noise, but I  
would like to make a different noise pattern for each image given the  
same A1 parameter. How do I do this?

Thanks!

Hi Xian,

Actually dirt.cal uses the fractal noise function: fnoise3(x,y,z). The 
Perlin noise function is noise3(x,y,z). You can look in dirt.cal to see 
how the function is used there and in rayinit.cal for library functions 
that are available. There are also additional functions: noise3x(x,y,z), 
noise3y(x,y,z) and noise3z(x,y,z). As I understand from RwR these 
represent the partial derivative of the Perlin noise function at the 
point (see RwR page 253).

Regards,

-Jack de Valpine

Hi Xian,

Jack is correct.  If you want the noise to appear different in  
subsequent images, you must alter your scene description.  Probably  
the easiest is to add some transform to the material, like so:

void brightfunc random_dirt
10 dirt dirt.cal -t ${rand_x} ${rand_y} ${rand_z} -rx ${rand_rx} -ry $ 
{rand_ry}
0
1 0.5

I am assuming an "A1" parameter of 0.5, but use whatever you like.   
The above data may be passed in a file (say "dirt.fmt") to rcalc and  
inserted in your scene like so:

!date +%s | rcalc -e 'seed=$1/1000 - 1192290' \
	-e 'rand_x=3000*rand(seed*1.901+3817)' \
	-e 'rand_y=3000*rand(seed*-1.627-592)' \
	-e 'rand_z=3000*rand(seed*9.67-5824)' \
	-e 'rand_rx=180*rand(seed*2.083+964)' \
	-e 'rand_ry=360*rand(seed*4.813+371)' -o dirt.fmt

random_dirt plastic my_plastic
(etc.)

Since "date +%s" outputs a different number of seconds every time you  
run it, this should give you a new transform unrelated to the last  
one every time -- as long as you don't run them less than a second  
apart.

Why do you want to do this, out of curiosity?

-Greg

Hi Greg,

Well at least I was on the right track as I had recommended something 
similar to Xian (transforms on the noise). (I guess this was offline 
though as I just hit reply.) I could not figure out how to generate a 
random value like this, so I was recommending that something could be 
scripted where random values could be generated with some other 
scripting language. This is much more elegant as it keeps it all 
(relatively) native and in-line to boot.

Hi Bernd,

I've read your post to radiance-general, and am just installing a
Debian-unstable in Qemu to give you some more feedback. This has been
taking forever--my box isn't particularly fast, and is in dire need of
some upgrading. Will get back to you...

I have a few thoughts that I'd like to share with you, irrespective of
the actual install. Please don't take them as rants, and feel free to
completely ignore them if you feel they're out of place. I seem to
have a talent of always striking the wrong string with people...

Before I go on, let me mention that I have not actually packaged debs
myself, but I did roll some Radiance RPMs many years ago, and know how
you must have been suffering from the non-standard build/install of
Radiance. I could never release my RPMs, since this was years before
Radiance went OS, and my explicit request with LBL got turned down.

a) I've been browsing the Debian pages for the best part of an hour
now, but just can't find the relevant page. I might be completely
wrong (this could well have come from the Fedora packaging
guidelines), but something tells me that auxiliary data (such as the
*-materials.deb) should actually go into *-data.deb. This is more
general, e.g. some of the .cal files that you have in there could be
for, let's say some fancy rtrace projection, rather than a parametric
material definition. I believe the general idea behind the *-data is
that it is not required to run the software--many games have extra
characters/cars/worlds in *-data.

b) Have you checked with debian-legal yet whether the Radiance license
is ok for inclusion of the package in Debian proper, rather than
non-free? I've been studying the DFSG and Software License FAQ
(http://people.debian.org/~bap/dfsg-faq.html), and ended up having
lots of scribble (=doubts) on my print-out.

The Radiance license is not OSI approved, this is what the FAQ has
this to say about self-made licenses:

"But it is our strong and heartfelt advice that using a tried-and-true
license is best for almost all purposes. Even large corporations with
dozens of lawyers on staff itching to write their own license have
found this out the hard way, as in the Mozilla license saga, or the
Djvu license story, or the trouble Trolltech had with the Qt license."

The point most relevant (and potentially hindering) seems to be this one:

"# Q: Are clickwrap licenses okay? (Meaning licenses require anyone
receiving the software to click on an I AGREE button indicating ascent
to the terms.)

"A: No, not unless the clickwrap stuff can be removed. Even aside from
freeness, as a practical matter such a clickwrap requirement would be
an unreasonable burden upon our users.

"To be technical, in principle one could put the GPL in a clickwrap
and the license would be perfectly fine. But once you add a
requirement that the software must be distributed via the clickwrap,
or that clickwrap code cannot be removed from the software, your
license becomes non-free. Since clickwraps without such a requirement
are a bit pointless, clickwrap licenses are almost always non-free."

I understand that technically there would be no problem with throwing
up an 'agree/decline' window upon install, but I think this would be
not be solving the problem.

What I do not know is whether this click-wrap is merely an artifact
from the days when Radiance was non-free (in which case we might be
able to lobby LBL as the copyright holder to get it removed), or if it
has been left in there for a purpose.

If you haven't done any legal checkup yet, I'd be more than happy to
offer my help.

c) This, again, is too long ago to remember: There used to be a
Radiance RPM in Turbolinux, and I'm fairly convinced that a Debian
package also existed. One of them actually packaged it into
radiance-nox11 and radiance-x11. The idea was that to use Radiance in
render farm, all the extra X11 requirements would not have to be
installed. I'm not suggesting that you follow this approach, but do
give it a thought.

d) Your communication with Greg happened off-list. I feel that many
Radiance developers (and users, too) would be very interested in
reading though the thread. BTW, this is also the reason why I'm
posting this to radiance-devel, rather than just to you personally. I
strongly believe that the Radiance development process should be as
transparent as possible. Anyhow -- is there any chance of you making
this conversation available to the rest of us (with Greg's permission,
of course)? I am particularly interested in what Greg has to say about
libtiff. It seems you linked to the system one, not the one which
comes with Radiance. Does that mean that the official one can be
trusted now?

e) There's more in the pipeline, but let me get my hands dirty first.

So much for now

Take care

Axel

I've called it -materials now, I doubt that makes a big difference. I
don't know any policy about packages having to use -data. I think most
of the stuff are material definitions in the package, so I think it's fine.
I don't want to split them again, Debian's ftp masters like to start to
grumble if a package builds too many small packages.

If you're facing such questions - the Debian policy is what you want to
read: http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-binary.html#s3.1

radiance is NOT in non-free. It is in Debian/main.
Actually the license is a bit weird, it's similar to the php license
with some name changes, but it's fine for main.
You're probably thinking abut the .dfsg. in the version number - it just
means I had to remove two pdf files which are shipped without source.
Seems the source of one of them is lost, and Greg will ship the other
files's source with 3R9, or they're removed both by him. THen the .dfsg.
is gone, too. Nothing that stops a package from going into main, though.

If I remember right Lars build those packages. I know they exist, but
usually it is faster for me to repackage things from ground of then
trying to understand what other people did and doing things based on that.

I gave it a thought, too, but discarded that for now as the dependency
to x11 only brings a few hundred k of extra libraries. I doubt that's
worth the work. You don;t need to install X completely on Debian...

I doubt it is worth to read trough the whole thread. But if it's ok for
Greg I'll create a summary of the interesting parts of it.

About libtiff: if I remember it right (without reading trough the 30
mails again), the reason why there's one shipped in radiance is that the
libtiff in BSD was broken, or so. Anyway I have no other chance then
using Debian's libtiff, I'd get slapped by the ftp masters if I'd try to
add the source of an old version of libtiff to Debian - it's a waste of
space and another thing you need to patch if there's a security hole in
libtiff.


Cheers,

Bernd

f) If you compile with SPECIAL="ogl", you'll get OpenGL drivers for
the holodeck stuff. This makes it much faster and nicer. There will be
additional device files. Here are mine:

glx1.hdi   ogl.hdi   oglo.hdi   ogls.hdi   oglso.hdi   x11.hdi
glx1h.hdi  oglh.hdi  ogloh.hdi  oglsh.hdi  oglsoh.hdi  x11h.hdi

Downside would be the additional dependency on the Mesa libs.

b) (again). I did not mean to suggest that Radiance is not Free. What
I simply do not know is whether it's Free Enough to be included in
Debian proper. It certainly is free enough for me.

I already pointed out the potential click-wrap problem, which you
simply patched away.

If the click-wrap is there for no reason at all, then a better
solution would be to get it removed up-stream. Since I don't know what
Greg has to say about this, I shall make no further assumptions.
Generally speaking, however, you only need to agree if somebody takes
something away from you (e.g. your right to distribute the software,
like it was in those old days), not if somebody gives you something
for absolutely and unconditionally free.

Another interesting phrase is para 5 of the Radiance Software License:

"5. Products derived from this software may not be called "Radiance",
nor may "Radiance" appear in their name, without prior written
permission of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory."

No problem with me. However, what it would stop me from doing is to
create something like radiance-ng (as in next-generation), or
radiance-nt (as in new technology) or nu-radiance (as in new).

You will be aware that there is syslog and syslog-ng, both GPLd, I
believe, so this kind of naming is not unheard of.

The question is whether this teeny weeny restriction of my freedom to
name a derived package anything-radiance or radiance-anything is
enough for the very strict rules of the DSC to render it non-free.
Probably not, but I thought I'd throw in my 2 Escudos, anyhow.

I trust that you as a seasoned Debian developer with >30 packages
under your belt know all the ins and outs of all sorts licenses and
Social Contracts, so having your assurance that Radiance is
Free-as-in-Debian will make me sleep comfortably at night.

Thanks for your time

broken on linux, at least with the current xorg. It builds, but the
output is distorted. Probably this depends on the graphic hardware,
though. Something to look a bit deeper into.

You can be sure the license is free enough to be included in Debian,
otherwise
- it would have been rejected by the ftp masters. They take such things
_serious_.
- there wouldn't be php in Debian.


> I already pointed out the potential click-wrap problem, which you

The license does not require any kinds of click-wrap, it is the build
system which asks me to accept the license. As the build system is
shipped under that license I'm free to change it (I'm not using it at
all btw, much more easy to do build without the build-system).

Still don;t see the problem here, as the click-wrap is not in the
license but in the build system - but it would probably make people's
life more easy if they wouldn't have to accept the license while using
that build system.

even if you couldn't trust me, you can trust the ftp master who checks
the packages. He reads _every_ file and would simply reject a package if
- debian/copyright (== /usr/share/doc/radiance/copyright) is not
complete or if there're any problems with a license of a single file. Or
because there're two pdfs without source included, which happened to me
- I just missed to look for their source.

Bernd

Hi,

It probably works with the new version.  My problem was getting the newer
version to compile on Macs and FreeBSD was proving problematic, and I didn't
need any of its features so I was lazy and just fell back to one that worked.

Georg Mischler <schorsch@schorsch.com> is responsible for the SCONS build
system, which is there to make compiling under Windows less painful.  I don't
know what its status is, and Schorsch has been pretty difficult to raise these
days.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Definitely the renderers, "rpict," "rtrace," and "rvu" built in src/rt.  After
that, maybe some of the libraries in src/common, especially the cal*.c routines.
 I'd have to think about it after that....

I never wrote man pages for these, as they are specialty programs used by
experts, for the most part.  Some aren't used at all, and probably shouldn't be
compiled (like pcwarp and plot4).  No one else has written man pages for
anything, as far as I know.  You are welcome to give it a go if you have time,
but I don't even have time at the moment to go through them, really.

I don't think the trad code works anymore, and I haven't had time to update it.
 I imagine it would take some effort -- a day or two or three.

(trad is not included in Debian therefore)

Actually, we did a build clean-up a while ago and pulled out all the completely
useless programs.  The plot4 program actually serves a purpose, which I only
remembered after I sent the e-mail.  The pcwarp program is more experimental,
and should probably be pulled.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------


> Do you have any font converters,

As I recall, Paul Haeberli had a really simple polygonal font format, similar to
my own, and it was a snap to convert.  If you have something that already parses
the foreign format, and it's not difficult to add a new output format, the one I
use is quite simple.  It's described in:

If the DEVDIR is not set, and it usually isn't, rholo searches for its device
drivers in subdirectories named dev/ in each of the executable PATH locations.
In other words, installing the drivers in dev/ under the Radiance executable
directory should always work.  I put DEVDIR in there as a precaution for strange
systems that might cause a collision.  It's never happened.

The files you're putting in /usr/lib are executables if that makes any
difference -- did you mean /usr/local/lib?  It seems odd to install things in
the main system directory.  I wouldn't want them there if I were a user
installing a third-party package.

Rholo calls rtrace to do most of the CPU-intensive work, but you can compile it
however you think best.

To test, go to the ray/obj/cabin directory and trun "make nholo."  You might
also alter the nholo target to set -n 2 to make sure multi-processing is working
right, and "-o x11" rather than "-o ogl" to try out the quadtree driver.

I'm sorry but not surprised to hear the OGL driver doesn't work under Linux.
They seem to have a pretty loose idea of this standard.  It works under Mac OS
X, but then, that's where I'm able to test and debug it.

As for -ffast-math, there shouldn't be a problem for Radiance.  It doesn't rely
on exact trig calculations or the like.

The rview program was renamed to rvu just to avoid the conflict with vim.  I put
a soft link in for backwards-compatibility, but you can safely remove it if it
causes problems.

Would be a shame not to include it. Why don't you just give it a try...

I gave it a try and it failed. Gave it another try today and it worked. Probably
it was just too late in the night when I tried it the last time.... Will be
included in the next revision/version of the package. Thanks for the hint.

Hello All,

I have been using trad with my undergraduate students for a number of years.
Last used with the KNOPPIX_V5.1.1CD-2007-01-04-EN.iso (debian) and built
with the makeall script. Worked fine no issues.

Would be sad not to see it in there as it is very valuable in weening the
fancy gui/mouse generation into serious software.

f) If you compile with SPECIAL="ogl", you'll get OpenGL drivers for the
holodeck stuff. This makes it much faster and nicer. There will be
additional device files. Here are mine:

glx1.hdi   ogl.hdi   oglo.hdi   ogls.hdi   oglso.hdi   x11.hdi
glx1h.hdi  oglh.hdi  ogloh.hdi  oglsh.hdi  oglsoh.hdi  x11h.hdi

Downside would be the additional dependency on the Mesa libs.

b) (again). I did not mean to suggest that Radiance is not Free. What I
simply do not know is whether it's Free Enough to be included in Debian
proper. It certainly is free enough for me.

I already pointed out the potential click-wrap problem, which you simply
patched away.

If the click-wrap is there for no reason at all, then a better solution
would be to get it removed up-stream. Since I don't know what Greg has to
say about this, I shall make no further assumptions.
Generally speaking, however, you only need to agree if somebody takes
something away from you (e.g. your right to distribute the software, like it
was in those old days), not if somebody gives you something for absolutely
and unconditionally free.

Another interesting phrase is para 5 of the Radiance Software License:

"5. Products derived from this software may not be called "Radiance", nor
may "Radiance" appear in their name, without prior written permission of
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory."

No problem with me. However, what it would stop me from doing is to create
something like radiance-ng (as in next-generation), or radiance-nt (as in
new technology) or nu-radiance (as in new).

You will be aware that there is syslog and syslog-ng, both GPLd, I believe,
so this kind of naming is not unheard of.

The question is whether this teeny weeny restriction of my freedom to name a
derived package anything-radiance or radiance-anything is enough for the
very strict rules of the DSC to render it non-free.
Probably not, but I thought I'd throw in my 2 Escudos, anyhow.

I trust that you as a seasoned Debian developer with >30 packages under your
belt know all the ins and outs of all sorts licenses and Social Contracts,
so having your assurance that Radiance is Free-as-in-Debian will make me
sleep comfortably at night.

Thanks for your time

Axel

broken on linux, at least with the current xorg. It builds, but the output
is distorted. Probably this depends on the graphic hardware, though.
Something to look a bit deeper into.

You can be sure the license is free enough to be included in Debian,
otherwise
- it would have been rejected by the ftp masters. They take such things
_serious_.
- there wouldn't be php in Debian.


> I already pointed out the potential click-wrap problem, which you

The license does not require any kinds of click-wrap, it is the build system
which asks me to accept the license. As the build system is shipped under
that license I'm free to change it (I'm not using it at all btw, much more
easy to do build without the build-system).

Still don;t see the problem here, as the click-wrap is not in the license
but in the build system - but it would probably make people's life more easy
if they wouldn't have to accept the license while using that build system.

even if you couldn't trust me, you can trust the ftp master who checks the
packages. He reads _every_ file and would simply reject a package if
- debian/copyright (== /usr/share/doc/radiance/copyright) is not complete or
if there're any problems with a license of a single file. Or because
there're two pdfs without source included, which happened to me
- I just missed to look for their source.

It probably works with the new version.  My problem was getting the newer
version to compile on Macs and FreeBSD was proving problematic, and I didn't
need any of its features so I was lazy and just fell back to one that
worked.

Georg Mischler <schorsch@schorsch.com> is responsible for the SCONS build
system, which is there to make compiling under Windows less painful.  I
don't
know what its status is, and Schorsch has been pretty difficult to raise
these
days.

Definitely the renderers, "rpict," "rtrace," and "rvu" built in src/rt.
After
that, maybe some of the libraries in src/common, especially the cal*.c
routines.
 I'd have to think about it after that....

I never wrote man pages for these, as they are specialty programs used by
experts, for the most part.  Some aren't used at all, and probably shouldn't
be
compiled (like pcwarp and plot4).  No one else has written man pages for
anything, as far as I know.  You are welcome to give it a go if you have
time,
but I don't even have time at the moment to go through them, really.

I don't think the trad code works anymore, and I haven't had time to update
it.
 I imagine it would take some effort -- a day or two or three.

(trad is not included in Debian therefore)

Actually, we did a build clean-up a while ago and pulled out all the
completely
useless programs.  The plot4 program actually serves a purpose, which I only
remembered after I sent the e-mail.  The pcwarp program is more
experimental,
and should probably be pulled.

As I recall, Paul Haeberli had a really simple polygonal font format,
similar to
my own, and it was a snap to convert.  If you have something that already
parses
the foreign format, and it's not difficult to add a new output format, the
one I
use is quite simple.  It's described in:
http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/filefmts.pdf

If the DEVDIR is not set, and it usually isn't, rholo searches for its
device
drivers in subdirectories named dev/ in each of the executable PATH
locations.
In other words, installing the drivers in dev/ under the Radiance executable
directory should always work.  I put DEVDIR in there as a precaution for
strange
systems that might cause a collision.  It's never happened.

The files you're putting in /usr/lib are executables if that makes any
difference -- did you mean /usr/local/lib?  It seems odd to install things
in
the main system directory.  I wouldn't want them there if I were a user
installing a third-party package.

Rholo calls rtrace to do most of the CPU-intensive work, but you can compile
it
however you think best.

To test, go to the ray/obj/cabin directory and trun "make nholo."  You might
also alter the nholo target to set -n 2 to make sure multi-processing is
working
right, and "-o x11" rather than "-o ogl" to try out the quadtree driver.

I'm sorry but not surprised to hear the OGL driver doesn't work under Linux.
They seem to have a pretty loose idea of this standard.  It works under Mac
OS
X, but then, that's where I'm able to test and debug it.

As for -ffast-math, there shouldn't be a problem for Radiance.  It doesn't
rely
on exact trig calculations or the like.

The rview program was renamed to rvu just to avoid the conflict with vim.  I
put
a soft link in for backwards-compatibility, but you can safely remove it if
it
causes problems.

Last used with the KNOPPIX_V5.1.1CD-2007-01-04-EN.iso (debian) and built

should be easy to provide a Debian live CD with radiance. I'll look into
that once radiance is migrated to testing, and all bugs/wishes/... are
fixed.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Questionaire on fluorescent lamp
Message-ID: <3acd9e4a0710150415u34182188t8479bf8d78f54e51@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Everybody,

It's my first time to mail to the radiance mailing list.
I'm using Radiance to calculate near field illuminance (in fact radiation)
from bare fluorescent lamps.
Before doing with real mode data, I tested one with a bare fluorescent lamp
and a plan 20 centimeter away from the long and cylindrical lamp. But the
result right under the lamp was strange, that is, the other values were as I
expected but only in the area directly under the lamp the illuminance was
highest at the center and decreased gradiently as went to the end of the
lamp. For example, the illuminance was 5000 lux at the center right under
the lamp, but it decreased to 15 lux at a quarter point of the lamp,
though the two would be almost same.
Maybe I am not understanding properly the lamp description. Can you anyone
explain this to me? Or Radiance is not adequate for near field calculation
with long cylindrical lamp?

Best Regards

Minki Sung

try to have a look for the -ds setting...

 

if this still a problem for your application I'd investigate the use of
'glow' (0 0 4 r g b 0) in conjunction with an indirect calculation (-ab
n, n>0) 

 

to avoid ambient cache problems you may switch to -aa 0 -u  but this
will require over sampling of your grid to remove Montecarlo noise.

 

hope this makes sense,

Hi,

unfortunately the radiance package builds two programs in /usr/bin which
have a name clash with other packages:

- rcalc
- genbox

According to Debian's policy this is not allowed to have two programs
with the same name and different functionality in different packages. If
the package maintainer can't find a solution, the binaries of both
packages have to be renamed.

For rcalc the maintainer of the rcalc package agreed to rename the
binary to grcalc, so this doesn't mean any change for us.

After discussing the issue with the maintainers of the other package
which provides the genbox binary I have agreed to rename genbox in
Debian, as their package (gromacs, a molecular dynamics simulator) is in
Debian since a long time and their genbox is also used in a lot of
scripts which run it on large clusters. Imho agreeing here to rename
genbox is the only right way to go, although this is a bit annoying for
radiance users of course.

My suggestion would be to rename genbox to genrbox, but I'm open for any
other suggestion.
The rename will be documented in /usr/share/doc/{README,NEWS}.Debian and
of course nobody will be stopped to add a symlink on their system which
points form genbox to genrbox - but I can't ship this link with Debian.


Any suggestions and wishes are welcome.

Cheers,

Bernd

"Genbox" is a name in a decades-old language, and I don't see that  
most researchers are going change their scene descriptions to  
accomodate it, let alone revise the docs.  Could it (and the other  
scene generation primitives) perhaps be placed in a separate directory?

Hi Bernd,

I'm very grateful to the folks who are willing to rename rcalc, as  
this would have been a lot of work to change in Radiance.  Even if  
it's not one of the most common commands from a user's perspective,  
it's applied in dozens of scripts, mine and others', which would have  
been very tedious to track down and change.

However, as Randolph says, genbox is also widely used, mostly in  
scene descriptions.  While we cannot easily change the existing docs,  
this didn't stop us from renaming "rview" to "rvu" to avoid the clash  
with one of vi's half-dozen monikers.  As you noticed, I added a  
symbolic link in the executable directory from rview -> rvu as a stop- 
gap until people picked up the new name.  Would it be possible to do  
this with genbox -> genrbox?

Asking that packages not have any name collisions is a laudable but  
not terribly realistic goal.  Surely, there are so many Debian  
packages by now that name collisions must happen left and right.  No?

If we aren't even allowed a symbolic link, one dastardly work-around  
is to add a check for the "genbox" command when parsing scene input,  
substituting "genrbox" and printing a warning of its deprecation.   
Ugly, but it might work.

Hi Mark,

Looks like a really cool talk -- wish I could have been there.  I  
could spend all day watching the gravity simulation.  Did you do this  
one?  Seems like it would take a small gaggle of supercomputers to  
pull it off.

Greg,

The gravitational sim was done on one Athlon XP over the course 
of a day or two. It was only 100k particles, and the error was 
somewhat high: about 1e-2 per time step. I could probably 
recreate it on an NVIDIA 8800 GTX in an hour. The Unix-friendly 
code is here:

http://mark.technolope.org/part-nd/part-nd_v1.4.tar.gz

and more animations are at:

http://mark.technolope.org/part-nd/
http://mark.technolope.org/part3d/

If someone gave me a supercomputer to play with, you all wouldn't 
see me for months.

I'll forward this to the maintainer of rcalc (which is our Debian
Project leader ;))

Unfortunately I can't ship the link (policy doesn't care of it's a link
pointing to something or an actual binary), but everybody is free to add
one. I could even ship a script to add links to /usr/local/bin for
genbox and rview.

That was the first name clash since a longer time I've seen (and shame
on me, I should have checked that before). Radiance ships so many utils
that it is much more prone to such problems than packages shipping only
one tool. I think in general using a common prefix for utils of one type
are very useful and common to avoid such problems, like k*/g* for
kde/gnome tools. Also our tech-ctte is pretty strict if people try to
use too generic names. For example packages like libcommon or libconfig
probably won't be accepted at all in Debian.

Unfortunately I don;t see any other way yet.

Bernd, Greg,

Do these programs have to go in /usr/bin?  Could they go in, say, / 
usr/libexec/radiance instead?  The main time they're run, after all,  
is when oconv invokes them.  Would that work with Debian standards?

/usr/lib/radiance/bin would work fine, too.

Although I can't install the manpage to the proper place then.
Also I'm not sure if it makes sense to have some of the tools in
/usr/bin and others at some other place. Not having them in $PATH is
something I'd call annoying, too.

I'm more in favor of leaving all executable programs somewhere in $PATH,
as this is what a new user of radiance would expect - and I'm sure
radiance will attract more users when it is distributed with Debian,
which also means it'll be distributed with Ubuntu at some day. Working
around the renamed binary is not very hard, in the worst case it means
to create a symbolic link.

Best regards,

Bernd

Hi

I am new to Radiance so I hope that you will be forgiving if my question has an obvious answer or if I am writing to the wrong list.

I would like to use Radiance with my own (measured) sky luminance distribution rather than using gensky to create a standard sky luminance distribution.

I have been looking at various manuals and userguides I have found online but seem unable to find any information relating specifically to this subject. Is it possible to do this? And if so how is it done?

Thanks for your help

You need to use the brightdata format.  How to do it for the  
Krochmann (145 patch) sky scanner is described in Chapter 3 found here:

http://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm/zxcv-thesis/

Should be easy enough to adapt for other patch distributions.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Question regarding the BRTDFunc...
Message-ID: <200710221516.l9MFGDsJ000644@aesl.hanyang.ac.kr>

Dear Dr. Ward.
Hello. My name is Ji-hyun Kim, majoring Architectural Visual Environment at
the Hanyang graduate school in Korea.
I hope this e-mail will not bother your busy time. 

Now, I am analyzing solar specular reflection effect by buildings' coated
glass with the RADIANCE program. 
The purpose is to measure characteristics of coated glass materials which
are considered in real design process and to make a simulation applying the
data. 

In order to figure out the characteristics of ordinary materials, I used
Spectraphotometer to measure reflectance value and input the other data, 
I could not see solar specular reflection effect clearly so I have tried to
use BRTDfunc option to make a simulation of coated glass materials'BRDF
characteristics.

While I was looking for the research materials, I found out that the input
data of BRTDFunc option is various as below.
 
Mod BRTDfunc id
10+ rrefl  grefl  brefl
     rtrns  gtrns  btrns
     rbrtd  gbrtd  bbrtd
     funcfile   transform
0
9+  rfdif  gfdif  bfdif
     rbdif  gbdif  bbdif
     rtdif  gtdif  btdif
     A10.

I roughly understood the definition of input data. I tried to find out what
method I can use to measure it but I could not find the suitable
information. 
So I would like to ask you some questions. 

1. When I simulate materials, which I use in real, on RADIANCE, how I can
measure the input data that is needed in RADIANCE, 
and how I can divert the measured data to BRTDfunc input data such as rrefl,
rfdif, rbdif. rtdif etc. in order to apply it? 

2. Ordinarily BRDF is defined by intensity of the wavelength according to
altitude angle of incident light and azimuth angle and altitude angle of
reflected light and azimuth angle. 
I figured out that the dat file by four values above is needed like IES file
but I could not find the data about applied cases and composition of dat
file. 
Is there any method to use data in dat file form? If there is, I wonder how
I can make dat file form.

If it is possible, I am going to use gonioreflectometer, which we made, to
measure and apply BRDF data in artificial sky-dome.

3. In case of LBNL_glz\blue_refl.rad file in DATABASE of Desktop RADIANCE,
BRTDfunc is defined as below.

void 	glass 	blue_refl_glass	
0 
0 
3	0.206104	0.194473	0.17589


void 	BRTDfunc	blue_refl_front	
10	
	0.188941	0.178277	0.161239	
	0.356133	0.400754	0.340173	
	0 0 0 
	.	
0 
9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	

void 	BRTDfunc	blue_refl_back	
10	
	0.188941	0.178277	0.161239	
	0.084167	0.17056	0.175861	
	0 0 0 
	.	
0 
9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	

I think this case is a bit different. The part of void  BRTDfunc
blue_refl_front, I think blue_refl_glass is suitable instead of void.
I understood that when identifire is void it is defined as a new material so
I wonder what kind of definition is made above. 
Also, when it set up blue_refl glass material, all input data related to
diffuse reflection have 0 values. It means that diffuse is not at all
considered?
In my opinion, when I simulate BRDF effect by coated glass the values
related to diffuse reflection would be important. How about your opinion?

4. While I was studying related materials, I found rayinit.cal file,
glazing.cal file and glaze1.cal file. 
In case of Glazing.cal file, reflectance and transmittance of coated glazing
are measured by using window 4 programs. 
In my opinion, the RADIANCE option we needed is using glazing.cal file and
it depends on clear and bronze-coated glazing. 
When I apply the glazing.cal file on various coated glasses, how can I set
up the variables to simulate?

Could you give me advice about the way of simulation or setting rendering
option of rpict command 
when I simulate glare due to the solar specular reflection?


I am using RADIANCE program personally. I fully understand how to make basic
image but 
I have a trouble with understanding of making and revising cal file and
Function File so it is difficult to use RADIANCE Program entirely. 

I am waiting your advice to make the best use of RADIANCE. 

Sincerely your,
Ji-hyun Kim.

Hi Bernd,

On closer inspection, my thought to check for "genbox" on inline  
commands and print a deprecated warning isn't all that workable,  
since there are so many places in Radiance where inline commands are  
interpreted.  It would require a lot of ugly and temporary code  
changes.  A better solution is to insert a "genbox" shell script that  
prints out the deprecated message before calling "genrbox."  However,  
this still leaves an executable in the Radiance binary directory with  
the "genbox" name conflict, at least temporarily.  Unceremoniously  
getting rid of genbox altogether would break 3/4 of the scene files  
out there.  This is not just a command entered by users -- it's in  
all our scene descriptions, and changing it means changing thousands  
of user files.  Even if it's only a simple substitution, that's a lot  
to ask for everyone to go in and change their data to accommodate a  
molecular modeling system that in all likelihood hasn't yet caused a  
conflict for any of us.

I'm out of ideas.  Anyone else with a brainstorm on this?

-Greg

Yeah, but the same problem have the molecular guys with their scripts...
Also instead of changing scripts I'd add a link, nothing really
complicated imho.

> I'm out of ideas.  Anyone else with a brainstorm on this?

Question: Do the tools search in $RAYPATH for executables, too?

One idea: While installing the package I could ask the user if he'd like
to have compatibility links created and add those links. I'd have to
check if something like that would be allowed by the policy, though.
At least I can warn them.


Cheers,

Bernd

Hi Bernd,

I'm moving this discussion to radiance-dev, since that's where it  
really belongs.  (Feel free to subscribe if you aren't.)

Having compatibility links as an option during installation is fine  
with me if it defaults to "yes" or provides a clear explanation of  
the pitfalls of not installing the links.  I guess we only need a  
link for genbox at this point, though I would like to keep "rview" in  
there as well for consistency with extant documentation.

None of the tools look in the $RAYPATH directories for executables,  
and I don't store any there.

Tom,
if you ar refering to Gerog Mischlers dxf2rad I am afraid you are out of luck. Since the sourcecode is not available and Schorsch has obviously disapered you might want to try a differrent route. But maybe OSX can run Linux ELF binaries? That could be an option. 
Where are your DXF files coming from? We just implemented a converter for certain types of DXF output (EliteCAD) that for instance produces only triangles with color codes. Workes fine for our purpose. 
Feel free to contact me if you need more info.
Regards,
 Erwin

hi Erwin

  i can't make anything useful out of the linux binary for mac osx so  
far as I can see

i'm using Vectorworks

i don't think there can be a route from Vectorworks to a rad file.

i assume the way to go is to make a dxf file of a Vectorworks model

if you have a dxf converter which would work on a mac, that would be  
terrific !

is it a command line utility ?

Hi Tom,

One workflow option, much as I dislike suggesting it, is perhaps to use 
Sketchup as an intermediate. It looks like Vectorworks will save out an 
skp. Sketchup (commercial version) can then save out an obj format file, 
which can be converted with obj2rad. I have very limited experience with 
Sketchup, but in my few experiences, I have found that the models are 
very very hefty. Another alternative is to save out as 3ds and use 
3ds2rad, however there are limitations to this dealing with data sizing 
for the file format.

Hi Tom,

I have a dxf2rad version available that we have developped for in-house 
use.
We use it almost every day on Linux.
It should compile under osx also. Just dowload the files and run
# gcc -o dxfimport dxfimport_so.cpp

"dxfimport" is a c++ command line utility that reads triangle (face) 
primitives from dxf files, and convert these into Radiance polygon 
primitives, using the layernumber of each face as modifier (LAYER001, 
LAYER002 etc.).

The url is:
http://www.toren.com/radiance/dxfimport_so.h
http://www.toren.com/radiance/dxfimport_so.cpp

Comments in the source files are a combination of dutch and english, as 
I said it is an in-house tool - and I am dutch....  :)

Good  luck,

Iebele

Hope that this is not a secret - but there was a version for OS X that 
never had been released. So - if you manage to contact Schorsch...

I'm not sure about the export formats in recent releases of Vectorworks. 
If you can export 3ds, you can import using a variety of tools. If you 
can export IGES, you might get even better geometry when using brlcad to 
convert to e.g. obj than rad.

Good luck.

Lars.

IGES is a Vectorworks export option.

I'm not clear what bricad is.

I don't understand what the two arguments of this gcc app are doing.

I appreciate your making them available but don't understand what's

Am I generating a usable OSX script to be shebanged or put into the

That error makes me think you have gcc installed on your machine, but 
not all of the libraries.  Have you done a full install of Xcode?  Make 
sure that's been done first, then you may also need to run this as root 
(do you know about the sudo command, which runs things as root?).  After 
it's been compiled (yes, gcc is a compiler so it's not making a script 
but an actual executable), you will move the binary to /usr/local/bin 
with all the other Radiance binaries (you would do this with sudo too, 
i.e. "sudo mv dxfimport /usr/local/bin").  sudo will ask you for the 
administrative password, which you likely set up when you set up your 
Mac initially.  Hope this helps (and does not hurt)!

eww, never compile anything as root. Upstream's fancy build stuff may
accidentally rm -rf / just because some variable went missing.

Hi Tom,

I think Rob is right.
If you don't solve it with Rob's suggestion, try these:

http://www.toren.com/radiance/dxfimport_so_tom.h
http://www.toren.com/radiance/dxfimport_so_tom.cpp

Also you should use g++ instead of gcc, sorry for that, like this:

# g++ -o tom dxfimport_so_tom.cpp

And to test it:
# ./tom

Good luck,

Sketchup is no so bad. I have written a Ruby script to export  
Sketchup models
to Radiance and I'm about to finish and release it soon (I keep  
saying that
for 2 weeks now...). Sketchup has some nice features (like n-sided  
polygons
and a total lack of complex geometric primitives) that can be translated
nicely into Radiance. It has not seen much testing (yet) and if Tom  
needs
a solution today I can only offer a work in progress.

Anyway, Sketchup doesn't make the models 'hefty'; it's the users. If you
have a messy model in Sketchup/Vectorworks/Autocad it will end in a  
messy
model in Radiance.

I remember that there is another script around which was presented at  
the
first Radiance Workshop in Fribourgh years ago. That might have seen  
some
further development and be in a more user friendly state.

Other options: does Vectorworks offer a scripting API? A very simple
Radiance exporter should not be hard to do and can probably be derived
from a sample script (access to the 3D faces is all that's required).

You could use Blender and Francesco's or my own export scripts. The
biggest problem is to find a format of the DXF file that Blender can
understand. But that's the problem of all export-import-export tool
chains (and ultimately of the DXF file format).

Finally, I have written a partial DXF to Radiance converter in Python
once. It was written with one particular DXF file in mind and I don't
think I even added support for 3D faces. If you have a small DXF example
I could see if it works and perhaps add bit to support the most basic
files. I stopped playing around with that because I couldn't work out
some problems with transformations. But if Vectorworks exports to a  
plain
3D space it should be fine.

Regards,
Thomas

I'll chime in that strata2rad by Paul Bourke
was built to convert Strata Studio Pro dxf files to Radiance - and it
also works with Infini-D
dxfs - so it may work with yours
I have Mac binary and source - I don't see it on his site anymore

Hi Thomas,

Well that is interesting about Sketchup models. And to clarify, my 
experience has really been in trying to take client built sketchup 
models and get them into something useful. So my experience biased by 
big not very well built/organized models provided by others. I guess the 
thing that I am glad to hear is that like any modeling tool, if well 
used and controlled, you can get something useful out of it. I would 
certainly be interested in trying your translator if and when you feel 
it is ready to share.

Best,

-Jack de Valpine

Yeah, I got two models recently, one built in SketchUp and the other in 
Revit (same project, same model extents), and the Revit one was 
literally unusable in AutoCAD, much less Radiance.

As a very recent licensee of SketchUp Pro, I too would be interested in 
your translator, Thomas!  I'd also like to hear (maybe off-list) your 
thoughts on how to model accurately in SketchUp, since it seems to still 
lack direct coordinate input, UCSs, and the object snaps seem a little 
lean compared to ACAD...

Hey Rob,

Would you be willing to share experience with Revit to Radiance? What 
where the main problems that you encountered?

Oh, just the usual bs with Autodesk's so-called intelligent entities, 
parametric building assemblies and the like, that get replaced with 
"proxy objects" when saved down to early AutoCAD formats.  Things 
disappear, objects behave strangely (such as not being able to be copied 
and pasted into other drawings), etc.  This particular Revit model I was 
talking about was simply too detailed for its own good and was bogging 
down my system.   In general I find that 300MB drawings will do that.

taking too long.

Hey Rob,

Wow 300Mb, I start being highly suspicious at around 25MB for a CAD 
model.  On the other hand, I think this BIM stuff is going to go 
somewhere, so figuring out how to manage the data is going to be an 
issue worth investigating. I suspect it is particularly nasty if you are 
trying get data out for use in Autocad 2000. I wonder if would be any 
more "inter-operable" going from Revit to 2008.

As an aside, I really wish that the folks at Autodesk would provide a 
method for exporting to obj format. Not that this helps with managing 
gigantic 3D data sets, but it would at least provide good workflow from 
Autodesk tools to other applications....

I'd be interested in that script, too--I have a research project in  
mind.  Do keep us up-to-date.

It's perfectly good at relative co-ordinates (4'11.5" along the X- 
axis from that point).

Randolph

Of course, it keeps everything in inches, which is weird, but there  
are exact conversions to SI units.

Hi Jack,

At the risk of sounding like a crusty old man, I've been hearing that 
this is going somewhere for over a decade now.  But I do agree that 
hardware and to a certain extent software is looking more than ever like 
it's ready for this challenge.  I still would argue that the end users 
are not.  Despite there being an AIA layer naming standard for ten 
years, I have yet to get a couple of drawings from a couple of 
architects that use the same "standard". 

And yes, it does seem like the further you go back, version-wise, the 
more problems you have.  The file size issue is related to this; each 
progressive version downgrade caused the file to grow a bit more.  In 
our case, this model was exported to AutoCAD 2008 format by the 
architect, then converted by me to 2004 and 2000 format, just to see the 
differences.

Yeah, I agree.  This is one of the reasons for our office purchasing a 
license of SketchUp Pro, is the export capability.

It should be said that the script works with the free version.
I don't have a licence.

Well, I have to say that I personally don't use Sketchup a lot. But my
colleagues in the office do and just about every computer trained  
architect
out there. I started the script because the export via OBJ wasn't  
successful
with our models (double entities, totally uncontrollable materials  
etc.) and
I wanted something with a bit more control.

I share your opinion that Sketchup is the '6B pen' of CAD tools. And yet
once someone has done all the work to create the model, I think it's not
effective to do it again in another application. Changes are necessary
to get meaningful results in Radiance but these changes can be done in
Sketchup as well. For Radiance (and lighting in general) the model  
doesn't
have to be 100% accurate.

It would be nice if the architects would pay more attention on the  
accuracy
of their models. But it's not their job to provide the consultants with
usable models for their particular simulation tool. It's their job to do
the fuzzy visual things and that's what Sketchup was design for. If  
it would
require more precision and accuracy it would not be as popular as it is.

Everyone has a favourite and if you know how to use your tools I  
don't see
why it shouldn't be possible to create good Radiance models in Sketchup.

I just can't get the hang of it.

Thomas

No and I would suggest that real BIM is completely disruptive, so it 
going to be interesting. And I am trying to consider how this technology 
might be useful for us, not close to any answers at all though.

Yeah, I have never really understood the layering standards (not that I 
ever paid much attention to them). We have always tried to be pretty 
functional in terms of naming conventions (glass-vision, glass-frit, 
int-wall, int-ceil ....), it just make the layers more intelligible at 
least for our needs.

Hmm, well I will be interested to hear more about this. I guess my 
recent experience with the tool make me feel like washing my hands (but 
this has more to do with a big ugly model than anything else)... I still 
have my evaluation going so I should do some experiments on real models.

I think bigger picture though, the real intermediate file format for 
better or worse is obj, the main problem with this in my mind is then 
loosing out on selected Radiance primitives such as spheres, cylinders, 
and polygons of vertices > 4... as well as having more potential issues 
controlling tessellations of geometry that must NOT be tessellated such 
as geometry being used in any illum source location.

IGES provides you with higher level geometry then the DXF-faces could. 
brlcad is an open source cad package, coming with converters (im- and 
export). You can convert IGES to brlcad to OBJ, which should produce 
very clean OBJ files. Than you can enjoy the great OBJ-support in 
Radiance, including smooth surfaces and all the neat stuff...

You can script the whole procedure.

CU Lars.

For what it's worth, 4 out of 5 3D models I get from architects these days seem to be generated in Sketch-Up and a couple of large clients are actually requiring that we generate sketch-up models of their spaces for approval by the end users (prior to construction).  Having a direct sketch-up to radiance translator would be really great.

Hi Mark,

In general, unless a data representation is published and stable, it  
doesn't make much sense to support it in a translator, as the next  
version that comes out will likely break it.  If there is a published  
standard for Sketchup files, or something closely related (a higher- 
level output from Sketchup), that would be interesting to look at.   
Otherwise, you can try lobbying the developers to put a Radiance or  
MGF export option directly into their software, which is much easier  
to write than a translator.

I don't think the format of the Sketchup files (*.skp) is published
or would be useful as a converter basis. Sketchup (Pro and free) also
support the Google Earth file format which I believe is actually the
current everybody's darling Collada - don't remember where I got this
information from, though. Collada is published and documented but not
exactly easy to understand (at least for me).

Sketchup's Ruby API is limited, badly documented and not officially
supported by Google. Nevertheless I believe it will stay and won't
be rewritten completely in the next release because the developers
appear to test new features in Ruby before they get implemented in C
('sketchy physics' is one example). Also I don't think Google has
enough developers working on Sketchup to start a rewrite just for
the fun of annoying the users.

The API is sufficient to quickly come up with non-interactive scripts
to access or manipulate the 3D scene. It takes a while to figure out
how things are supposed to work but there are plenty of examples for
trivial things like a polygon exporter. If you want a nice looking
interface you can use DHTML - but then it gets rather messy.

Well then, back to coding ...

Google has published an extensive SketchUp API; while as far as I  
know the file format has not been published, the API is likely to  
persist, so  user-written export scripts are possible.  I haven't dug  
into it yet--I've actually been thinking about it for a while--, but  
I gather Thomas Bleicher has, and has something "almost" working.

> Hi all,

I know how to model 3D with SKETCHUP ver 5.5 but I prefer to to do it with
ECOTEC 5.5, although it is not so powerful as SKP.

Unless you expect to run SKETCHUP in Linux in the future, ECOTEC ver 5.5 +
RADTOOLS  (Interface to RADIANCE) + RADIANCE 3.7 (compiled for Windows,
thanks F. Anselmo) do the job very well and easily.

ECOTECT in demo version gives you two hours free to work each time you open
the software, RADTOOLS (thanks Marsh) it is not time controlled it is
totally free!

If you need more than 2 hours to model, I think it`s possible break the
model in parts of the building, and then rebuild it in RADIANCE, but usually
it is not necessary.

It is also possible to import 3DS files exported from SKETCHUP, if you fell
comfortable with it.

I think that`s a very good  solution to model a architectonic space and
simulate daylighting in Windows OS domain.


regards,

Vangelis

Best way to get a Revit model into Radiance is to use 3D Studio Max  
or Viz.

When you export a Revit model to DWG, the material information is  
buried in there but not easily accessible to AutoCAD. This is because  
99% of the exports to AutoCAD from Revit are meant for drafting  
background to send off to other people. So it groups things by what  
they are based upon the AIA layer standard by default. While you can  
edit that, you can't make it do a 'by material' export to AutoCAD  
layers. Well, at least not easily.

If you file link the same DWG into Max or Viz, all the materials come  
along, and you get a very usable model. You then in turn export that  
to .OBJ, and then use OBJ2RAD to make it into a Radiance file. I've  
done it several times with good results: http://www.becausewecan.org/ 
node/190

All in all the Revit models themselves tend to be very clean and  
'watertight' so they work pretty well.

Sucks that you have to use Max or Viz as a file converter to get from  
Revit to Radiance. But I beleive that in the near future more file  
export options will be included in Revit, so that might change soon.

As for BIM being disruptive, I agree wholeheartedly. As someone who's  
done a lot with it over the last six years, I see potential there for  
it to change a lot of how our industry works.

Hope this helps,

Until now I only have 7 users/writers in the system :-/

We can do better than this, I think! :-)

I have just added a "Unix installation/compile from source" page.

Hello everybody!

I'm Lucio Boscolo Mezzopan an itlaian student of electrical engeenering, new member of this mailinglist.

I'm italian as I told, so, sorry for my bad english and feel free to correct me if you like.

Now, my first question and a little more presentation.

I'm doing my thesys project to quit with university. 

The projects involves Radiance and it is not yet defined how it will be in the end, but for the moment, my task is to check Radiace precision.

In other words, I have to find out if Radiance simulates well reality. I could it in two ways: building up a model and measuring real behaviour and simulating it and comparing the datas, or look for someone else who did the same.

Can you help me? Do you know about some pubblication having done this already ? It would be better it to be free of charge, but also if I (actually my university) has to pay for it, it could be great!

Many thanks in advance 

Have good time :)

Lucio

Hi Lucio,

I am working with Radiance since 1993 and over the years I have collected quite a few documents that might be of interest to you. If you want I can send you a list or download links (or the actual documents since some of them have disappeard from the net in the meantime).

In 2004/2005 I initiated a research project which was funded by the EU and the Tyrolean government and together with Bartenbach (a lighting designer and developer) and the University of Innsbruck, Department for Mathematics and Informatics we did a benchmark between the Radiance simulation package and conventional methods, i.e. building a 1/10 model of a real/existing room. The goal was to eveluate the strengths and weaknesses of both methods under different aspects. The benchmark included evaluating/comparing both visual and numerical results.

Unfortunatly this publication is only available in German language but I guess it could be translated to English quite easily. On the other hand I can't promise that I would have time to do this myself any time soon.

However, if you decide to go through a comparison process yourself I would advise you to use an existing room/building as a basis. This way you can measure real world data to use as a reference. Then you would build both, a conventional and a computer model and mesure the results again and compare them with your real world data. I hope I am making sense? There a many aspects which will come up (like how for instance you scale your luminaires or certain materials in a 1/10 model) but I dont want to take away all the fun - in the end it's your thesis ;-)

What I dont quite understand is why your university would pay for an existing publication that already covers what you want to do? Or did I misunderstand that part completely?

 Erwin

Hi Lucio,

I would say John Mardaljevic's thesis is the masterwork of Radiance 
validations.  Available by request, see this link for details:

Hi Lucio!

I think it is necessary to give you a hint before you start this. Every simulation tries to approach the reality of a system. That means you must know the system you want to simulate before you can select a simulation technique.

Radiance is a simulation application that was made with architectural / building models in mind. You can simulate lots of effects that are relevant in finding glare, getting the illumination levels (e.g. to decide if lighting is efficient for a given use of a space) etc. On the other hand, Radiance was not developed to e.g. model the effects of reflector or lense systems. It is a question of scale, materials, effects relevent for the application.

So what I want to explain is - it does not make sense to find out "how accurate" Radiance is. If you have a problem to solve (e.g. simulating a given type of facade, or modeling a new material), it will be easy to find out if Radiance is a suiteable tool. And only than, people will be interested in accuracy (qualitive or/and quantitive).

In other words, I am (and I guess others are, too) curious what system (building, solar system, christmas tree) you want to simulate, and what effects are important and determine accuracy for you...

Good luck, CU Lars.

Unfortunately some show stopper bugs were present in this version,
especially for those using it on Windows. I've fixed a few things and
uploaded a new version to the wiki site.

If you plan to use the script on Windows please download the new  
version!

Even if you're not using Windows you should download the update because
it now exports the north orientation of the scene correctly.

Thank you for your answer.

I've checked it out as you mentioned, but I can't solve the problem yet.
The situation is assumed to take place in the distance shorter than
1.5times of cylinderical light source's diameter. I think there may
need to
some technique to model cylindrical light sources.

Actually, I'm modeling UV lamp emitting only ultraviolet wavelength
in small equipments.
So the cylindrical black light source was defined to have only blue
radiation (for an alternative to UV). Of course all the materials have
reflectance values only for blue radiation.
I want to find the UV intensity on some surfaces, and I think Radiance is
well organized to calculate this value, but I'm not sure if
there is anything to consider like that cylindrical light source is not good
in Radiance.
I really appreciate if I get some advices on my case.

Minki, Sung

If this is about Radiance in general buy the book

     'Rendering with Radiance' by Ward/Shakespeare

or see here:

     http://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/learnix/docs/radtutorial_basic.pdf


If this is about my script to export from Sketchup, here's the idea:

The script creates a common file structure of Radiance scene files
where you have at the top level

   - a materials.rad file with all material definitions
   - a <scenename>.rad file with references to the geometry files
   - a <scenename>.rif file as input for 'rad'
   - the 'objects/' directory with the actual geometry
   - the 'skies/' directory with the sky definition
   - the 'views/' directory with one file per exported perspective
   - a bunch of other directories

Because the script is incomplete the first thing you have to do
is to replace all the material definitions in the 'materials.rad'
file with actual physical materials. You can find a number of
materials in the Radiance distribution or on the internet. It's
worth to reduce the number of materials in the model before exporting.

The next thing you may want to do is to add some keywords to the
<scenename>.rif file. There are some standard options which I forgot
to add. You can use the free Radiance Control Panel to view and
change the settings in a GUI:

     http://squ1.com/download?radiancecp

If you want to do actual daylight analysis check also the parameters
of the sky description. In particular the meridian and skytype are
more or less guesswork.

If you have checked all the above, go to the directory of the '.rif'
and '.rad' file. All references in the '.rad' file assume that your
working directory is this directory when you start Radiance apps.

To start an interactive preview with rvu (not available on Windows)
type

     rad -o x11 <scenename>.rif

To render one perspective (as listed in the '.rif' file) type

     rad -v <viewname> <scenename>.rif

To render all pictures type

     rad <scenename>.rif

All these commands will work on Linux/OS X. I have not used Radiance
on Windows yet (as cygwin or mingw) but I think the commands should
behave similarly to the Unix versions.

Once you have rendered the images you can download the Radiance image
viewer from Square1 to view and analyse your images:

     http://squ1.com/download?radianceiv

The viewer that comes as part of Radzilla should also work on Windows.
Everyone else uses ximage.


One feature I have not mentioned yet is the feature to export points
on a working plane for calculation with rtrace. You have to create
a layer called 'numeric' in your SketchUp scene. All the polygons on
this layer will be exported as a grid of points with 0.25m distance.
The files will be exported to the 'numeric/' folder with a filename
based on the group or scene name.

Example:

You have created a room with windows etc. Copy the 'floor' of the room,
move it 0.75m up (Z-axis) and create an offset of 0.4m from the edge.
You have now a plane floating in space. Move this plane to the layer
'numeric' and create a group out of the plane only or the plane and
the room geometry (recommended because you can move or copy the whole
ensemble at once). Give the group a name (say 'room1' and when you
export the scene make sure the 'numeric/' level is visible.

This will create the file 'numeric/room1.fld' with one line for each
point in the form 'x y z 0 0 1'. This format can easily be piped to
rtrace for calculation:

     rtrace -ab 3 -ov <scenename>.oct < numeric/room1.fld > numeric/ 
room1.irr

(provided that there is already a <scenename>.oct). Don't forget to
check/edit the material for your window. It's very likely that your
glass material is not at all transparent.

If you modify this a bit and use '-oodv' as the output format you can
use the 'Plugins/Radiance/numeric input' menu entry to create a 3D  
surface
from the calculated values.
... perhaps. This is highly experimental. Use at your own risk.


Have fun and report errors,
Thomas

Hello All,

Thomas you have made an excellent contribution to the radiance community
with your SketchUP exporter. I assume this script would also work with
the free Google Version of SketchUP as well. That software was of
limited use to radiance modelling as it did not have the 3DS converter
available in the PRO version.

A point here, for the Google SketchUP (free version) users would be for
the user to manually modify the 'sky' file for location and orientation
as that option works differently from the PRO version of SketchUP.

To this effect a couple of extra comments in the 'sky' file for the
novices would be useful.

With regards to accuracy of modelling using SketchUP, simply use the
mouse to indicate direction and then enter the distance with the
keyboard. This allows wonderful unit conversions on the fly during data
entry. For example say your units  are in metres and you want an offset
of 50mm, type 50mm or 2" and SketchUP will do the rest! It even
understands entries such as 2",100mm for a rectangle.

Hi Lucio,

find attached a paper we published last year in JOSA A about RADIANCE's 
accuracy.
If you are interested in the implementation of the spectral rendering 
method, we have another paper in press that describes that method in 
more detail.

cheers,
