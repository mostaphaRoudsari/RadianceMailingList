Hi Dave,

You should apply the skyfunc modifier to the colorpict. Skyfunc is 
produced by gensky.  You can combine everything as follows:

!gensky 4 1 +12.00 -i -a 42.44 -o -76.5 -m 300

skyfunc colorpict sky_map
7       red green blue midday.pic  skymap.cal map_u map_v
0
1	.5

sky_map glow sky_mat
0
0
4  1 1 1 0

sky_mat source sky
0
0
4  0 0 1 180

NOTE that you should probably also add a ground glow as follows:

skyfunc glow ground_glow
0
0
4 1 1 1 0

ground_glow source ground
0
0
4 0 0 -1 180

Hi,

I think these sky images are only for nice image representation, and
I'm not sure that they have correct radiance pixel values.
To obtain a sky with appropriate luminance distribution (generated
with gensky), and beautiful colors and clouds (as on Simon Crone's
images), images should be normalized first with normpat and then used
as Jack explained in previous mail.

On some of Simon's images there is a sun, and when you apply it as a
pattern for a sunny sky made with gensky, you'll obtain a sky with 2
suns :)
So again I suggest you to use this skies only for artistic or
representation use, and not for accurate visualizations.

If I'm wrong, please correct me!

Marija.

Hi

It may be possible to estimate the color temperature from the RGB Radiance channels by:
1) transforming the RGB values into xyz trilinear coordinates
2) using an approximate formula relating xyz to color temperature.
See for instance this paper:
McCamy, Calvin S. (April 1992). "Correlated color temperature as an explicit function of chromaticity coordinates". Color Research & Application 17 (2): 142-144
http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/col.5080170211

Hope this will help you.

Message-ID: <94D15743AD28084CB9A3C763698895CB0177C8@server.Giladi.local>

Hello,

 

After weeks of trying to understand this parallel universe which is
Cygwin and Radiance, I finally reached the stage where I could attempt
to follow the instructions in the introduction to 'Rendering with
Radiance', 2003.

 

And my first attempt produced the following error message:

 

$ rvu -vp 2.25 .375 1 -vd -.25 .125 -.125 -av .5 .5 .5 test.oct

bash: rvu: command not found

 

I am googled-out.

 

I have tried tirelessly to understand the workings of this new language
and, in Newbie-speak, perhaps this is a PATH issue?

 

I compiled Radiance (several times - still got errors) from the latest
radiance tar files, and I am using CygwinX.

 

A bit of background - Before this first attempt I was familiarizing
myself with CygwinX/Radiance. The first issue for me was that many of
the exe files were not in the bin directory, but nicely organized under
src (source?) and several sub-directories eg util. I compared the
directories to the ones that were compiled with Francesco Anselmo's
binaries for Cygwin (yes, I did that too) and the directories are very
different. I am now confused as how to set up the PATH.

 

Second issue was that the rvu.exe file was not installed at all. I did
copy the rvu.exe (into bin) file from Anselmo's Cygwin installation, as
well as the bash_profile file where he sets up the different PATHS (into
Cygwin directory). I did of course change the file to my setup.

 

Many thanks for any help offered - (please)

 

Angela

Agreed. You'd be much better of using Linux or OS X if any of it is  
available to you.
Have you tried the LEARNiX bootable CD before?

Possible.

Simple test: run the command with the full path instead of only the  
command name

$ /cygdrive/ray/bin/rvu -vp 2.25 .375 1 -vd ....

If that works it is a PATH issue and you have to add the directory  
where all your compiled
Radiance programs reside to your $PATH environment variable. In short  
this is a list of
directories in which the bash will search for a command.

You can read something about configuring your environment here:

http://cs.nyu.edu/~yap/prog/cygwin/FAQs.html
Please note that I have no experience with Cygwin myself and that I  
can only give you
generic Unix advice. This should still work in general terms because  
Cygwin is just
creating a Unix like environment under Windows.


Hth,
Thomas

This level of cooperation within the radiance community is very much
appreciated and while the LEANRIX and the CURTIN images overlap as far
as radiance is concerned, they provide different entry paths/journeys
for the new user to embark in learning/experiencing this remarkable
software.

>bash: rvu: command not found

This is indeed a path error. Essentially the shell (bash) was unable to
locate the program (rvu) in any of the folders listed in the path.

Check that the path you believe does indeed point to the appropriate
directories using
echo $PATH

Tips:
1) Be aware of any additional 'spaces' in the folder names. They will
need to be escaped e.g. "Program Folder" is written as "Program\
Folder".
2) Be aware that UNIX (in this case Cygwin and bash are case sensitive)
while Microsoft windows is not.

Personally, I have found that Cygwin is not for the 'newbie' more those
that know UNIX and need to bring some of its power to the Microsoft
windows environment. 'Newbie's' to UNIX are more often better to jump
directly into UNIX/Linux/OSX (command line).

An alternative to installing Linux on your PC/or buying a MAC, is to use
one of the live cd projects available, where everything is pre installed
such as can be found at Axel Jacobs website -
http://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/ In particular Curtin Radiance images
or Axels' Learnix image.

Hello Terrance,

 

Thank you for your feedback.

 

I do have a PATH problem and am now trying to correct the bash profile
file.

 

I did consider the LEARNiX  CD but was put off from what is written on
their site..

If your Windows data partition (you do have a separate one, don't you?)
is formatted as FAT or FAT32, you can mount it and save your files. The
NTFS file system (Window 2000 and XP) is not supported yet.

I also managed to read some chapters of the Curtin PDF you gave a link
to. I couldn't find mention of saving files. 

 

I had to smile to myself while reading the PDF - I am always puzzled by
the defining of electrical lighting as 'artificial'. Why is that? 

 

Well, here is a professional lighting designer's request to please
consider another term for lighting that is not Sunlight/Daylight!

 

Thanks again, regards

 

Angela

Hello Thomas

 

Thank you for your pointing me in the right direction...especially the
/cydrive/ . The PATH  had to include  /cygdrive/c/cygwinX... I did not
imagine that one could get so happy at seeing a red ball! 

Seriously though, I have followed tutorials/FAQs, including the one you
linked for me, which are great in showing one the basics. CygwinX is
really ok now; it just throws in the /cygdrive/ to add to the
I'm-a-confused-Windows-person state of mind. Now, I need to work out all
the various locations of the command files as they are not all in
rad/bin

 

I did consider the LEARNiX CD, especially after reading Axel Jacobs'
tutorials. The issue for me was how to save files on my PC and server.
This is from their site ...

If your Windows data partition (you do have a separate one, don't you?)
is formatted as FAT or FAT32, you can mount it and save your files. The
NTFS file system (Window 2000 and XP) is not supported yet.

I suppose I could buy an external hard disk but then what about backup..


 

Thanks again and regards

Hello Angela,

The Curtin ISO does not use the local hard drive, though it can as
Knoppix 5.1.1 allows reading and writing to NTFS partitions quite
happily.

The method used with our students is to use USB memory devices/hard
drives - they are very cheap, come in a variety of sizes etc., no danger
of endangering the existing installation.
---------

> I had to smile to myself while reading the PDF - I am always puzzled

What terms would you recommend to use for the generic description of
light from the sun and sky dome versus man made (hence artificial or
constructed) light sources such as incandescent, etc.

If you have a file server in you environment, that should be no problem 
at all. On almost any Linux distribution (and I guess this is true for 
the two mentioned) it is easily possible to mount (connect) volumes on 
nfs and cifs servers. That means 90% of what is used out there. It is 
also possible to mount Appleshare, but I am not sure if this is 
supported in the boot cd's.

Anyway, if you are sure that you cygwin radiance does everything you 
want, and that you won't need a tool not available under windows later, 
I think is it fine to go on. I am actually sitting on a windows pc at 
work (I have no influence on that ;-), and still kept more or less my 
linux environment with Openoffice, Scribus, Gimp, Inkscape, even 
Blender, ESP+ and Radiance more or less intact. So switching between OSs 
may be more a question on very specialized tasks (I have no cluster on 
windows and do not care about stability here so much) - I have the same 
environment on my OS X laptop and the ssh cli'able cluster running 
Linux. So I would not worry so much any more about these.

Good luck, Lars.

Angela,

I'd try them using VMware player, you will be able to run radiance/linux
inside a window within Microsoft windows.
Terrance McMinn explained on "Usage Hint" at link:
(http://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/curtin/)

You can save your files like a "regular" application.

regards,

vangelis

Hi Angela,

I have been a lighting designer for (holy cow) twenty years now, if you 
include my theatre lighting as well as my architectural lighting 
experience, and I STILL use the term "artificial" to describe light 
derived from sources other than the sun and sky, though I also use 
"electric lighting" and prefer that. It's still better than "fake 
lighting"!

Very nice page.

On a related note (and related to the colour picker
http://www.luxal.eu/resources/radiance/cp4r.shtml):

I tried to implement a colour conversion from RGB (display) to
RGB (Radiance) for my Sketchup exporter with information I could
find in the archive and on the web. I had some sort of conversion
working but the closest match is achieved by using the RGB values
directly in Radiance (without any of the -> XYZ -> xyY -> etc steps).

So I'm wondering: Do you have to convert the colour triples at
all to get a visual match in Radiance? And if so, has anyone
already written a script for this or can point out a simple
documentation on the process?

Regards,
Thomas

RwR, ch. 5.1.4 Estimating Surface Color (new edition) states that the
Radiance primaries are 'very similar to the primary colors used in
computer RGB monitors, although there is no widely accepted standard.'
Considering the colour variations you get with different monitors, and
even different settings of the same monitor, it's probably not worth
it.

To be honest, I didn't even look into different RGB colour systems.
I was more concerned with
a) improving on the Photoshop colour picker technique (also described
in RwR), which requires:
  a1) converting the 0-255 range to a 0-1 range, and also
  a2) applying a gamma correction
b) creating the material data bases. There are currently well above
20000 entries.
c) coding import filters for other colour notations

While a1), b) and c) are done, I haven't actually had the time to look
at gamma correction yet, although it should be fairly
straight-forward. This is why the swatch may appear rather different
to the preview render, which has a gamma of 2.2

Subject: [Radiance-general] Creating a two material composite material in 2d
Message-ID: <47F8EBEA.1020002@gmx.net>

Hi list,

trying to optimize an existing model, I have a rather basic question.

I have a surface, which is composed of two materials. Imagine something 
like a checkerboard, two materials, just not with squares but irregular 
forms. I have images of that surface, and of course I could simply map a 
foto onto a white surface using colorpict and get something close to real.

Still, as I have not only color but two materials involved, I do not 
like that idea. I want to have different material properties, not only 
color variation.

So far the problem is solved using two cad geometrys, one for each 
material. This is extremely inefficent, it produces tons of polygones 
and problems.

What I need is to take a black white picture, map it onto my surface, 
and have the black be material a and the white be material b in radiance.

Is there a reasonable way to do that in Radiance?

TIA&CU, Lars.

This formula is applied for each ray.  You can read the code in src/ 
rt/raytrace.c if that helps.  Look at the "rayparticipate" function,  
which is called from "raytrace".

Can't you use -otvL with -me 0 0 0 in rtrace?  This will report the  
ray length and value for the entire ray tree.

Only rays that are linked to tree branches that end in glow surfaces  
or light sources will have non-zero values if -av 0 0 0 (the default)  
is specified.  I suspect the problem in your case is that -me 0.2 0.2  
0.2 is so large that ray paths are never short enough to yield a non- 
zero result.

Hi Lars,

The "mixpict" primitive should work for this purpose:

void mixpict mat_map
7 white_mat black_mat grey matmap.pic picture.cal pic_u pic_v
0
0

--------
You have to define the two materials "white_mat" and "black_mat" and  
you'll probably want to change the picture coordinate mapping to suit  
your needs, but you get the idea.

[First time post, I hope this works...]

This small walkthrough by Ian Ashdown might be of some use or interest.
It describes matching a paint chip sample with a color in the monitor's
gamut as well as correcting the gamma. Free registration required to
keep out spambots, as I recall.

Subject: [Radiance-general] mirror and virtual sources
Message-ID: <EB124710ADB8554C930FADF760BB2BE7025DCDF1@n-yexc01.global.arup.com>

I am modeling a daylight redirection system, something like a light
shelf type of geometry.  I have a two part question regarding the
specular component and virtual sources.
 
It's by no means a validated material definition, but I've been testing
with the following material meant to be something like brushed aluminum.
The intention is that the metal gives the best approximation of the
surface characteristics, while the mirror adds the virtual sources of
the specular reflection.
 
void metal aluminum
0
0
5 .7 .7 .7 .5 .01
 
void mirror aluminum_mirror
1 aluminum
0
3 .35 .35 .35

My first question is the value of the mirror material.  I want to
confirm that my value for the mirror of 0.35 is appropriate (0.35 = 0.7
* 0.5).  I've based this on my general estimate of 70% general
reflectance and 50% specular reflectance for the actual material. Or
should the value for the mirror be the full 0.5 to match the full
specular component?
 
The second part of the question is regarding the use of the alternate
material in the calculation.  From an old post I turned up the following
from Greg:
 
> If you are trying to reflect objects in a surface, the "mirror" 
> primitive allows you to specify any alternate material you choose when

> it is not participating in the virtual source calculation.

Does this mean that the alternate material will participate in the
indirect calculation? Or is the alternate material only used to produce
the appearance of the surface in direct view?  Or something else?

Also, is it reasonable that for a rough surface the mirror value should
be toned down a bit to account for roughness that is not part of the
mirror definition?


Any suggestions for appropriate definitions for actual metals found
commonly in the built environment are welcomed.

Thanks,
Chris

Your current value is best, as it corresponds to the amount of  
specular reflection from the alternate material, and the mirror type  
does not scatter light at all.

Yes, the alternate material will be used during the diffuse  
interreflection calculation, with care not to over-count light source  
contributions.

Roughness affects the scattering of light (and therefore the  
sharpness of shadow boundaries) but not the total amount of light  
transferred.  Therefore, it's not a good idea to adjust the mirror  
value in an attempt to consider roughness.

Message-ID: <94D15743AD28084CB9A3C763698895CB0177DF@server.Giladi.local>

Hello Terrance,
 
The Curtin ISO does not use the local hard drive, though it can as
Knoppix 5.1.1 allows reading and writing to NTFS partitions quite
happily.
The method used with our students is to use USB memory devices/hard
drives - they are very cheap, come in a variety of sizes etc., no danger
of endangering the existing installation
 
Thank you for this clarification. I was considering an external hard
drive for Knoppix/Radiance;  
it was a question of not wanting to deal with a further hard drive to
back up the first.
I admit that the severe warnings I read only helped to confound me more.

 
What terms would you recommend to use for the generic description of
light from the sun and sky dome versus man made (hence artificial or
constructed) light sources such as incandescent, etc.
 
I personally prefer the term 'electrical lighting' for that natural
phenomenon that is electricity, 
which happens to be harnessed by man. I use 'natural light' for
daylight/skylight. 
Candle light I use for dinner!
 
Kind regards,
 
Angela Giladi

Hello Rob,

 

I have been a lighting designer for (holy cow) twenty years now, if you 
include my theatre lighting as well as my architectural lighting 
experience, and I STILL use the term "artificial" to describe light 
derived from sources other than the sun and sky, though I also use 
"electric lighting" and prefer that. It's still better than "fake 
lighting"!
 
-        Rob Guglielmetti
 
 

I've just returned from 'Light and Building' in Frankfurt. I conducted a
very unscientific survey amongst my

PLDA colleagues as to which term they preferred...no consensus I'm
afraid. One fellow member did say

that the German term 'kunstlicht' or 'art light', for artificial light,
does perhaps lack any pejorative (for me) connotation. 

It is like saying to a creator of sublime silk flowers for an haute
couture Chanel dress that they make artificial flowers, 

(as in those ghastly plastic things). The comparison is a bit bizarre I
admit. 

 

(Also referring to Terrance McMinn's question) ... it's more than a
question of semantics. 

I believe that we, as lighting designers, help the architect create a
quality lit, built, human environment.

I emphasize the human environment. 

It is quite difficult explaining what 'quality lighting' means; it's
impossible to quantify. 

We have all come across notions that natural light is good, electrical
lighting is bad. Not true.  

The onus is on us to carefully choose the correct words in helping us
convey our design intent;

and the terms we use for describing the different parts of light take on
added meaning.

 

Kind regards,

 

Angela Giladi

Hello to the list, I am a new user of Radiance, analyzing buildings made in
Ecotect. My problem has to do with the installation of fluoroscent lamps in
Ecotect. I know it is not a major concern of this list, but i would really
appreciate any kind of help, because I must finish my diploma thesis soon.
Let me analyze the problem:

I have a building with many offices. Every office has 6 squares on the roof,
with 4 fluoroscent lamps in each square. Drawing in Ecotect I have to enter
a first point and a last point.
This points represents the last and the first of the lamp or something else?


How can a fluoroscent have a cut-off angle or a hot-spot since this lamp
works in 180 angles?

Last but not least: The first and the last point should be on x,y axis
representing the length of the lamp, or on z axis representing the height of
the lamp.

Thank you in advance for you time.

Subject: [Radiance-general] More on Color Temperature
Message-ID: <d5d7d3120804150219j5e67c131k51157d7c318299da@mail.gmail.com>

In regard to the below message, how does one determine RGB values from a
point of choice in Radiance? I cannot use Radiance yet, but I am just
interested in the code, if it is possible. I would just like to use Radiance
to compare how different luminaires render color differently, and how
varying surfaces appear differently under those lighting conditions. So you
can see I am not interested in the RGB values of the light leaving the
source, but rather the RGB values of the surface which we see.

Thanks,
Nick Calcagni

I hope that makes sense...

Hi

It may be possible to estimate the color temperature from the RGB
Radiance channels by:
1) transforming the RGB values into xyz trilinear coordinates

2) using an approximate formula relating xyz to color temperature.
See for instance this paper:
McCamy, Calvin S. (April 1992). "Correlated color temperature as an
explicit function of chromaticity coordinates". Color Research &
Application 17 (2): 142-144

http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/col.5080170211

Hope this will help you.

Hi Nick,

You are better off multiplying the source spectra with the  
reflectance spectra by hand, then converting to the color space of  
your choice.  Radiance does not really do this, and the approximation  
of three primaries (RGB) multiplied between source and surface is not  
very reliable.  See the following paper for more information:

	Ward, Greg, Elena Eydelberg-Vileshin, "Picture Perfect RGB Rendering  
Using Spectral Prefiltering and Sharp Color Primaries," Thirteenth  
Eurographics Workshop on Rendering (2002), P. Debevec and S. Gibson  
(Editors), June 2002.

Best,

Greg,

First, I apologise for starting a "new" topic rather than doing a reply to
your post. I know message board ettiquite but I haven't figured out how to
"reply" yet.

I'm just an undergrad in architectural engineering, and I haven't had any
courses that went into depth about color or light. So I don't quite follow
what you mean by, "multiplying the source spectra with the reflectance" and
"converting to color space". I've looked into it since you've responded and
now know what those terms mean, but not how to work with them. I was
wondering if you could simplify what that entails and what numbers I will
need to obtain or measure and then what calculation I would have to do. Is
there is an example of what you mean?

Thank you,
Nick Calcagni

Hi Nick,

Most mail systems have a "Reply" button that should work just fine.

I don't really have time to take you through basic colorimetrics, so  
I recommend using one of the many online resources available, or  
buying a book.  Have a look at:

	http://www.cis.rit.edu/mcsl/online/cie.php

This should get you started.

	converter
Message-ID: <WorldClient-F200804152228.AA28060027@mook.peutz.nl>

Dear radiance community,

I have been trying to get the su2rad plugin from Thomas Bleicher working on OS X. However, at 
startup it displays these error messages in a UI.messagebox in sketchup 6:
undefined method `file_loaded?' for main:Object
/Users/Casper/Library/Application Support/Google SketchUp 
6/SketchUp/Plugins/location.rb:163

After I hit the 'ok' button the next messagebox appears:
undefined method `file_loaded?' for main:Object
/Users/Casper/Library/Application Support/Google SketchUp 
6/SketchUp/Plugins/su2rad.rb:167

After that I get a load errors overview from sketchup displaying that it won't load these two files 
due to the file_loaded error.

A little disappointed I try to load su2rad through the ruby console (load 'su2rad.rb') and to my 
surprise it returns:
> load 'su2rad.rb'
++ found preferences file '/Users/Casper/Library/Application Support/Google SketchUp 
6/SketchUp/Plugins/su2radlib/config.rb'
++ applied preferences from '/Users/Casper/Library/Application Support/Google SketchUp 
6/SketchUp/Plugins/su2radlib/config.rb'
true

So I try my luck and enter load 'location.rb' and this one also returns "true". In the "plugins" 
menu a Radiance item is added as well as a location-item.

Even though it is working after all (my compliments to Thomas Bleicher), I wonder why I get 
these error messages in the first place. Someone out there who knows?

Regards,
Casper Esmeijer

Hi Casper.

This basically means that the method 'file_loaded?' is not defined
yet when Sketchup loads the file 'location.rb'. This is a bit odd
because that's actually built into Sketchup these days (as far as
I know). How old is your Sketchup installation?

I can give you more advice on debugging this problem but please
let's do this off list. There's also an issue tracker on the
google code project site:

http://code.google.com/p/su2rad/issues/list

Please report as well where you got the su2rad scripts from. The
SVN repository is not much used so I don't bother with any form
of quality check for the HEAD release.

Regards,
Thomas

I have the impression, while actual rendering time is not increasing to 
much with increasing light source counts (should be about linear in most 
scenes?), the start-up time of processes is increasing dramatically. 
What is responsible for that interesting behaviour? In a scene with some 
thousand sources, it takes three hours until rpict writes the first 
pixels (same is true for rtrace) - than it is going on fine. Is there 
anything I could do to speed up this phase of the rendering?

CU Lars.

Hi Lars,

Do you have any redirecting surfaces (mirror or prism materials) in  
your scene?  This could be the expense of precalculating the direct  
reflections.  In this case, setting -dr 0 will eliminate the problem,  
but at the expense of reflected sources.  The alternate is to reduce  
the setting of -dp, though reducing it to 0 will make the overall  
calculation take considerably longer.

If you don't have any mirrors or prisms in your scene, then the most  
likely culprit is the source obstruction routine.  Since there are no  
options controlling this calculation, the only option is to recompile  
the rendering tools setting -DSHADCACHE=0 in your rmake script.   
Again, the overall calculation might end up taking longer, but you  
will avoid the start-up time.

If your scene is not changing from one rendering to the next, I  
recommend using either the -P or -PP option, which will avoid all  
start-up costs from one rendering to the next, regardless of the  
above settings.

Does this help?
-Greg

Hi Greg,

thank you for that whole bunch of information! ;-) I have no redirecting 
surfaces, but I use (mk)illums to bundle groups of light sources for the 
indirect calculation. I do not know if this causes additional start-up 
processing.

The idea to deactivate the obstruction cache is quite promising for my 
case. I have one illuminated room, so all those light sources are not 
hidden by surfaces any way. That means that all that caching is for 
nothing and just wastes the start-up time in this special scenario.

I will try this as soon as the next image is done (I guess tomorrow) and 
report any success.

The idea to use -P is a good one - but I wonder how to do this when 
using ranimate to control the rendering. Maybe you remember, I am that 
crazy guy using ranimate to render stills - which is nice cause I can 
use it to continue after broken processes, distribute processes both on 
smp and on clusters, and all that... ;-) I will have a look at the 
ranimate documentation once again.

CU and thanks, Lars.

Message-ID: <48066BAE.4050302@gmx.net>

Hi,

as (according to Mark's benchmarks) more and more people start to use 
the fast-math switch when compiling using gcc, I want to share my 
experience that this option, while improving performance, may lead to 
the mysterious "zero ray direction in localhit" errors. I have 
experienced those a lot when using this kind of "optimization", which 
led me to many many restarts of interrupted renderings, and solved the 
problem using a new compile with more standard-friendly parameters.

Just a hint... CU Lars.

I am ashamed to admit that I just comment out line 516 in 
raytrace.c to avoid that error.

   //error(CONSISTENCY, "zero ray direction in localhit");

But then, nobody questions the numerical accuracy of my lighting, 
so I feel somewhat free to experiment.

This reminds me of one of my favorite hardware fixes. My laptop DAC
makes a hideous buzzing sound when plugged into PA amps at electronic
music venues. Of course, this is due to a ground-loop, but isolators
don't totally eliminate the buzz.

The solution? Cut the ground plug off my AC adapter.

(Sorry for running off-topic... and thanks for the hint, Lars)

The newer versions of GCC actually do a pretty decent job with just
the -O3 optimisation:
http://www.luxal.eu/resources/radiance/benchmark.shtml

While I have to honestly admit that I don't know the 'perfect' compile
switches for my CPU (I borrowed them from Mark's benchmark page, from
what appeared to be a processor similar to mine), the benchmark shows
that setting too many exotic compiler options might actually decrease
the speed a little.

Hi Lars,

If you are using ranimate, you should be avoiding startup costs  
already as it typically employs the rpict -S option to read views  
from the standard input unless the ANIMATE variable is specified.   
So, you should only have to wait on the first frame.  Is this what is  
happening?

Hi Lars,

Looking at this problem some more, I tried my own scene with 1800  
sources, and the start-up time with the default compile option for  
SHADCACHE (20) took about 11 seconds additional time to get going on  
a 1.5 GHz G4 processor (i.e., not that swift by today's standards).   
If your start-up time is three hours, I would have to have close to 2  
million sources to get into that kind of range, unless your scene is  
somehow strangely different.  Is there anything else special about it?

This reduced the start-up time from several hours to 15 seconds... still 
I have not seen the results of the rendering ;-)

Did you check what happens if you have your 1800 sources in a large scene?

My 1800 sources are in a large scene -- the octree is a few hundred

OK, that is strange. I try to list the more or less special characteristics.

- use of instances
- use of mesh primitives
- colorpict mappings
- lots of lights (about 1850)
- light sources are grouped into spheres, that are processed by mkillum. 
the illum alt material is an invisible trans type

The rpict process takes about 510MB, already being optimized for memory 
using instances as mentioned.

Should I get some debugging tools installed to check which functions use 
up all the time at the beginning of occluder-cached renderings?

CU Lars.

Hi Lars,

I also have quite a few instances in my scene, so I don't think  
that's it.  I don't know why meshes would be any different, unless  
loading all the meshes and colorpicts takes a long time by itself.   
I'm not sure what you mean when you say the light sources are grouped  
into spheres.  Do you have many light sources per each of your 1850  
illum's?  If so, these should be defined with a glow material with a  
restricted radius.  Otherwise, there is no point to using mkillum.   
Can you send me the description of one of your light sources in a  
separate e-mail (off-list)?

Subject: [Radiance-general] Modeling an oil lamp source
Message-ID: <480E5201.3000001@gmx.net>

Hi list,

this is the first time I am using colored light sources, and I am sure 
that I make some mistakes. So for your amusement and in the hope someone 
enjoys to show me the worst of my misunderstandings, I post how I try to 
model a light source, which is to represent an oil lamp.

I estimate a flame with 2cm diameter, 10 lumen,1900 K black body 
temperature.

I derive rgb 1.00 0.23 0.00 from the color temperature. This is only for 
the chromacity, and to be honest I did not do the CIE transformations 
but looked up in a table for 1900K.

I add a line to lamp.tab reading

/oil lamp/	.54 .41 .95

so that I can use lampcolor and reuse my guesses later.

No I run lampcolor, for the lamp type I enter my freshly defined oild 
lamp, I use meters as length unit, to model the flame I use a sphere 
geometry, and I give my estimated 0.01m radius for the flame (resulting 
in a luminaire sphere of 2cm diameter). My guessed total luminous flux 
is 10 lumens, leading to:

Lamp color (RGB) 28.93 8.62 0.0

Does this make sense? Am I totally wrong? I would apply a light modifier 
created with these values to a 1cm radius sphere now.

Thanks, CU, Lars.

Hi Lars,

This looks about right.  The value for blue is zero because it's  
actually outside the Radiance color gamut.  If you don't want to use  
a table next time, the conversion from color temperature to CIE (x,y)  
is provided in src/cal/cal/blackbody.cal.

-Greg

P.S.  I'm still waiting on your scene description to sort out the  
other problem with the long rpict start-up time.

Now I got completely confused. I am modeling my source in feet, but 
scale it later, before rendering, to metres. Now, I get the radiance 
derived from the total luminous flux of a source (10 lm) and its surface 
(from its diameter 0.02m). The result in units of radiance is per /sr 
m2, so if I apply the light modifier to a sphere and scale it, the total 
luminous flux would increase, right? So scaling light sources with xform 
is a stupid mistake? Do I get it right? I scale more or less everything 
in my model, and usually xform cares about everything, such as textures 
and transformations, but I guess in this case it does not work.

Thanks, Lars.

I have used Radiance for a couple of months mainly focusing on calculation daylightfacors. But now I want to analyze the risk for glare and visual discomfort.
 
 I have constructed a model in Radiance in order to analyze these parameters during daytimes in an officebuilding. For this I want to use the script rpict and falsecolor.
 
 This is how i have done build my model:
 
 I have included the following files in my octree file: materials, constructions, windows, furniture, wheater data and surroundings.
 
 I have used gensky to model a clear sky with sun:
 
 Gensky 21 6 12 +s -a 51 -o -10.8 -m -15 > SkyCIESun.rad
 
 Then I have used the following rpict and falsecolor commands:
 
 rpict -i -vf default.vp -x 512 -y 512 kontor.oct > irrad.pic
 rpict -vf default.vp -x 512 -y 512 kontor.oct > rad.pic
 falsecolor -i irrad.pic -p rad.pic -cl -n 10 -l cd/m2 > lum.pic
 
 I am not sure that these inputs are correct because I get  a high contrast in the picture (black room with a white window). Therefore it is hard the separate the objects and tell the different luminances in the picture.
 
 Does any of you have any ideas of what can be wrong and how to model luminances correctly?
 

 Best regards
 
 Per Haugaard

Start to solve that problem step by step. It seams that the picture 
which you want to use as a background for the isolines is not what you 
expected it to be. You should have that annoying high contrast picture 
if you just look at rad.pic : ximage rad.pic

Usually, the output of rpict is filtered before being viewed. Read the 
manpage of pfilt and maybe pcond. Here you could e.g. adjust the 
"exposure", whih defines how the values of your rendering will be mapped 
to the values that your screen can actually display.

Another problem in your case might be that in your scene, the default of 
one ambient bounce will most probably not enough to model the reflected 
indirected light. Did you use a ground plan for your building (you 
mentioned surroundings)? You should try to render with -ab 2 or -ab 3, 
as light reflected from the surrounding surfaces to the ceiling and 
walls, and from there to floor, ceiling, walls, may have a big influence 
of the result.

Forget about falsecolor until you got the previous steps in the process 
running. First you need the background image, before you solved that you 
do not need to worry how to combine it with contour lines. BUT also for 
irrad.pic, you should definitely increase the ambient parameters for the 
scene as you described it.

Good luck, Lars.

There are a few things you can do to improve the falsecolor output. The
accurate output from rpict is another topic, but it seems that you're
mainly interested in displaying your data.
 
 >  falsecolor -i irrad.pic -p rad.pic -cl -n 10 -l cd/m2 > lum.pic 
 
Your command was missing at least one important item, a maximum for the
scale. If your maximum illuminance in the scene that you're interested
in is say 2000 lux you should add that to your falsecolor command.
 
Also if you are using the numerical data from the irrad.pic, the label
should be for illuminance, lux, unless you are converting to something
else.
 
falsecolor -i irrad.pic -p rad.pic -cl -n 10 -l lux -s 2000 > illum.pic
 
A few more items that you can add to make it more legible... Try a
greater number of steps to your scale, maybe up to 20, although this
might be too many for a 512 pixel image. If your image was larger you
could make your scale larger with the -lh and -lw options. Also if you
have a high range and want to see detail at the low end of the scale
while still registering values at the high end you could try a
logarithmic scale, I think a base around the natural log 2.718 usually
shows the range well.
 
falsecolor -i irrad.pic -p rad.pic -cl -n 20 -l lux -s 2000 -log 2.718 >
illum.pic
 
Try a few variations of the scale, log base, and number of divisions
until you get something legible.

An easy way to get the maximum value in the image is to use pextrem, 
like so:  pextrem -o lum.pic

pextrem will print two sets of rgb values to the standard output, the 
max and the min pixel values in the image.

The main problem I see though, is--if I'm inferring the correct usage 
from the image filenames--is you're using an illuminance pic as the 
input to falsecolor but you're expecting to see nits?  And you mention 
that you're interested in computing DFs?  It seems as though you're 
mixing and matching your units here.  It is important to remember that 
falsecolor has no idea what the images represent, you have to supply 
that info and there is no error checking.  So you could easily supply 
falsecolor with an illuminance pic and place a cd/m^2 label, as it 
appears you have done and Chris has pointed out as a problem...

This is great advice.  These images are quite powerful ways to convey a 
lot of scene information in one view, but the onus is on the user to 
make sure the image tells a fair story.  This means dialing in the scale 
logarithmically to present a fair case for contrast, setting the scale 
maximum to fairly include the extrema (or at least identifying the 
extrema with the -e option to falsecolor) and of course making sure 
you're presenting the correct units.

Hi Lars,

Luckily, scaling a light source does not cause problems, since the  
radiance of a surface is the same no matter what ruler you use to  
measure its diameter...

In other words, changing world coordinate units doesn't affect the  
lighting calculation values.

As Lars already pointed out you have to increase the rendering  
parameters. The default for
rpict is to render 0 ambient bounces (reflections). Without an  
explicit '-ab' you will only see
the sky through the window but nothing that is illuminated by it.  
That's why you get a black
and white picture. Try something like '-ab 2' for a test rendering  
and then increase it to 4 or
5 for the final rendering.

You only need a high value of '-ab' for the irridiance picture. The  
second picture is only
used as a backdrop to the contour lines and doesn't have to be  
accurate. Consider also
the use of an ambient cache file ('-af') to reuse the ambient  
information calculated in the first
rpict call. This will speed up the rendering of the second picture,  
even with high ambient
settings.

Once your pictures render to your satisfaction you will have to play  
around with the
scale of your contour lines. From your description I understand that  
your scene contains
both window and room. In this situation you will most likely see no  
lines on the window/sky
(scale too small but correct for the room interior) or no lines on  
the room surfaces (scale
too large for room). A logarithmic scale might help here but the  
people who are looking
at these pictures have to know what it means.

Thomas

Hi Greg,

I had a look at blackbody.cal can you guide us as to how the kelvin parameter is passed to this cal function into a usable rgb value?

Color temperature is very useful stuff for designers (especially retail) but so poorly represented in most renderers. Any help there would be appreciated

Hi Greg!

Thanks for leads. I tried the settings you suggested but problem still 
occured. I continued my search and I found out what was wrong: the -I 
parameter! I used -i and I get as earlier table of zeros plus one 
correct value (8829, this same value I get when I use only -ov). The 
problem is still with distance. For this zero values sometimes distance 
l equals 0 (most of rays) and sometimes it's normal value (from more or 
less 1.0005 to  1.5955). For non-zero value (8829) distance l=0.01).

I also noticed, that when I use -me parameter (the value of -me 0.2 0.2 
0.2 is not so large, I mean for test calculations, not for real media) 
Radiance counts the L(s) value using l=1.156, this is exactly average of 
  distances l for this zero values! This is quite strange to me...

Anyway, this case is solved.

Further contemplations of problem:

I started this discussion, because I want to calculate some formula. 
First I thought, that it will be possible to compute it using results 
get from rtrace (value and distance for single ray) but now I know it's 
much more complicated. In the file with results there are a lot of data 
that are finally casted away (aren't they?), so I think that operations 
on this data is not a good idea.

My new concept is to write(change?) a few additional lines to code of 
"rayparticipate" function. However I don't really understand this code... :(
I can't find where is hide this formula
L(s)=L(0)*exp(-ext*s)    (assume albedo=0)
I would like to add to formula above some value according to expression
L1(s)=L(s)+[L(0)-L(s)]*[1-exp(-ext*s)]
I want "rayparticipate" function to return me this L1(s) value instead 
of L(s). Is this possible? Could you tell me where and what I have to 
add/change in code of this function? (I attach the code below)
I also thought about write new function similar to "rayparticipate" but 
it possibly required more changes (not in raytrace.c but also in a few 
another files).

I will be very thankful for help.
Regards, Marcin

Hi Steve,

The file "blackbody.cal" just defines a couple of functions, cct_x(t)  
and cct_y(t).  You can use these in icalc or rcalc, like so:

% icalc blackbody.cal
cct_x(2200)
$1=0.5056338
cct_y(2200)
$2=0.4152074

% echo 2200 | rcalc -f blackbody.cal -e '$1=cct_x($1);$2=cct_y($1)'
0.5056338       0.4152074

If you want to go from CIE (x,y) to Radiance RGB, use in combination  
with xyz_rgb.cal like so:

% echo 2200 100 | rcalc -f blackbody.cal -f xyz_rgb.cal \
	-e 'xi=cct_x($1);yi=cct_y($1)' -e 'Yi=$2;Xi=Yi*yi/xi;Zi=Yi*(1-xi-yi)/ 
yi' \
	-e '$1=R(Xi,Yi,Zi);$2=G(Xi,Yi,Zi);$3=B(Xi,Yi,Zi)'

In this case, the second input field (100) is the Y value.

I hope this helps.
-Greg

Hello Marcin,

I am struggling a little bit with the language barrier, but I'm going  
to assume you don't wish to continue the previous discussion, and are  
instead focused on modifying rayparticipate to model the formula you  
give below.  I won't ask why you want it, but here are the changes to  
get you there:

extern void
rayparticipate(            /* compute ray medium participation */
     register RAY  *r
)
{
     COLOR    ce, ca;
     double    re, ge, be;
     double    rv, gv, bv;
		/* modified to return: L(s)+[L(0)-L(s)]*[1-exp(-ext*s)] */
		/* not that this equals: L(0)*exp(-ext*s)+[L(0)-L(0)*exp(-ext*s)]* 
[1-exp(-ext*s)] */
		/* which reduces to: L(0)*[1 - exp(-ext*s) + exp(-2*ext*s)] */
     if (intens(r->cext) <= 1./FHUGE)
         return;                /* no medium */
     re = r->rot*colval(r->cext,RED);
     ge = r->rot*colval(r->cext,GRN);
     be = r->rot*colval(r->cext,BLU);
     if (r->crtype & SHADOW) {        /* no scattering for sources */
         re *= 1. - colval(r->albedo,RED);
         ge *= 1. - colval(r->albedo,GRN);
         be *= 1. - colval(r->albedo,BLU);
     }
	rv = 1. - (re<=FTINY ? 1. : re>92. ? 0. : exp(-re)) +
			(re<=FTINY ? 1. : re>46. ? 0. : exp(-2.*re));
	gv = 1. - (ge<=FTINY ? 1. : ge>92. ? 0. : exp(-ge)) +
			(ge<=FTINY ? 1. : ge>46. ? 0. : exp(-2.*ge));
	bv = 1. - (be<=FTINY ? 1. : be>92. ? 0. : exp(-be)) +
			(be<=FTINY ? 1. : be>46. ? 0. : exp(-2.*rebe);
     setcolor(ce, rv, gv, bv);
     multcolor(r->rcol, ce);            /* path extinction */
     if (r->crtype & SHADOW || intens(r->albedo) <= FTINY)
         return;                /* no scattering */
     setcolor(ca,
    	colval(r->albedo,RED)*colval(ambval,RED)*(1.-colval(ce,RED)),
     	colval(r->albedo,GRN)*colval(ambval,GRN)*(1.-colval(ce,GRN)),
     	colval(r->albedo,BLU)*colval(ambval,BLU)*(1.-colval(ce,BLU)));
     addcolor(r->rcol, ca);            /* ambient in scattering */
     srcscatter(r);                /* source in scattering */
}

Hope this is useful.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Installing library to Fedora 8
Message-ID: <830602.37682.qm@web90501.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi, 
   
  I have a problem about installing the Radiance's library to Fedora 8 by running "./makeall library".  When I ran it, the system responded:
   
  bash: ./makeall: /bin/csh: bad interpreter: No such file or directory
   
  I then searched for any csh files and found two files under a folder called 'etc'.  These files are:
   
  etc/csh.login
  etc/csh.cshrc
   
  Are they the files that "makeall" was looking for?   If so, how can I make it work?
   
  Thanks a lot for your help!
   
  Cheers, 
  Kam

No. You found configuration files for the c-shell (that is csh), but 
makeall is searching for the binary, the "program" itself. I guess that 
you are using bash, which is the most common shell on Linux today.

Look for files called csh or tcsh in /bin, /usr/bin. If they do not 
exist, you will have to install a c-shell compatible package, most 
probably tcsh. I am not an ubuntu-user, on my debian box I would do so 
using apt-get install tcsh .

I hope this is of any help, Lars.

The makeall script is a c-shell script (csh). The typical Linux these  
days doesn't even install
the c-shell any more. That's why your system can't find the csh  
executable. Use your packet
manager to install csh (search for 'shell'). If it is already  
installed check if the path is correct.
It could be something else than '/bin/csh' though I doubt it.

Thomas

Hello everyone,

I have got Intel Q6600 Core 2 Quad CPU and realized that I need to get
all my cores working. So I have developed some shell scripts and I can
upload them for you if someone is interested. In fact they are the
multithreaded wrappers to rtrace and rpict.

The benchmarking results I've got is very promising. The CPU load was
about 99.8%!

I am a Fedora 8 user, and one of the small annoyances of F8 is 
that the default installation misses some useful packages. 
Nevertheless, I have been using Fedora since its inception, 
and F8 is the nicest of them all, mostly because package 
management now works right out of the box.

Pull down "Applications"->"Add/Remove Software", type in the root 
password, and then either search for or browse the list to find 
the "csh" or "tcsh" package(s). Install those, and you'll be on 
your way. Also, make sure that you have the gcc program/packages.

Well, I am curious if you really managed to write multithreading 
scripts, or if you are using multiple shared memory processes ;-) 
Anyway, it would be interesting to see them for curiousity. Are you 
aware that rpiece can help you distributing rendering of one single 
picture, and you can (mis)use ranimate to distribute renderings of 
pictures from a view file? These tools already offer a lot, not only 
generic process control (no matter if you are on smp, a cluster or a 
single cpu), but also error recovery.

CU Lars.

Hi Rob,

Perhaps you didn't meant to reply to the whole list, but we haven't  
decided costs just yet.  They are generally modest for speakers, but  
Raphael can tell you more.  In the past, we have invited speakers,  
and if you're in the area anyway, you would be a good candidate.

Best,
-Greg

Subject: [Radiance-general] Upcoming Radiance 3.9 release
Message-ID: <9CD2E727-A066-42A1-AC5D-D07648544B9F@lmi.net>

Hello All,

I am preparing a new Radiance release (3.9), and face the following  
quandary.  Tom Muertens of CSAIL at MIT has been kind enough to  
permit the distribution of his 3-D scanned models, shown here:

	http://people.csail.mit.edu/tmertens/textransfer/data/

I have converted some (not all) of these into Radiance triangle  
meshes, which I made available on radsite and announced by in  
December 2006:

	http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006- 
December/004134.html

The thing is, they take up quite a bit of space (about 41 MBytes),  
and I am debating whether or not to include them in the standard  
"supplemental" materials tarball.  The last tarball was about 14  
MBytes, but with the CSAIL models included, the size goes up to 53  
MBytes.  Since this data is available separately, we could simply  
suggest those who are interested to pick up the other one if they  
want it.  On the other hand, most users just grab stuff and look  
through it later (if ever), in which case having the data when you  
need a nice object to insert into your interior for some flair will  
be a bonus.

So, I'm asking for opinions.  If you feel strongly one way or the  
other, and can state your preference politely so as not to start a  
flame war, please respond.  If no one speaks up, I'll probably just  
end up including the data, since it's less work for me.

Cheers,
-Greg

I have been so appreciative of the almost exponential growth of hard drive space, memory, and cpu horsepower per dollar in what the market presents as entry level computers. I welcome a few megabytes  which increase the sophistication and  accuracy of Radiance.

Yeah, seeing as how any Apple or Microsoft patch these days seems to  
be at least 50MB, I say go for it and add the meshes!
