Ignacio, If you read the IES file in a text editor, you will see the
bottom portion of the file is mostly 0 values, but with several 0.1 and
0.2 mixed in.  This is either erratic values in the photometry, or
demonstration of actual light leaks from the fixture as it was measured.
It does not appear to be a result of any Radiance parameters.

Message-ID: <JVPZGT$9B4E1A3504471C075675C4D4F4C6860E@libero.it>

Good day to everybody!

I need yuor help!

I would like to know if it is possible to do what I'm going to explain and how could I obtain such result. 

So.. what I need is to have in the end an orthogonal view from above a street which shows isolux lines of luminance from a determined poin of view. 

I guess I should tell Radiance for every and each point of the street as seen from above to collect radiance values as if that point was seen from the observer point of view instead than from above, and then to store those data in an .pic image. Then I would have to pass this to falsecolor to compute isolines.. 

but I don't know how I could do it.. even if I'm quite sure it is possible.. !!

Can someone help me?

Hi Lucio,

It is possible to do what you want, but you need to first generate a  
view using rpict at a high resolution with the -z option to specify a  
depth buffer for output.  Then, give the picture and depth buffer to  
pinterp with the desired orthogonal view and resolution for your  
falsecolor isoluminance image.  Pass the output to falsecolor and  
generate your contours.  The actual values will correspond to the  
original rpict view, but the image will be reprojected into your  
orthogonal view.

Hope this helps!

Wonderfull!!! 

So powerfull is Radiance!! :o)

That's really what I wanted ! Thank you very much !!!

Now let's see if I'm able to really do it ! :-P

Just a curiosity. Pinterp just interpolates datas, right? So as much going far from the observer, as loosing detail, isn't it? This is probably the reason why I need high resolution image. 

It is not possible to just calculate the points needed for the last image orthogonal one) from the observer point of view , and save results in an image format? It would probably need just a quite simple script (which calls rtrace many times) and could save much render time (definition is only were needed). Am I right? Or there is something I didn't contemplate?

Hi Lucio,

Yes, it is true that pinterp needs to fill in missing pixel values,  
which is why you need a very high resolution image.  (In fact, it  
would make sense to set the vertical resolution higher than the  
horizontal resolution, with the -pa 0 option to allow non-square  
pixels.)  However, the results should still be valid.

If you are concerned about calculation efficiency, then you could  
write a script as you suggest.  First, you would use vwrays to feed  
rtrace and get it to generate intersection points for all the  
positions on the orthogonal view.  Second, you would apply a script  
to convert these positions to directions from the observer for a  
second rtrace run that would compute your radiance values.  This  
would be output to an image.  I guess it would go something like:

% vwrays -ff -vf ortho.vf -x XRES -y YRES -pa 0 \
	| rtrace -h -ff -op roadway.oct \
	| rcalc -if3 -of -e '$1=OX;$2=OY;$3=OZ;$4=$1-OX;$5=$2-OY;$6=$3-OZ' \
	| rtrace -ffc -x XRES -y YRES roadway.oct \
	| falsecolor -cl -s auto \
	| ra_tiff - roadway_lum.tif

where XRES and YRES are the desired map resolution and OX, OY, and OZ  
are the observer coordinates.  (E.g., add -e 'OX:10.5;OY:-3.9;OZ=2'  
to the rcalc line.)

I hope this makes sense.  It may require some adjustments -- I didn't  
test it out!

Alternative to Greg's proposal:

Render a first image as a parallel projection with view point and  
direction of
the observer. Create a falsecolor image from this rendering. Then use  
the
generated image as a texture to colour your street. The texture  
rotation would be
the view direction of your observer. Render the street from above  
just for the
texture effect (no second falsecolor).

Again the first image should be large to provide more details. The  
second rendering
could be done in any 3D modeller with sufficient control for texture  
mapping (Blender
for example).

Message-ID: <2511ec390802042333u60834e6ka5e531367f99a954@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I am running annual day lighting Simulation using Daysim, with 105 sensors
on a grid plane. after the .dc and .ill files have been calculated . when i
select the work plane sensors under the "start daylighting analysis" window
i get the following error

*"Warning: *No core workplane sensors have been selected. Daysim will
therefore interpret all illuminance sensors as workplane sensors, i.e.
Daysim assumes that the core workplane extends over all illuminance sensors
in your lighting zone. (Note: To select a work plane sensor, go to
ANALYSIS>>'SPECIFY WORKPLANE'.) "

in my case i have selected two sensors , one at 2 meters and the other at a
depth of 6 meters ,among the 105 sensors. and when i hit the start day
lighting analysis, daysim is treating all the sensors as work plane in spite
of specifying them initially . this is   problem is giving me
incorrect blind setting profile. could any one please suggest me an solution
to this.

thank you,

regards,

Thank you Thomas!

I thought too something like that, but it does not fit my needs. 

I would like to generate the isolux via script .

And your technique could also be quite unprecise, 'couse it doesn't actually calculate rays from the observer eye, in a 'radial' way but from a plane placed in the observer position with parallel rays ...

If I'm wrong, please tell it to me! ;-)

Thank you anyway for your suggestion !

now I'll try the suggestions from Greg, and then I'll let you know !

Hi everybody ! 

I've got a problem I'm not sure how to deal with.

I'm using a Disano light to simulate a tunnel lighting. It is a fluorescent light.

I converted it to radiance format from ies format (previously translated from eulumdat format) using ies2rad with no specific value. Then I calculated illuminance on road surface visualizing isolux scheme.

Then I converted the same light with the "-t white" option. And calculated illuminance's isolux as before. 

The two isolux schemes are different, being value for the white case almost 10 % bigger.

Shouldn't them be equal?

I tried simulating same case in dialux and calculux, and they do report  almost same values as the white case. 

What's wrong? Am I missing some knowledge / trick / anything? 

Lucio

Ps : I also discovered some problems both in ies2tab and in eulumcnv. The second, badly converting photometry (some dark circles appear in the lighted scene as missing photometric values), the first badly converting geometry (flipping x and y definitions). But I have to check this things a little more.

Hi Lucio,

The lamp color data also includes depreciation factors, which  
probably account for the 10% difference.  I assume the "white" value  
is larger.

A long-standing bug has been recently pointed out by Zack Rogers  
related to the orientation of full photometric distributions, and has  
been included in the latest HEAD available from radiance-online.org.   
A statement has also been added to clarify the assignment of the  
width (along y) and length (along x) axes.

Hope this helps.

Indeed, the multiplier for incandescent (which I believe white is 
aliased to) is .95, and the multiplier for fluorescent is .85...

These lamp specs can be found in the file "lamp.tab", usually living in 
the /usr/local/lib/ray directory.

Mmm.. I see.. Thank you very much.. but...

what actually is depreciation? 

Should I run the command "ies2rad -m 1.1764706 -t fluorescent lamp.ies" to have right illumination ? If this is right, is there a reason why ies2rad does not do it automatically? 

If it isn't right, are Calculux and Dialux using badly lights ? 15 % illuminance less is really something.. !!

And, there is some documentation about all this stuff ? It would be an interesting chapter for my thesys I guess..


Sorry for the many question and for my ignorance.

I'm sorry Greg but I didn't understand the following:

What are HEADs in radiance-online.org ?
And actually it is not orientation of photometric distribution the thing which is wrong, but just the luminaire shape which is rotated.. (due to ies2tab and not to ies2rad). But I could be wrong...

We're talking about lamp lumen depreciation (LLD) here, i.e. the gradual 
decrease in lamp output over the life of the lamp--which can be 
significant in certain lamps.  This is the reason why you will see two 
columns for lumen output in any respectable lamp manufacturer's catalog, 
for sources where this is an issue. Often called "initial" and "design" 
lumens, the design lumens are adjusted for a particular lamp's lumen 
depreciation over its rated life.  Design lumens will always be lower 
than initial, unless if you're looking at a first edition Philips lamp 
catalog from 2005 (or 2004, can't remember) which, very embarrassingly, 
inverted the labels on the two values!  (I still have my copy somewhere, 
but I doubt it will become a collector's item (except among a bunch of 
lighting geeks.))

Anyway, back to LLDs... The LLD is but one of the elements that comprise 
the overall light loss factor (LLF) that is commonly used in lighting 
calculations to account for these and other losses inherent to a 
lighting design (room surface dirt, ballast factors, etc).  In Radiance, 
this is accounted for with the multiplier (-m) in ies2rad (though you 
can also use it to simulate higher or lower wattage lamps, or dimming, etc).

***Which brings up a good point: if you are using colored lights in 
Radiance by referencing lamp.tab it's not a bad idea to check what 
lamp.tab thinks the LLD is and make sure it jives with your actual lamp, 
AND make sure that factor is REMOVED from the LLF that you are 
(hopefully) using in your multiplier.***

> Should I run the command "ies2rad -m 1.1764706 -t fluorescent lamp.ies" to have right illumination ? If this is right, is there a reason why ies2rad does not do it automatically?

Hopefully the above paragraphs shed light on the answers to these 
questions, which are "no", and "yes", respectively.  =8-)

See above...

The ies2rad man page does explain the lamp color and the lamp.tab 
lookups.  There is more info in lamp.tab itself.  General info about 
light loss factors can be found in any decent lighting design 
calculation text. 

Hope this helps!

Thanks to Rob for his thoughtful response...

Regarding the HEAD release, those who are willing to compile their  
own copy of Radiance (generally implying they are on some flavor of  
Unix) may download the latest changes from www.radiance-online.org by  
following the "Download Radiance" link along the left frame and going  
to "latest version" to grab last night's source tree.  This will  
include whatever changes and bug fixes have been made since the last  
release.

Cheers,
-Greg

Message-ID: <2511ec390802061633j53a3b727g6bd945eb3f955c64@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I am student at Arizona State University , currently i am doing my thesis,
and i am using daysim to generate daylight coefficients. i want to
represent the 145 diffuse daylight coefficients and the 65 direct daylight
coefficients visually on to a hemisphere and represent then with color
index. could any one suggest any method or program that gives such out put.
or is there any Matlab script that i can find which dose this.

also if i have to do the above  using Matlab. my question is what is the
radius or the sky dome and what is the criteria for diving the dome in to
145 segments.

thank you,

Hello Ji-hyun,

I was very embarrassed to find the following message sitting in my  
"InBox," apparently unanswered.  Did anyone else write to you about  
this?  It must have come at a busy moment and was forgotten in my  
pile, so I apologize.  Let me know if you are still struggling with  
this, and I'll compose a proper response.

Basically, you should have a look at the "glaze" script included with  
Radiance.  Jack de Valpine of Visarc requested and sponsored its  
development, and the script is specifically targeted at multi-pane  
window systems.  It generates a BRTDfunc, which you may use as a  
guide in your process.

Again, I am very sorry for the delayed response.

-Greg

Hello Aditya,

How do you wish to visualize this information?  Since I presume you  
don't have a 3-D display in mind, this leaves you with the problem of  
projecting a hemisphere onto a flat image, which is bound to  
introduce distortions.  I am attaching two Radiance .cal files, one  
that goes from a vector direction to a Tregenza sky patch number as  
used by Daysim, and the other which performs the reverse  
translation.  It shouldn't be too difficult to convert these files  
into something Matlab understands.

Best,
-Greg

Thank you very much Greg for explanation about HEAD. 

Luckily I'm linux user, but unluckily for head to be installed, if I read right, compiling is required. 

Compiling gives me much problems .. I tried to solve them (it seemed it was gcc problems) but the only result was that my system became very unstable and finally didn't even boot, so I had to reinstall the system and feel satisfied of binaries.. !

.Hi Lucio,
.
.The lamp color data also includes depreciation factors, which  
.probably account for the 10% difference.  I assume the "white" value  
.is larger.
.
.A long-standing bug has been recently pointed out by Zack Rogers  
.related to the orientation of full photometric distributions, and has  
.been included in the latest HEAD available from radiance-online.org.   
.A statement has also been added to clarify the assignment of the  
.width (along y) and length (along x) axes.
.
.Hope this helps.

Hi Lucio,

Compiling Radiance should not results in general operating system 
instabilities. It has nothing to do with the operation of the OS. I run 
a few different linux distributions, fedora core, ubuntu and caos. If 
you can tell me what compilation problems you ran into and what version 
of linux  then I can try to offer some input.

Thank you very much jack, very kind of you ! 

It wasn't directly radiance breaking my system. 

Im running Ubuntu Gutsy.

At home I don't have problems, but in my laboratory I do. 

According to someone who tried to help me, I was missing some libraries . And it was trying to install those library that I messed up too much with gcc components installing 'till my system broke. 

I later spoke with a friend of mine, who is using Linux since more than me, and he told me that sometimes happen changing compilers version that programs don't run good anymore. My system actually deinstalled X11 and many basilar components. I tried reinstalling them later on to fix the problem, but no way to solve it fastly. In the meanwhile someone elses told me : why don't yuo use binaries? :-P So, I preferred that very fast way ;o) 

Anyway, if you wanna have a look, this is the first error reported.. but MANY MANY other are following.. 

" Making programs...
~/Scrivania/ray/src/common ~/Scrivania/ray/src 
In directory common...
gcc -Dlinux -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -Dfseeko=fseek -L/usr/X11R6/lib -I/usr/include/X11 -DNOSTEREO -O2   -c -o cone.o cone.c

If you patience to read this mail thank you and let me know, else thank you anyway and don't mind.

.Hi Lucio,
.
.Compiling Radiance should not results in general operating system 
.instabilities. It has nothing to do with the operation of the OS. I run 
.a few different linux distributions, fedora core, ubuntu and caos. If 
.you can tell me what compilation problems you ran into and what version 
.of linux  then I can try to offer some input.

I finally tried the isolux plot from a different view as you suggested me, Greg .

Thank you very very very much for your help ! 

it does wark properly and I did not even had to correct formula "wrays.." as it was already correct ! 

I tried aslo the pinterp strategy, but, having my observer a very small angle of view on the street, the requested resolution of the first image would have been far to big.

I figured out that the vwrays method does not work correctly if there are some obstructions between observer and calculated point . As I'm feeding rtrace view view directions.. !

Is there a stratagem to control this in some way? I dont really need it right now, but i could in the future and I'm really interested in trying to build up some solid calculation program.. !

Thank you very much again !

.Hi Lucio,
.
.Yes, it is true that pinterp needs to fill in missing pixel values,  
.which is why you need a very high resolution image.  (In fact, it  
.would make sense to set the vertical resolution higher than the  
.horizontal resolution, with the -pa 0 option to allow non-square  
.pixels.)  However, the results should still be valid.
.
.If you are concerned about calculation efficiency, then you could  
.write a script as you suggest.  First, you would use vwrays to feed  
.rtrace and get it to generate intersection points for all the  
.positions on the orthogonal view.  Second, you would apply a script  
.to convert these positions to directions from the observer for a  
.second rtrace run that would compute your radiance values.  This  
.would be output to an image.  I guess it would go something like:
.
.% vwrays -ff -vf ortho.vf -x XRES -y YRES -pa 0 \
.	| rtrace -h -ff -op roadway.oct \
.	| rcalc -if3 -of -e '$1=OX;$2=OY;$3=OZ;$4=$1-OX;$5=$2-OY;$6=$3-OZ' \
.	| rtrace -ffc -x XRES -y YRES roadway.oct \
.	| falsecolor -cl -s auto \
.	| ra_tiff - roadway_lum.tif
.
.where XRES and YRES are the desired map resolution and OX, OY, and OZ  
.are the observer coordinates.  (E.g., add -e 'OX:10.5;OY:-3.9;OZ=2'  
.to the rcalc line.)
.
.I hope this makes sense.  It may require some adjustments -- I didn't  
.test it out!

Hey, it looks like I'm quite monopolizing this mailing list.. I'm sorry.. !! 

Some time ago, if I didn't just dream it, I run into some explanation on how to monitor rpict progress status. If I remember well, it was achieved with a light kill message to rpict process. In fact when killing it, it returns the rpict progress. It was a way to achieve same information without actually killing it. I thought I found this information in Axel Jacobs' tutorials, but I'm not able to find it any more.

Can someone help me ?

Lucio, If you add "-t [time in seconds]" to your rpict command line it
will periodically report the progress as the calculation runs.  The same
result can be had by adding the line "REPORT= [time in minutes]" to your
rif file.  Alternatively, if you prefer not to clutter your terminal,
you can pause the process "<ctrl-z>" and bring it back to the foreground
"fg <enter>" and it should report the progress once.

Chris is correct.  You can also send rpict the "continue" signal,  
which is the same as bringing it into the foreground without actually  
doing so.  "kill -CONT pid" should work.

Hi Lucio,

I'm glad that the basic idea works.  The command I sent you does  
literally what you asked, which is to show the luminance in the  
direction of the desired point.  As you noticed, the ray does not  
necessarily get there.  To ensure that it does, you could simply  
start the ray closer to the target point by replacing the rcalc  
command with:

	rcalc -if3 -of -e '$1=$1-nrm*Dx;$2=$2-nrm*Dy;$3=$3-nrm*Dz;$4=Dx; 
$5=Dy;$6=Dz' \
			-e 'Dx=$1-OX;Dy=$2-OY;Dz=$3-OZ;nrm=0.001/sqrt(Dx*Dx+Dy*Dy+Dz*Dz)'

What this does is start each ray a short distance (0.001 in world  
units) from the target point, ensuring that no intervening geometry  
obstructs the view.

I hope this helps.

Wow Greg, that's amazing !

That solution is simple and powerfull at the same time. And Indeed it helped me much in learning how to behave with Radiance's programs. 

THANK YOU 

But let me annoy you a little further. Going on thinking about this problem, I realized that what I really need is something different. I don't actually need ray to be traced from close to the point, 'couse this point aren't actually seen from the observer.. Neither I need ,as it was before, to have wrong informations. Then probably the best option would be to mark the 'wrong' points to understand them are not seen from the observer. A good way could probably be to paint them with an unreal color (or luminance level if postprocessed by falsecolor).

The method could be to check if ray intersection points with surfaces are different from the ones requested, and, in that case, to paint that area with given values. This could probably be achieved also building up some kind of mask image to combine later with pcomb ... ?

Well, I'm sure it is possible, and it is probably simpler than I figure it out, but I have no idea on how to achieve it. 

Well, I'n neither in a hurge now of building such system, so don't worry if you cannot answer.

Hey Rob !!!

I still haven't given thanks to you for your very detailed informations about lumen depreciation and so on.. !! 

THANK YOU !!!!

It is really a gift to have people like you willing to help and doing it so much and so exhaustively ! My thesys (and my radiance learning curve) would require much more time (but really much more) if I wouldn't have your help !!

Guess I should find some similar kind of community to improve my english as well !! :-P

.We're talking about lamp lumen depreciation (LLD) here, i.e. the gradual 
.decrease in lamp output over the life of the lamp--which can be 
.significant in certain lamps.  This is the reason why you will see two 
.columns for lumen output in any respectable lamp manufacturer's catalog, 
.for sources where this is an issue. Often called "initial" and "design" 
.lumens, the design lumens are adjusted for a particular lamp's lumen 
.depreciation over its rated life.  Design lumens will always be lower 
.than initial, unless if you're looking at a first edition Philips lamp 
.catalog from 2005 (or 2004, can't remember) which, very embarrassingly, 
.inverted the labels on the two values!  (I still have my copy somewhere, 
.but I doubt it will become a collector's item (except among a bunch of 
.lighting geeks.))
.
.Anyway, back to LLDs... The LLD is but one of the elements that comprise 
.the overall light loss factor (LLF) that is commonly used in lighting 
.calculations to account for these and other losses inherent to a 
.lighting design (room surface dirt, ballast factors, etc).  In Radiance, 
.this is accounted for with the multiplier (-m) in ies2rad (though you 
.can also use it to simulate higher or lower wattage lamps, or dimming, etc).
.
.***Which brings up a good point: if you are using colored lights in 
.Radiance by referencing lamp.tab it's not a bad idea to check what 
.lamp.tab thinks the LLD is and make sure it jives with your actual lamp, 
.AND make sure that factor is REMOVED from the LLF that you are 
.(hopefully) using in your multiplier.***
.

.The ies2rad man page does explain the lamp color and the lamp.tab

Hi Lucio,

It's probably easiest just to make the invisible areas zero in the  
falsecolor image, which you could do like so:

% vwrays -ff -vf ortho.vf -x XRES -y YRES -pa 0 \
	| rtrace -h -ff -op roadway.oct > roadpts.flt
% rcalc -if3 -of -e '$1=OX;$2=OY;$3=OZ;$4=$1-OX;$5=$2-OY;$6=$3-OZ'  
roadpts.flt \
	| rtrace -ff -opv -x XRES -y YRES roadway.oct \
	| rlam -if3 roadpts.flt -if6 - \
	| rcalc -if9 -of -e 's(x):x*x;OK=0.2-s($1-$4)-s($2-$5)-s($3-$6)' \
		-e '$1=if(OK,$7,0);$2=if(OK,$8,0);$3=if(OK,$9,0)' \
	| falsecolor -cl -s auto \
	| ra_tiff - roadway_lum.tif
% rm roadpts.flt

The usual caveats apply, as I haven't tried this.  If your world  
units are cm or something smaller, the 0.2 value might have to be  
increased for reliable behavior.

make it run faster, but aren't really necessary.

GREAT !! Simply GREAT !!!!

Thank you very much Greg. 

I was missing some knowledge to build up something like that and my printed manpages were not up-to-date as the online ones ..

Your help opens me new horizons ! Thank you very much !

And many thanks also to all the people who helped me with the rpict progress stuff (just giving thanks here to not send to much mails to the forum) !

Subject: [Radiance-general] External 'clear' shading
Message-ID: <780003.51767.qm@web26613.mail.ukl.yahoo.com>

Dear Radiance users,

I am new to Radiance.

An existing building is being renovated in order to reduce its need for primary energy and optimize the building envelope daylight penetration. 

I order to reduce the need for cooling an external shading (glass with printing) is used. The data for the shading material is:
Light reflection (for both sides): 30% 
Light transmission:  23%

It is important to include the both parameter (transmission + reflection) in the study in order to clarify possible glare and in order to maximize daylight distribution to the room.

My question is: what material would be the best to use for the shading material in order to model this scene correctly and do I need to include skyfunc and illum for this?

Thank you in advance :)


Best Regards

Per Haugaard

Hi Lucio,

I just wanted to follow-up. I went through the steps of compiling 
radiance on a machine with a relatively stock install of Ubuntu 7.10 
(gutsy) (a workstation install). In order to get Radiance to compile I 
had to add the following using the Synaptics package manager:

    * Libraries (these are needed for compiling stock Radiance)
          o libc6-dev
          o libx11-dev
    * Development (these are needed for compiling libtiff and trad)
          o g++-4.1 - pick a version that matches the level of your
            current gcc
          o tcl 8.4

Note that in using the Synaptics package manger, the system will also 
install any needed dependencies for the above packages, so this is the 
way to go. Note if you do not have csh installed you will also need to 
install csh.

While working through this I also encountered a couple of minor issues 
in the Radiance Head from last week. I passed some fixes along to Greg 
and I believe that an updated Head is available.

With all of this Radiance compiles with no problems. As an additional 
though, if there is enough interest (although learning to compile is a 
good thing to know), I can tar up the binaries I made and make them 
available for download. Let me know.

Hi Per,

If you knew a few more details, such as the type of frit and percent  
coverage, you could use the Radiance glaze script to arrive at a more  
accurate model.  Based on the information you have and a reasonable  
assumption of Rs=0.08, you can use a trans material (also see  
attached excerpt from RwR):

void trans fritted_glass
0
0
7 0.422 0.422 0.422 0.08 0 0.434 0.5

I got this using:

A6 = (Td + Ts) / (Rd + Td + Ts) = 0.23 / (0.23 + 0.30) = 0.434
A5 = Sr = 0
A4 = Rs = 0.08
A3 = A2 = A1 = (Rd - Rs) / ((1-Rs)*(1-A6)) = (0.30 - 0.08)/((1-0.08)* 
(1-0.434)) = 0.422

The only thing that's really a guess is A7, the fraction of specular  
transmission.  This would require an additional measurement or the  
percentage frit coverage.  I guessed 50% coverage.

I hope this helps!

Excerpted pages 325-326 from "Rendering with Radiance" <http:// 
tinyurl.com/2wn78b>:

5.2.6 Modeling Transmitting Media
Some luminaires use semitransparent surfaces to cover the bright  
light sources hidden
inside. This can include downlights and other lensed luminaires. In  
addition,
some daylight control products, such as curtains and fritted glass,  
are most appropriately
modeled as a semispecularly transmitting medium. In these cases, it is
important to know how to properly specify the trans material type to  
accurately
model the appearance of the luminaire or other light-transmitting  
architectural
element.
Specifying a trans material can be intimidating. It is one of the  
most confusing
material entities in the Radiance repertoire. However, it is the  
simplest material that
will trace direct source rays through a semispecular surface in order  
to determine
the diffuse and specular transmitted components.
You will have to measure the following surface properties in  
preparation for the
creation of a trans material type:
? Diffuse reflectance (RGB): The color will affect both diffusely  
reflected light (if
there is any surface roughness) and transmitted light. Call the red,  
green, and
blue components Cr, Cg, and Cb. Calculate the photopic average of the  
RGB
and call this Rd.
? Reflected specularity: As with glass, this is the fraction of light  
that is reflected
off the first surface in a mirror-like way. This we?ll call Rs; it is  
equal to floatingpoint
argument 4, A4.
? Surface roughness (RMS): Facet slope as in plastic. Call this Sr.
? Diffuse transmissivity: Fraction of light that passes all the way  
through the surface
diffusely. Call this Td.
? Transmitted specularity: Fraction of light transmitted as a beam? 
that is, the
fraction of light not diffusely scattered. Call this Ts.
The following formulas can be used to calculate the A7 through A1  
parameters
for the trans material:
A7=Ts / ( Td+Ts )
A6=( Td+Ts ) / ( Rd+Td+Ts )
A5=Sr
A4=Rs
A3=Cb / ( (1-Rs)*(1-A6) )
A2=Cg / ( (1-Rs)*(1-A6) )
A1=Cr / ( (1-Rs)*(1-A6) )
The behavior of trans is regulated by the -st specular threshold  
rendering parameter.
The following formula can be used to determine the appropriate -st  
setting for
rview, rpict, or rtrace to ensure that the transmitted (and  
reflected) semispecular
component will be rendered. The variables A1 through A7 are the first  
through seventh
floating-point arguments to the trans primitive as calculated above.
St = A6 * A7 * (1 - grey(A1, A2, A3) * A4)
Unlike most other Radiance material primitives, the trans material is  
neither
intuitive nor straightforward to apply. It is a good idea to keep  
ample notes for later
reference when you are creating a trans material. Backing out your  
assumptions
from an unannotated trans primitive is difficult.

Subject: [Radiance-general] HEAD - Radiance on Ubuntu - 7.10
Message-ID: <JW54B7$390AF0E9875729F41AC2934A412329FD@libero.it>

Thank you very much Jack !! 

I cannot have access to the laboratory pc 'till thursday, then I'll check your suggested step (at evening just not to spend all the day fixing possible problems! :-P even if I don't think they will occurr).

When tried I'll let you know the exits. 

Just a (hope not too much) stupid question : what does it mean : " g++-4.1 - pick a version that matches the level of your current gcc" ?

At home (where compiling Radiance is possible) I've got all the things you suggested installed in fact. 

I hope I will manage to compile it by myself with your directives, anyhway: what's the machine you have compiled it for? 

Thank you again !

Lucio




.Hi Lucio,
.
.I just wanted to follow-up. I went through the steps of compiling 
.radiance on a machine with a relatively stock install of Ubuntu 7.10 
.(gutsy) (a workstation install). In order to get Radiance to compile I 
.had to add the following using the Synaptics package manager:
.
.    * Libraries (these are needed for compiling stock Radiance)
.          o libc6-dev
.          o libx11-dev
.    * Development (these are needed for compiling libtiff and trad)
.          o g++-4.1 - pick a version that matches the level of your
.            current gcc
.          o tcl 8.4
.
.Note that in using the Synaptics package manger, the system will also 
.install any needed dependencies for the above packages, so this is the 
.way to go. Note if you do not have csh installed you will also need to 
.install csh.
.
.While working through this I also encountered a couple of minor issues 
.in the Radiance Head from last week. I passed some fixes along to Greg 
.and I believe that an updated Head is available.
.
.With all of this Radiance compiles with no problems. As an additional 
.though, if there is enough interest (although learning to compile is a 
.good thing to know), I can tar up the binaries I made and make them 
.available for download. Let me know.
.

Just in case it is not known yet - Radiance is also integrated into ESP-R, a free building simulation system, which will allow you to calculate also thermal behaviour of your design and, most important, supports lots of analysis needs for finding the critical points by e.g. combining internal and external thermal loads over the year. Might be interesting for this project. Be warned, learning curve is even steeper then for Radiance (yes, I guess because it has a GUI ;-)...

CU, Lars.

Hi Lucio,

In the "development" section for Synaptics, you will see g++4.1 and 
perhaps some other versions. You will also note that it will show 
versions for gcc, I believe that you need to install the same version 
number (in this case 4.1, but you should check what gcc you have installed).

The compile that I did is generic, that is I did not make any 
architecture specific settings. So I would hope that this would run on a 
similar linux installation.

-Jack

Then the following should help you:
(every single block is one long line, but copy & paste to a terminal
should work fine due to the added \. I didn't test this, but it should
work).

sudo apt-get install fakeroot build-essential debhelper \
 libtiff4-dev libx11-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libxext-dev dpatch \
 tcsh docbook-to-man ed tk8.4 devscripts

dget -x \
http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/pool/main/r/radiance/radiance_3R8+20080210.dfsg-2.dsc

cd radiance-3R8+20080210.dfsg

dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot

cd ..

ls -l

(.... and there you should have some .deb files to install with dpkg)

sudo dpkg -i *.deb


This version will also be shipped with the next Ubuntu and Debian
releases (if there's no reason to update the package during the freezes).


Cheers,

Bernd

Message-ID: <cdf76d820802140828g12e4f51btd77247f29ecf1787@mail.gmail.com>

All,

I use IES <VE> Radiance among other software to help design teams optimize
daylighting design.

The dilemma is - The same illuminance distribution that's well above the
design fc level under sunny sky conditions is well below that threshold
under standard clear sky. I just double check to make sure it's meeting the
LEED criteria of 75% of space meeting 25 fc at noon on June 21 under clear
sky conditions and it almost never does (I use the standard clear sky in IES
Radiance for that).

What is the difference between the standard clear sky and sunny sky models
within IES Radiance? In the rendered image, I never see solar penetration
into the space under clear sky conditions, what am I missing?

Thanks,

Any help, p?ease?

I think there may be a name collision.  Enter "which genbox" and if  
it doesn't point to the Radiance installed one, then it's something  
else.  You can re-order your PATH environment variable to pick up the  
Radiance one first.

Hi Koti (or Ramana, which one is the name?)

Maybe sun is not penetrating the space you are considering, but just the floor outside or some near walls, and then it bounches in .. this could be discovered with simple geometric analisys or checking differences with ab 0 ab 1 and and ab 2.

Anyhow, I'm not experienced at all with skies. I just red something.

IES only bundles a (to my knowledge rather old) version of Radiance. So
I assume that the sky is generated using the 'gensky' program from the
standard distribution.

There you have the basic sky types of

   * sunny (CIE clear day)
   * intermediate
   * cloudy (CIE overcast day)
   * uniform

plus the option to switch the sun off and on for the first to skies.

> What is the difference between the standard clear sky and sunny sky
> models within IES Radiance?

In plain standard Radiance terms there is not difference between
'sunny sky' and 'clear sky'. You can find out the command used to
create the sky in the sky file that's created by the IES export
to Radiance. In an older version of IES there was an 'obj' folder
that contained all the Radiance scene files. Search for a file with
'.sky' extension or 'gensky' in the content.

> In the rendered image, I never see solar penetration into the space

I would say that the sky model does not include the sun by default.
Makes sense to me because a sun patch would alter your illuminance
levels in the room beyond a point where a simple threshold value
would make sense.

Thomas

Finally, I managed to install the HEAD version, and my system is still running !! 

Thank you Jack !!

I followed your instructions, and actually, nothing changed.. same error reported. So I tried to redirect it to another folder (appositely created) and everything worked ! The only differences were that I did change from system directory (the default one) to home directory. Strange that it didn't work the first .. I was using the sudo command to have access to that directory. Maybe it just had some conflict with the preinstalled (from already compiled binaries) installation.. ? 

Well everything is working proberly now anyway ! let's see if next update I'll have to change directory again!! ;-P

.Hi Lucio,
.
.In the "development" section for Synaptics, you will see g++4.1 and 
.perhaps some other versions. You will also note that it will show 
.versions for gcc, I believe that you need to install the same version 
.number (in this case 4.1, but you should check what gcc you have installed).
.
.The compile that I did is generic, that is I did not make any 
.architecture specific settings. So I would hope that this would run on a 
.similar linux installation.

The dilemma is - The same illuminance distribution that's well above the 
design fc level under sunny sky conditions is well below that threshold 
under standard clear sky. I just double check to make sure it's meeting 
the LEED criteria of 75% of space meeting 25 fc at noon on June 21 under 
clear sky conditions and it almost never does (I use the standard clear 
sky in IES Radiance for that).

-The CIE clear sky is a sky model which has no direct sun input (clear sky 
in Radiance, without sun). Does your LEED criteria refer to real life 
clear sky condition, or the CIE model? Real life clear sky would 
correspond to a sunny sky description.

Kind regards,

Hi,

Thank you Greg,

I was wondering that was referring to a changed command.
(like rview.....). Sorry for that ...  :-(


BTW, I'd like to say thanks to all people here for this amazing and very
kind team of experts in a fantastic software like RADIANCE.
And thank you specially for your great job!

Regards from Brazil,

Vangelis

PS: I'm an architect, I was born in Greece and living in Brazil for a long
time. 
I'm writing my PHD thesis about Real-time interactive visualization of
Global illumination in the process of building design. 
And I'd appreciate to talk about it if anyone else wants to go over the
theme.

I think there may be a name collision.  Enter "which genbox" and if  
it doesn't point to the Radiance installed one, then it's something  
else.  You can re-order your PATH environment variable to pick up the  
Radiance one first.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Calculating daylight factors
Message-ID: <452616.94023.qm@web26612.mail.ukl.yahoo.com>

Dear Radiance Users,

An existing building is being renovated in order to reduce its need for
primary energy and optimize the building envelope for daylight penetration.
I have build a model in Radiance in order to calculate the daylight factors (DF). I am getting some quite hight DF (21% and 32%) 1 meter from the facade which I think are not realistic.

Below is the  model and  data I used to perform the calculation (I am so sorry for the length of this mail):

The dimension of the room are: (w x h x d) 4 x 3 x 16,8 m
Reflectance inside the room are: Walls: 0,7, ceiling: 0,8, floor: 0,3
The dimension of the window are: (w x h) 1,8 x  2,0 m
The window is placed 0,1 m below the ceiling in the middle of the wall facing.  

Some of the date used in Radiance:

# LightShelve  
void trans refl_white

        0       30

The lamellas are placed perpendicular to the window and the lightshelve is placed 0,5 m below the top of the window. The lamellas are placed on the exterior side of the pane and are used as shading on sunny days. The lightshelves are placed both on the interior and exterior side of the window., hence used as shading and to lead the daylight further into the room.

Hereafter I have initiated: 

oconv SkyCIE.rad outside.rad office.mat office.rad window.rad LightShelve_ret.rad Lamella_ret.rad > DF_OfficeLL.oct

and

rtrace -w -h -I+ -ab 15 -aa 0.2 -ad 512 -as 0 -ar 128 DF_OfficeLL.oct < DFcoordinates.inp | rcalc -e '$1=($1*0.265+$2*0.670+$3*0.065)*179/10000*100'

Do the above defined 'rtrace' and 'rcalc' function take fully account for both interreflections between the lamellas?

Can anybody spot why I get the unrealistically hight DFs (or are they unrealistic?) for the office with (21%) the lightshelve and lamellas and without (32%) these two ad ons.

I appreciate any help :)


Best regards 

Per Haugaard

Hi Per,

Looking at what you are doing with rcalc, it looks like you are assuming 
a 10,000 lux overcast CIE sky. While this is fine, you do need to tell 
gensky the output of the desired sky explicitly. To do this you can use 
the -B switch and provide the horizontal diffuse irradiance. This can be 
calculated as 10,000/179 = 55.866 w/m^2. With this your gensky line 
should read:

gensky 6 21 12 -c -a 59.9 -o 10.8 -m -15.00 -B 55.866

With this you should get some different results in your rcalc.

Regards,

-Jack de Valpine

PS: for further reading on this you should take a look at Chapter 6: 
Daylighting Simulation in /Rendering with Radiance/, this chapter is by 
John Mardaljevic.

Hi! I'm here again. 

I've recently discovered I was just using 1/4 of my cpu speed, due the fact that I've got Core2 Quad and I wasn't using parallel rendering.

So I tried to implement it at least for rpict with rpiece.

first time i used it everything worked properly, but relaunching it with some changes, it stops processes reporting : 

rpiece: requested piece (8,6) out of range

Why? 

I'm using this commands from a csh script: 

% echo 8 8 > sync.file
% echo -F sync.file -x 800 -y 600 -o view2.pic $rpict_par $par -vp -20 4 1.5 -vd 1 0 0 scene.oct > args
% rpiece @args &
% rpiece @args &
% rpiece @args &
% rpiece @args &

And is this the right way of using it on a quad processor?

You have to use the -R option instead of the -F option on a restart, I believe.  
>From the manpage:

The /-R/ option may be used instead of /-F/ if some of the pieces were  not

       properly  finished  by  previous  (killed) runs of /rpiece./  This option
       should be used by at most one /rpiece/ process,  which  must  be  started
       first and with /no/ /other/ /rpiece/ /processes/ /running/ or else it will reren-
       der the same pieces other  processes  have  begun.   Once  the  recover
       process  is  started, you may start other /rpiece/ processes using the /-F/
       option to run simultaneously.  If some processes die during  execution,
       leaving one or more half-finished pieces in the picture even though the
       other processes think the work is done, you may  run  a  single  /rpiece/
       with the /-R/ option by itself to repair the holes.

Thank you Rob!

Actually I didn't want to continue an unfinished sequence, but to start a new one. Erasing the 3 files I was creating for the process, didn't work either (in fact the script already was overwriting them, so it was just to not leave anything untried that I tried it). 

I managed just a few minuts ago to solve the problem. Instead of writing the numbers of divisioni to the sync.file as written before, I wrote them in the normal way : -X 8 -Y 8 .

This solved my problem but leaves opened the question on why it didn't work in the other way (as it was copied right from the manual).

Hi Lucio,

It's difficult to say why this didn't work as you originally had it,  
but it's generally a good idea to insert a pause of a couple of  
seconds between each invocation of rpiece, to give it time to lock  
its files.  This isn't reliable on all systems, otherwise.

Thank you Greg!

I imagined it was a wait-period problem, so I tried giving manually some " rpiece @args " invocation after minutes, and it didn't work as well. In addiction, setting -X and -Y directly in args and not in the sync file does work correctly (I've used it many times) withouth any wait-period.

I don't know what else to say, except that it should work.  I checked  
the code, and there's nothing I can see wrong, and it hasn't changed  
for aeons.  There are ongoing issues with the lock manager under  
Linux, and this may be the cause.  As long as you got it to work, I  
wouldn't worry too much about it.  There's not much I can do on my end.

3R8+20080210 means it's version 3R8, updated to HEAD from 2008/02/10.

Btw, if anybody is interested I can upload a backport for Debian/Etch to
backports.org. Same for Lenny when it is released - while I can't update
the released version, I can always provide backports of the version in
testing to the last released version of Debian.

Cheers,

Bernd

If you've installed the Debian package - genbox was renamed there
exactly because of this problem. If you've build radiance from source,
make sure the path to genbox is included in $PATH.

Dear list members:

While getting acquainted with radiance, I stumbled on a phenomenon
that I do not understand.

I keep the following scene description (of a red sphere lonely in vast Euclidean space) in a file called sphere_0.rad

void light SphereLight_0
0 0 3 0.000431188 0 0

SphereLight_0 sphere sphere_0
0 0 4 0 500 0 100

I use oconv and rpict to render the scene and check the output using pvalue.

oconv sphere_0.rad > o.conv
rpict -x 128 -y 128 o.conv | pvalue -o -h -u

The first few lines of output of these commands are

-Y 128 +X 128
     60      95       4.320e-04       9.537e-07       9.537e-07
     62      95       0.000e+00       0.000e+00       0.000e+00
     63      95       4.320e-04       9.537e-07       9.537e-07
     65      95       0.000e+00       0.000e+00       0.000e+00
     67      95       4.320e-04       9.537e-07       9.537e-07
     68      95       0.000e+00       0.000e+00       0.000e+00
     56      94       4.320e-04       9.537e-07       9.537e-07

They demonstrate that am picking up some small power contributions in
the g and b channel which seem suspicious to me. When I use rtrace in an
attempt to reproduce the phenomemon, I find 0 for g and b as I'd expect.

I'd be grateful if somebody could share her/his insight

ps - random observations:

- I have experimented with program options, but even though the defaults
of rtrace and rpict differ slightly, they seem to not be able to explain
rpict's behavior

- A colleague at Fraunhofer ISE checked the pic-file and mentioned to
me that the non-zero contributions are present in the rpict output and
are not created later by pvalue

Hello Stefan,

This is simply the round-off error associated with the Radiance RGBE  
format.  Since the picture format uses three mantissas with a common   
exponent, it is not possible to represent a non-zero value in one  
channel and a zero value in another channel.  Even though the actual  
byte stored for green and blue may be zero in your calculation, the  
decoder will interpret this as half a count out of 255 and give a  
corresponding value.

Since the main purpose of Radiance is lighting calculations for  
visual simulation, and the eye's color channels have a (more or less)  
linear response, this is an appropriate/adequate representations for  
the design application.  If you need the original floating point  
values, and don't mind files than are about 5 times bigger, you can  
use vwrays with rtrace and output floating point images directly.

I hope this helps.
-Greg

I'm having some problems exporting geometry from Ecotect - I'm trying to
model some external shades.  I've tried to build them up as 3D surfaces
but when I export and render only the two side pieces are visible, the
small top, bottom, back and front faces do not appear.  What am I doing
wrong?

The rest of the Radiance/Ecotect files are in the same directory if
anyone wants to take a look.

Thanks for your help,

Nick

Hello Nick,

I downloaded your files and from looking at your geometry briefly I would say that Ecotect i.e. you created some very small polygons (0.0001 meters on one side) that Radiance considers zero-area polygons. When I run oconv or getbbox on your scene file I get 28 warnings like this one:

getbbox: warning - zero area for polygon "zone02.rad00000"  

Looking at polygon zone02.rad00000 I find a valid polygon description but I guess Radiance has some limitation with regards to geometry. Are you sure you are modelling in the correct scale?

Regards,
 Erwin

Thanks very much Erwin.  That seems to have been the problem. 
Ecotect's Radiance output assumes the model dimensions are in
millimetres and by default scales everything it exports by 0.001.  Turns
out I was modelling in metres.  Oops.

Message-ID: <DIIE.00001A870002C6E8@192.168.0.81>

You're welcome, I'm glad my guess was correct. Btw, I often get geometry - esp. from landscape or road planning departments - and they always use the local coordinate system. That means you would have X/Y/Z like 82045.5708,235594.1030,587.4538. 

When your model ist that far away from 0,0,0 you have to expect problems. For instance running an interactive 'rview/rvu' session it will be hard to fine tune your view-point/direction settings because (from memory) if you have a 6 digit number like the y coord above rview will cut off everything after the 6 digits. Am I making sense? 

Anyway, I dont have time (nor experience) to analyze the radiance code but somewhere in the source tree you would find certain #define statements that determine the limitations of all geometry coordinates.  
My workaround is to 'move' the whole model (close) to 0,0,0 either in the CAD program proir to export or with the xform -t $x $y $z tool within Radiance. 

HTH,
 Erwin

Is this really true? I would expected the bounding cube determination
and octree structure to solve that?

Well, I'm somewhat familiar with the code, and I can't even tell  
you.  I know there are places where formatting limits the number of  
significant figures produced in the scene files, but xform at least  
tries not to lose too much.  I also know that a frozen octree  
converts the 64-bit floating point value to a 32-bit mantissa (with  
sign bit) and an 8-bit exponent, which maintains about 9 significant  
decimal digits.  If what matters to you is in the 8th or 9th decimal  
place, you're in dangerous territory.  (By comparison, a 64-bit IEEE  
double has about 15 significant digits.)

So, I agree with Erwin's recommendation of applying xform in cases  
where you are starting to strain your significant digits,  
particularly if you are putting your scene into a frozen octree.  It  
is also a good idea to work in world units that don't make your  
coordinate values too large or too small (large being on the order of  
10^8 and small being on the order of 10^-4).

Hello -

I have been trying to get Radiance loaded to my OS X system (v. 10.4.11).  I am new to UNIX, so the process has been a bit rocky - but - makeall install and makeall library worked out (mostly) fine, and I changed the /etc/profile file to include RAYPATH, and everything seemed to be working fine.  Commands like genprism work and the .oct file built OK.  However, when I went to run rview I get this error:

rview: cannot open X-windows; DISPLAY variable set?
rview: fatal - cannot initialize x11

I have tried setting DISPLAY=0 and no effect.  I even went so far as to write this little ditty into  /etc/profile on  the advice of a radiance-general user:

if [ -z "${DISPLAY}" ];then echo -n
export DISPLAY=':0'
fi

also, no luck.  So, now I am begging the wisdom of more advanced users.

any advice?

thanks a million

Dave

I hope it doesn't sound too condescending, but do you have X11 
installed? I used "fink" to install a variety of Unix-like tools, 
and it installs X11 in the process.

Hi Dave,

Like Mark suggests, you may not have X11 installed (or running).  It  
is still an optional install on many versions of Mac OS X, but it's  
there under the Optional Installs of your system disk.  If you can't  
find it there, you can also download it from Apple's website.  There  
should be no need to compile it, but you will have to run it before  
starting rvu.

Best,
-Greg

Greg,

Right---it should be on the OSX disc. I've found that X11 runs 
itself when I run rvu. Tell us how it goes, Dave.

No, I had to install X11 to run Matlab.  I have installed: X11 1.1.3 - XFree86 4.4.0

Does rview usually open up x11 on its own, or do I have to boot it up separately?

finally, is rvu the same as rview?

thanks for getting back to me so quickly!

cheers

Dave,

I thought X11 started on its own (I have OSX 10.5.2). I don't 
know what the problem might be, then.

rvu == rview   (Unless the rview from the vim package appears 
before Radiance in the PATH)

No, you have to load X11 first.  I have some code in my .profile that  
automatically loads X11 when I open a terminal window (if it's not  
already running) since many times when I open a terminal window I'm  
about to use Radiance, but you could just remember to start up X11  
prior to running any of the graphical Radiance apps.

Mark got this one already; it was renamed to avoid a very common  
alias conflict on most Linux systems (with vim).

That's new in 10.5.x.  If he's got an older version of Mac OS he has  
to start it like any other app.

Hi All,

can any one please guide me in installing radiance on Ubuntu 7.10 . I have
tried to install using the online help at this website
ttp://www.bozzograo.net/radiancewiki/doku.php/standard_unix_distribution<http://www.bozzograo.net/radiancewiki/doku.php/standard_unix_distribution>)
but it doesn't seem to work . is there any specific tutorial or web link
where i can download both the binaries and installation instruction.

my basic reason for installing radiance on ubuntu or Linux based platform is
to ultimately use the radmap program with in radiance,which is not compiled
for windows based systems as of now.

thank you,

Hi Adityia.

What is the problem with the tutorial you found online? I could try helping you since I recently followed and have been helped about it.

If you prefer not to follow that way at this address:

http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/dist/rad3R8_linux.tar.gz

there are the binaries for linux. 

You just have to place them in your favourite directory, say ~/radiance/bin for binaries and ~/radiance/lib for libraries and put these lines in ,bashrc :

export PATH=.:~/radiance/bin:$PATH
export RAYPATH=.:~/radiance/lib

Aditya,

There are some .deb files for debian/ubuntu here:
http://radiance-online.org/software/binaries/rad3R8_linux.tar.gz

Usually when I build from scratch I need to install tk8.3 and csh from the
ubuntu repo, so maybe you are just missing those dependencies (I did not see
tk8.3 in the tutorial's list to apt-get and I'm not sure if tcsh is the same
as csh or not). One other thing to check is taht typically when you're in
Ubuntu Bash or Dash is the default shell. I usually run into problems when
running makeall for radiance in either of these two shells, so try using Csh
instead while compiling.

Hope that helps!
Dave

Hi Aditya, Lucio and Dave,

In order to get Radiance to compile on Ubuntu 7.10 (stock workstation 
install), I needed to install the following (using synaptics package 
manager):

   1. from Libs
         1. libc6-dev
         2. libx11-dev
   2. from Development
         1. g++-4.1 (get the version that matches your installed gcc)
         2. tcl8l.4
   3. also you will need csh, which can be easily obtained using apt-get
      as Dave already pointed out

Note also you could try installing the Debian Radiance package for 
compiled binaries:

    http://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy/graphics/radiance

However this appears to be for Hardy (8.04 development release) so I do 
not know if there are any issues running it on Gutsy (7.10 stable release).

Best,

-Jack

Subject: [Radiance-general] ETFE material definition
Message-ID: <BLU133-W560AC8BD368E170AEA38FC71A0@phx.gbl>


Hi,
 
I'm brand new to RADIANCE but have decided to try and use it as part of my final year BEng thesis which is titled 'New Transparent Structures and Historic Buildings'. As part of this project, I am modelling 3 existing internal courtyard spaces, one of which is the Annenberg Court at the National Gallery. This has a single pillow, ETFE rooflight - has anyone ever modelled ETFE on RADIANCE before? If so, please could you let me know how you did it?
 
Thank you!
 
Amy

Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance and radmap installers for window$
Message-ID: <1204244935.10650.11.camel@leviathan>

Hi all,

For the lazy window$ users out there, I have put together
a couple of setup programmes that should make it easier
to install non-visual Radiance programmes and radmap:

MinGW Radiance 3R8 setup:
http://www.bozzograo.net/radiancewiki/doku.php/windows_alternatives
(does not include rvu, ximage, etc.)

Radmap
http://www.bozzograo.net/radiancewiki/doku.php/radiance_based_software#radmap
(follow the link that redirects to the download page and get the 
package with the "new" tag)

Please post all your questions about radmap to the b/rad mailing list:
brad@nongnu.org

Ciao,

Francesco

Hi Francesco Anselmo ,

thank you for being very generous towards the so called sluggish window$
users. i badly needed to use the radmap under windows environment for my
college project and thanks to you for providing us with necessary radiance
programs .

I have installed Ubuntu 7.10 in an attempt to make a transition for windows
to the linux (open source). i will join the open source club shortly. i am
still a toddler in using both radiance and linux based OS.

thank you,
