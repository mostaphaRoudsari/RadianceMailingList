Message-ID: <200801031611.m03GBFO8031053@omr5.networksolutionsemail.com>

Hi all,

 

I have a question regarding extracting values from a pic file (pvalue
program?). 

 

-           Is there a way to extract the values just for a portion of
picture (rather than getting it for a single pixel or the whole picture)?

-           Also, are we able to get values just for an irregular polygon
portion of the picture?  

 

Thanks a lot. 

 

 

Prasanta

Are you an a Mac?
Photosphere allows you to draw a rectangle anywhere on the pic and it shows values.
No way to get an irregular polygon as far as I know.

Hello Prasanta,

As Rob points out, Photosphere may be used to compute the average  
value for a portion of an image.  The ximage viewer may be used in  
the same way.  If you need this computed in "batch mode" or want all  
the pixel values for a rectangular section, you can pass the picture  
through pcompos before sending it to pvalue.  (However, be aware that  
the -o option of pvalue will not work for pictures passed through  
pcompos.)

There is no convenient facility to get the pixels from a non- 
rectangular region of a picture, but using the following syntax:

	pvalue -o -h -H result.pic | rcalc -e 'cond=func($1,$2)' -e '$1=179* 
(.265*$3+.670*$4+.065*$5)'

you can produce the luminance values for every pixel where func(x,y)  
is greater than zero.  Naturally, you must define this function also  
on the rcalc command line, and creating one for a polygon is not that  
easy.  An example function that would get luminance values along a  
diagonal extending from the lower-left of the image to the upper- 
right would be:

	-e 'func(x,y)=equal(x,y);equal(a,b):if(a-b+.5,b-a+.5,-1)'

I hope this makes some kind of sense.

If you have a way to create the mask you want on the image (in  
Photoshop or whatever), you can use the following nonsense to average  
over only these values.  (I assume the input mask is in PPM format,  
but it could be TIFF or whatever.)

        ra_ppm -r mask.ppm \
                 | pvalue -h -H -pG -df \
                 | rlam -if - "\!pvalue -h -H -o -b -df result.pic" \
                 | rcalc -if2 -of -e 'cond=$1-.5;$1=$2' \
                 | total -if -m

The backslash before the exclamation mark is only necessary for the C- 
shell, so you might have to remove that.

Best,
-Greg

Tank you very much Thomas and Carsten but it looks like I still have problems:

It is impossible for me to use eulum2ies . I tries it in ubuntu 7.10 64 bit and it doesn't work [core dumped] (maybe 'cou8se of 64 bit architecture) so I tried it under windows in cygwin.. agai core dumped even if there are some more explanations: 

17537 [main] eulum2ies 3792 _cygtls::handle_exceptions: Error while dumping state <probably corrupted stack> 
Segmentation fault <core dumped> 

So, no way for me to use it.. ah, probably it is important to say that while compiling it it is reporting : 

eulum2ies.c:71: warning: built-in function 'pow' declared as non-function


I quite understand nothing from this.. do you? 

I managed to convert from eulum to ies with ies2tab a program for ms-dos written in pascal, but I still have doubts about the correct translation.. it looks like distribution is still ok, but it has some offset. If I rotate the luminaire around z axis, and I check with illuminance curves on an orizzonatal plane, the distribution is not rotating around its most luminouse point (as i guess it was supposed to do.. ) but it has an offset of almost 10 units, then 10 meters.. 

Do you have any suggestion on how to solve this problem? Is this really a problem or am I missing something? Can you suggest me any other converter at least to check that both them are working the same way ?

Thank you very much in advance.. 

Lucio

.ies2rad has a limited knowledge on lamp types. The search patterns are
.defined in the "lamp.dat" file in your Radiance installation.  
.Manufacturers
.now tend to use a product name in their lamp specification which is
.harder to identify.
.
.If ies2rad fails to identify the lamp type it prints this warning
.and uses a default lamp type with neutral white colour. This is
.fine for most simulations (in particular Lux levels). When you're
.interested in the actual rendering of the lamp colour you can use the
.-t option of ies2rad to tell it which lamp type to use. Look in the
.'lamp.dat' file for the specification.
.
.Please not that you only have to worry about this if you have different
.lamp types in your scene. You can also change the colour balance of
.an existing image to simulate this effect with pfilt.

.
.Support for new data file formats would be nice but given the number
.of conversion tools out there it's probably not worth the effort.
.
.Happy new year.

Hi Lucio.

Sorry. I can't comment on the compile errors. It's quite a while since I
used and compiled eulum2ies and then I did it on a Mac. Your problems  
might
be specific to your distribution/version of the libraries.

I don't know ies2tab. I used and still would use Dialux on Windows if I
had to deal with photometry a lot. You can import LDT, IES and some  
other
data formats into Dialux and then export the photometry as IES if  
required.
If you have a converted IES file load it into Dialux and compare it  
to the
LDT version in the 3D editor. If you get the same distribution shape and
specs it's ok.

The good thing about Dialux is that it's more or less a marketing tool
for the manufacturers and therefore is very well supported by their
technical departments. Most big manufacturers have dedicated databases
with their products for Dialux or a good online import function.

I'm not quite sure what your problem is. Do you have trouble
to verify your converted data file or to place it in a Radiance
scene? If it's the first use a photometric viewer software (as Dialux)
to check it.

Regards,
Thomas

Thanks very much Thomas for your reply !

About compile errors, I'm quite sure they depend on distribution and/or architecture.. !!
 
In my last mail I did a mistake.. ies2tab is either for msdos and linux and I actually used linux version (I said I was using dos version). 

Then I tried eulumcnv (this one is really for dos) and conversion apparently (but I have to check it better) gave quite same results, just little differences in third decimal point (but I just checked it fastly. 

I did try, as you suggested me, to import in diualux and compare, and well, converted lights are really different from their counterpart in dialux's database. 

My problem is that my eulumdat file is in .eul format, not in .ldt format. I tried ranaming it and dialux doesn't manage it properly (it gives preview in windows' explorer but it doesn't import it. 

And I tried to export lights from dialux's database in .ies format, but I didn't find the command. Where is it? is it just to export luminaries  not from databases ? Do I need a plugin? 

Thank you in advance

Ciao Lucio,

Perhaps sending a link to the Eulumdat file can help us debug your
problems.

You can try downloading this GNU/linux binary of Carsten's programme
to see if it helps:
http://www.bozzograo.net/radiance/modules.php?op=modload&name=Downloads&file=index&req=viewdownload&cid=4

You can also use the eulumcnv.exe binary 
http://www.helios32.com/eulumcnv.exe
from Gnu/Linux using wine (wine eulumcnv.exe file.ldt)
To install wine on Ubuntu or any Debian based distro: 
sudo apt-get install wine

The extension for the eulumdat file should not have any impact 
on the converters, as long as the file follows the Eulumdat standard:
http://www.helios32.com/Eulumdat.htm

For more info on the IES standard:
http://lumen.iee.put.poznan.pl/kw/iesna.txt 

You can easily build your own IES file using this information
from a table of candela values, that is already in your eulumdat file.

Buona fortuna,

Francesco

Thanks Greg & Rob for your quick response.

I am using radiance on Linux and I am relatively a new user (both
radiance & Linux). I'm sure it's going to take some time for me to
understand Greg's syntax and be able to use it. So for now, I will try
to find a Mac and do calculations on photosphere. 

Thank You so much.

I have run across a few times on the web, diagrams that show the sun position over the course of say 6 months.
I can't recall what that chart-type is called, but it looks somthing like this:
http://www.rastermon.com/images/SunPath.gif

I used a tool from University of Oregon, 
http://solardat.uoregon.edu/SunChartProgram.html

then Photoshop'd my obviously fake green line indicating the sun's position.
They show up in these figure-8 patterns.

Anyone know a way to produce them?

 Apologies if this comes through twice... not sure if I sent it to the
correct address the first time.


I have run across a few times on the web, diagrams that show the sun
position over the course of say 6 months.
I can't recall what that chart-type is called, but it looks somthing
like this:
http://www.rastermon.com/images/SunPath.gif

I used a tool from University of Oregon,
http://solardat.uoregon.edu/SunChartProgram.html

then Photoshop'd my obviously fake green line indicating the sun's
position.
They show up in these figure-8 patterns.

Anyone know a way to produce them?

Thanks
Rob F

Hi Rob,

Axel Jacobs has a nice page explaining these diagrams here:

http://www.learn.londonmet.ac.uk/packages/clear/visual/daylight/analysis/hand/sunpath_diagram.html

Ecotect is one commercially-available program that can produce these 
charts.  Francesco Anselmo created a python script to overlay these on a 
Radiance fisheye view, which is very cool, but I never was able to use 
it correctly.

The figure eight pattern is called an analemma, and there are some cool 
links with info about this as well:

I had a sunpath diagram in my old Blender exporter. The code still
exists but I haven't looked at it in a while. IIRC you could also use
a fisheye image as background (it's the round version with the zenith
at the top, not the one in your image).

I don't think I ever managed PDF output. So all you could create is
a screenshot.

Message-ID: <3acd9e4a0801100614h69ca8718hb64104c897171242@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I'm doing UV analysis from UV lamp with radiance, and it looks like going
well. But i got a problem nearby the cylindric UV lamp. In my model, the UV
lamp passes through 2 walls, and there comes out a black shadow the wall
around the lamp. My rpict options are -i to see the surface radiation and
-ds 0.01. Could you explain why this problem occurs and how to solve it?

Hi Minki,

It is not clear to me what your geometry is supposed to represent.

    case 1 - If you have 2 polygons representing "walls" and 1 cylinder
    representing your source, where the cylinder passes through the
    walls, you are going to have problems due to how the light source
    sampling occurs along the linear source.

    case 2 - if the geometry is supposed to represent a cylindrical
    source that passes through a hole cut in each wall, then you
    probably need to make sure that your "wall" geometry has a holes cut
    out as needed for the cylinder to pass through.

Note also if what you are trying to do is model an actual fixture with 
reflector elements of some sort and simulate the output distribution, then
Radiance is probably not the right tool, you will need to look into a 
forward raytracer of some sort. I am sure that others on the list can 
advise on what might be an appropriate tool.

Hello everyone, 

I have a question regarding the luminaire output multiplier and I would really appreciate your help.

I am doing an experiment in a testbed, however, the inside natural lighting is very low, because of the sorrounding neightbouring walls so we decided to use an artificial uniform light (160x 160 cm) in the window as the light source, -looking at the values for different blind positions and based on a controller, some decisions are made regarding the blind position and the lighting inside the space. 

My question is how to continuously change the lumen multiplier output (-m) , so without  entering the -m value every time manually. I am an researcher in architecture, and I do not have good knowledge in programming.

 ies2rad -dm -t default -m 1.0   TPH710_8xTL5-28W_827_865_HFR.ies

xform -rx 90 -t 4.52 -0.05  1.455 TPH710_8xTL5-28W_827_865_HFR.rad > artificial light.rad

Message-ID: <JUHQOE$FEAB6E889B3890C25BEA45E2A458DE60@libero.it>

Hi it looks like my thesys target is changing direction, but it is not decided yet, anyway, my teacher and I were curios is someone did already the tests I'm going to write about. Else I would do that, and it could be  interesting for the whole community.

So ... it exists a tachnical report from  CIE which is titled "Test cases to asses the accuracy of lighting computer programs". Briefly, it contains some sets os cenes well described to be reproduced and computed in any software.. 

If nobody did those tests using radiance, it could be a nice goal for my thesys to complete them or some of them at least.. If somebody already did them, I'd like to look at them, if possible.

And.. well.. do you think it could be interesting for everybody ?

Thank you

I'm sure you should find quite a few rendering packages in the open  
source
corner that would even work on Solaris. They might not be all that  
easy to
use, though. But then neither is Radiance.

First thing: You need to have development tools installed (c- 
compiler, etc).

Second: It should be "makeall install" (but I think that's what you  
wanted to say).

Third: It certainly did not do "nothing". The command line "makeall  
install" will have
some sort of result. Even a "command not found" would tell us more  
about your problems.

I assume you had your reasons but I'd have used something like a
glow rectangle to create a non-specific light source.

You can pack these two lines in  a script an surround them with a  
"for ..." loop:

Loose the spaces in the file names! The shell will see "artificial"  
and "light.rad"
as two file names to search for. Use "artificial_light.rad" instead.

Suggestion: save your data point one per line in a file  
"my_data_points.dat"
and read from the file. "echo" will do that, too.

I assume you had your reasons but I'd have used something like a
glow rectangle to create a non-specific light source.

Dear Lucio,

Funnily enough, I was actually going to give this very task to one of
my students this year. I think it's well worth doing as an exercise.

There is a validation of Relux (and I think one other software
package) based on the CIE technical report. If I remember correctly,
Relux worked all right, but they discovered that the CIE overcast sky
definition was implemented incorrectly in Relux, which it's now fixed.
If you cant' find  the report on the Net, get back to me, and I'll try
to dig it out.

There are two things that you should be aware of with such a validation:

a) The test cases are all VERY basic. This is because the reference
results are derived analytically (pen on paper). This is to make them
100% correct, but the downside is that the scenarios can't be very
complex. Radiance, however, excels exactly in such cases difficult
cases which can only be validated though elaborate measurements in
real spaces (See J. Mardaljevic, C. Reinhard)

b) Much of Radiance's accuracy is based on the operator's experience
and him setting the ambient parameters correctly. I feel this would
have to be quite a large part of this assessment: How to get them
right, and the penalty of not getting them spot-on.

Those are my thoughts on the subject. I am looking forward to reading
your report, and wish you best of luck with it.

Was there some Radiance integration for ARRIS? Have to remember....

One note to Bill: There are two ways: compiling yourself and installing 
precompiled. I do not even know what way you went, because you did not 
tell us what package you downloaded where. There used to be compiled 
Radicance binaries for Solaris on the official site, but I am not sure 
for which releases and platforms. So, as others already wrote, first get 
compilers (you can get the optimized C compilers for free from Sun, do 
not waste your time with gcc on a Solaris installation), than makeall 
install. I used to install into /opt/radiance-max.min on Solaris as this 
was the way most packages where handled on my Sun.

Good luch! CU Lars.

I thought some of them were actually based on physical scenarios, in  
fact on Mardaljevic's scenarios, but then I only skimmed the report.

I don't know what is happening.. could someone help me?

Some time ago, I installed radiance on my pc at home . after troubling a little 'couse of inexperience, I managed doing it, don't remember what did I do to solve it, but as I did not write down anything it should have been novice's things!

Now I'm trying to install it in my laboratory at university.. still in ubuntu.. but something again is not working

so, from the right directory (/home/administrator/Scrivania/ray) I'm launching "sudo ./makeall install" and the result is an huge anount of errors.. beginning with :

Hi Lucio,

It looks like the server does not have the c development libraries 
installed since you are getting compile errors relating to fundamental 
things like stdio.h. You should run the package manager and check if the 
c libraries are installed.

Thank you very much for the fast reply Jack! That's probable.. but.. 


How to know which libraries to look for and install ?

Thank you very much for your reply Axel..

I did thought as well some cases were based on real measurement but I did read too it quite fastly.

According to Antonutto someone else already did that validation..  So, there's no need to repeat it (even if actually I'm not able to find this research on the web). 

Anyway.. in an hour I will talk with my teacher to plan something.. 

As about Relux I didn't look for report, 'couse I don't think it could be interesting to me.. if you see it differently, please, tell me why ! 

Thank you again !!

.Funnily enough, I was actually going to give this very task to one of
.my students this year. I think it's well worth doing as an exercise.
.
.There is a validation of Relux (and I think one other software
.package) based on the CIE technical report. If I remember correctly,
.Relux worked all right, but they discovered that the CIE overcast sky
.definition was implemented incorrectly in Relux, which it's now fixed.
.If you cant' find  the report on the Net, get back to me, and I'll try
.to dig it out.
.
.There are two things that you should be aware of with such a validation:
.
.a) The test cases are all VERY basic. This is because the reference
.results are derived analytically (pen on paper). This is to make them
.100% correct, but the downside is that the scenarios can't be very
.complex. Radiance, however, excels exactly in such cases difficult
.cases which can only be validated though elaborate measurements in
.real spaces (See J. Mardaljevic, C. Reinhard)
.
.b) Much of Radiance's accuracy is based on the operator's experience
.and him setting the ambient parameters correctly. I feel this would
.have to be quite a large part of this assessment: How to get them
.right, and the penalty of not getting them spot-on.
.
.Those are my thoughts on the subject. I am looking forward to reading
.your report, and wish you best of luck with it.

Hi Lucio,

If the machine is not yours to do with as you please, I would suggest 
contacting your system administrator.

Under ubuntu you can use the package manager. You can search for libc6 
and libc6-dev to see if they are installed. Alternatively you could just 
download compiled binaries and see if they work.

Alternatively, you can check for compiled binaries at

     www.radiance-online.org

additionally it looks like there is a radiance package available for the 
latest Ubuntu (I assume via the recent efforts to include radiance in 
Debian by Bernd Zeimetz) at:

    http://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy/graphics/radiance

Hi,

if you installed the compiled binaries, there is no need to run the 
makeall script. This one is needed to build and install from sources.

I do not know where the binaries got installed (I guess something like 
in /opt or /usr/local), but you should set RAYPATH, maybe PATH, and go 
using radiance.

If you download the sources, you will need a compiler, make, maybe some 
other tools found on most systems, and run makeinstall. The contributer 
who created the binary package already did this for you!

CU Lars.

3.6 is old! You should have downloaded 3.8 from the official site.
Doesn't matter to you at the moment but please remember to report
your version (and platform) if you have any troubles and want to ask
the mailing list.

The Readme files are sources of wisdom! You should read them all!

Right path. The ultimate step is to buy the book 'Rendering with  
Radiance'.

> like?

Read the README again, in particular the part that starts with:

     "The most important program to learn about if you are a
     new user ..."

Then read the man page for 'rad' (and every other Radiance
app you are going to use).

The basic idea is this:

First there is a lot of text files describing your scene geometry.
You convert these files to a scene file ("octree") with the command
'oconv'. Then you run 'rpict' (for images) or 'rtrace'/'rtcontrib'
with this scene as input to create your desired output.

You can find a few examples bundled with the source code in the
'obj' directory. Unfortunately they also contain a bit of shell
scripting which makes the whole think look more complicated than
it is.

The best (free) beginner tutorial IMO are Axel Jacobs' course
notes for his Radiance course:

http://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/learnix/docs.shtml

Read those, follow the exercises and try to understand what's
going on in the example scenes.

The one and only interface for Radiance is the shell. Amen.

There are some interfaces/exporters/converters for CAD and
3D apps which will help you with creating the scene geometry
(I think Arris has been mentioned already).

Getting the materials and rendering parameters right, however,
is a source of endless frustration|joy [delete as appropriate].

> Please help, again.

Looking back at your earlier emails I get the impression that
you are more interested in pictures than lighting analysis.
See if you can find something about this (old) Arris to Radiance
converter to get your CAD into Radiance format. If that doesn't
work there is a script for Blender that should work on Solaris.
If you can create '.obj' files you can convert those to Radiance
with a tool included in the distribution.

That should keep you busy for a while.

Regards,
Thomas

Hi!

> input. What concerns me is that my 3D models can get very complex.

Than it is even better to stay on the command line, you can e.g. have 
one model for the landscape, one for the building, one for trees etc. 
and combine them using command line techniques even without opening the 
files. Believe me, when working on complex file sets, you will love 
command line work after a while! Have a look at renderings of a highly 
detailed model (down to 1.5cm) of Hagia Sophia in Istanbul we did using 
only lots of small files and shell scripting to combine them - a model 
noone will be able to open at once in a conventional CAD (sorry for the 
ultralong URL) for the near future:

> How do I know what wall I'm working on or the color of the staircase

You "alias" the layer names to materials in a library, e.g.

> How do I choose the locations of light sources, such as a table
> lamp without seeing it in model form?

One way to do this is to place a triangle "marker" on a layer called 
"table_lamp" and have the radiance command "replmarks" replace all 
markers on that layer with the lamp geometry and illuminaire description.

We will have to check for the export routes. I love obj, but it looks 
like this one is not supported by Arris. dxf is fine with dxf2rad 
(www.schorsch.com). But there may be other ways, too, if you could 
export to the old arris format e.g., or use 3rd party tools (I love 
brlcad as a converter tool, but there are others).

There is a standalone version for Solaris, too. But as I told you - 
Rayfront is a great tool for professionals, as it supports a workflow 
and libraries, but it does not make it "easy" to render with Radiance. 
You will need an understanding of what important tools Radiance offers, 
what input and processing parameters are needed to describe and process 
a scene for the simulation (you would need that with a GUI as well), and 
the rest is to develop a workflow for your needs. Actually, if you will 
have established that workflow, this might be reduced to one script 
calling the converters, referencing you libraries and viewfiles and 
running the rendering process incl. preview and converions all at once - 
but you must know what happens, because in most cases you will want to 
tweak some settings or just better understand the resuts.

Really, the tutorials are a great help to avoid frustration and losing 
time by "just trying".

CU Lars.

DAYLIGHTING STRATEGIES CAN DIFFER WITH CLIMATE" i am using radiance and
daysim. when i execute the gendaylit command with the following parameters
 gendaylit -ang 60 0 -p 6.3 0.12 the following error shows up " file
coeff_perez.dat cannot be opened"  and "lect_coeff_perez does not work". also
can i have having problems in view the sky using rview , can any one suggest
me right parameters to view the sky .

i am running radiance on a windows machine and executing the commands at DOS
shell.

If it does not work - you can export to Sketchup from Arris, and the 
Sketchup-Format is supported by Thomas Bleicher's converter:

http://code.google.com/p/su2rad/

If there are problems, you can send a typical model (not to the list) in 
  obj and sketchup format to check which way will work with Radiance.

I still wonder if there was not a direct export... I remember something 
like the export interface in Octree CAD had been developed from a Arris 
version, but I may be wrong.

You will need a nice material library for that. Radiance can transport 
the light, but you have to define the reflecting surfaces ;-)

This suggests that all your Radiance binaries are installed in /usr/ 
local/bin/.

Can you find a file /usr/local/bin/rad? (just try 'ls -l /usr/local/ 
bin/rad')

It does not matter where the binaries for Radiance are installed as long
as you have the directory path in your PATH environment variable. If  
everything
is installed in /usr/local/radiance3.8/ you need an entry for $PATH like
'/usr/local/radiance3.8:/usr/bin:...'. Typically the application  
specific
directories are first in the list, followed by the general system  
directories.

RAYPATH is used by Radiance internally. If a file can not be found  
immediately
in the current scene directory. I don't have it defined on my system and
Radiance works fine (it may be essential for the first example scenes  
you'r
going to use, though!).

As far as I can see '/opt/Radiance3.8a/ray' is not in your PATH (I  
assume you
didn't delete anything that is directly related to Radiance.) Path names
on Unix systems are case sensitive, btw.

Please look for the directory that contains 'rad', 'rpict' and 'rtrace'.
This directory is where all your executables are installed and this  
should
be in your PATH.

BTW: You can always run a program with the full path
(i. e. '/opt/Radiance3.8a/ray/bin/rad scene.rif') but that's neither  
convenient
nor will it help you if a Radiance binary is called from within a scene
file.

Hello Steve,

A few more details are needed to help with your problem, such as:

1) The exact location of your building (longitude, latitude, time  
zone, orientation)

2) The time of day/year you are trying to recreate

3) The options you are currently using for gensky, assuming that's  
what you are using

As Greg already pointed out check your location options.
The default location in Sketchup is Boulder/CO.

Also Sketchup assumes that your North direction is at the top
of the screen if you're in a plan view (+y if +z is height).

The conversion of Sketchup settings to gensky parameters
works on Macs rather well. On Windows the locations data file
is named differently which I haven't taken care of yet.

You can reduce the QUALITY setting in the .rif file to increase
the speed of the preview image. You can increase the 'ab' setting
separately ('render=' option in the rif file) if the settings
rad would create are too low.

Mark this almost solved..
Well I am using Sketchup export with SU2RAD. Initially, I was trying to view the sunpatchs on the far wall and floorplan with viewer's back to the window. When I rendered with the view towards the window opening (and gensky with +s sunny sky) I couldn't 'see' the sun patch. But when I checked with sketchup, I could see where a sunpatch should be, but it didn't appear in the render. To make sure ,I used sketchup shadow with time and location that shows a sunpatch clearly. Time is set 07:49am EST in sketchup; after export the generated sky file shows:

!gensky 10 31 +02:49 -a 45.52 -o 73.57 -m 75.0 +s -g 0.2 -t 1.7| xform -rz -0.0

obviously not what I wanted..So it renders correctlafter I manualy set the time to 07:49....could it be the exporter causing the 5hr difference???

As I replied to Greg, I set the sketchup location and time to what was required for the simulation. And the north direction as well.
Somehow the export creates a five hour difference. 

Is there a time-zone setting in the SU2RAD ruby script?

Steve

I just checked what the script is doing. The time zone information
is taken from the ShadowTime setting in Sketchup (a Ruby Time
object). I assume the conversion to HH:MM takes the time zone
of your computer into account although the setting in the Shadow
dialog is always GMT (or GMT+1).

I'll try to find a fix for this.

Thomas

I have never heard of this validation being carried out for Radiance.
Does anybody know anything about it? I'd be very interested...

That's up to you.

Here is the link:

The validation was carried out for Relux and Lightscape.

The actual CIE benchmark paper is only available for money.

hi Lucio,

The advantages of ray tracing will become evident when you read 
"Rendering with Radiance", and start using the software.  A really good 
text on radiosity is "Radiosity and Gobal Illumination" by Sillion.  
Apparently, the entire text is available online these days at Google Books:

http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&id=h2PP-lpWY84C&dq=radiosity+sillion&printsec=frontcover&source=web&ots=Z3iepCSU7O&sig=nyjipt7owAwLOnm3_IJtez0BHxM#PPP1,M1

Another good one that covers both methods is "Advanced Global 
Illumination", which can also be viewed at Google Books here:

http://books.google.com/books?id=D0HMgNoDzRYC&pg=PA318&dq=rendering+with+radiance&sig=5wLiL0sRc-G8bnId3LXoVe3HNYk&vq=%22Rendering+with+Radiance%22#PPR9,M1

Have a fun trip!  Radiance is a lot of fun.

By the way, am I late to this Google Books party?  Greg & Rob S., 
perhaps this is a good venue for RwR?  Apparently each author can decide 
how much of the book to make browsable; maybe posting the tutorial 
chapters and the juicy chapters at the end could be of great use for the 
community, and generate some hard copy sales as well?  If interested, 
here's the FAQ:

Hi Prasanta,
 
I'm not sure how (in terms of code) you're trying to extract the luminance values and how you'd be processing them, but I've faced a similar task some time back and tried to document the syntax in a easy-to-reuse way.
 
http://www.yichunhuang.com/radiance_pic/rgbe.html
 
at the bottom of the page, I've included a draft java file that eventually allowed me to access pixel values easily. (Did not have time to update with latest files...) Hope this is useful.

Hi Lucio,
 
For a convincing quantitative (also some qualitative) comparison between raytracing (Radiance) and radiosity (Lightscape), the following may be useful:
 
 
Kopylov, E. A., A. B. Khodulev, and V. L. Volevich (1998). Physically Accurate Lighting Simulation in Computer Graphics Software. Moscow, Moscow State University, Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics, Russian Academy of Sciences
 
The only caveat is that this study seems (i did not verify) to be funded by INTEGRA (Specter, the Japanese raytrace system) and does not seem to be published in any peer-reviewed system I am familiar with. I can't remember where I found that paper (in fact the citation might be inaccurate) but an earlier version (excluding the 3rd author) is available at http://www.keldysh.ru/pages/cgraph/articles/pals/index.htm
 
A. Khodulev and E. Kopylov, "Physically accurate lighting simulation in computer graphics software," presented at the Sixth International Conference on Computer Graphics and Visualization, St. Petersburg, Russia, 1-5 July 1996
 
Hope this is helpful.

I was running test renders to determine some electric lighting levels at a back wall: I had run ies2rad for the fixtures and associated the distribution to simple flat geometry to the same plane as the ceiling. When I render I don't 'see' the lights so I ran objline and objpict to check that the geometry of fixtures are there
and get the following errors:

Hello!

I know that radiance do interpolate data files linearly. 

Is it possible to let it interpolete them in other ways?

Same about light distribution data files.. beeing in the end data files, I assume they are linerly interpolated as well, are they? Is it possible to change their interpolation as well ?

ies2rad does that for you. You don't have to add 'geometry'
to make the light appear.

Bad move. Try to keep at least a tiny distance to the ceiling.
Actually, ies2rad creates the light sources a few mm below the
origin of the light distribution. If you place your fixture
scene file (the .rad file that's created by ies2rad) at 2.5m
the disc or rectangle will be at 2.4975m; enough for Radiance
to keep light source and ceiling apart.

> When I render I don't 'see' the lights

Did you use the -i option for ies2rad? This would use an 'illum'
type for the source which is invisible in a picture. The default
light source should be visible, though.

Do you miss the bright light source itself or is there no light
at all in your scene?

quick guess: this path is hardcoded in one of the scripts that are used
by objline or x11meta. I think these tools are fairly uncommon these  
days
when everyone just fires up rvu to get a preview.

On my system I have '/usr/local/lib/ray/lib' hardcoded in the
script 'objpict'. I use the /usr/local/ prefix so I can not say
if it's adjusted by the installer or not. Your error suggests it's
not so you could adjust the script yourself. The path is defined
in the first line after the comments.

Typically light sources from IES files are visible, as disc,
rectangle or box. You can use the '-i' option to allow a fancy
fitting geometry to appear and still have the light distribution
for the room. Also, the '-dv' option in rpict switches off the
rendering of sources as bright objects (they will appear black).

Hth,
Thomas

Hi Steve,

This is additional information to what Thomas wrote.  You can  
manually set the MDIR environment variable to the actual path on your  
system.  (Note that this variable only takes a single path directory,  
which must end with '/'.)  The objpict script does seem to be hard- 
coded, which is a mistake you can correct as Thomas suggested by  
editing the file.

Best,
-Greg

Hi Lucio,

You have the source code, so you are free to do what you like with  
it.  The linear interpolation routines are in src/rt/data.c.  You  
should be careful that whatever interpolant you use does not go  
outside the limits of the input data.  Bicubic interpolation is  
notorious for producing negative values on all-positive input data,  
something that can be problematic in a lighting simulation....

Cheers,
-Greg

Hi Thomas,


There is light in the scene but the lighting polygon is black not even lit. As you said I placed the polygons an inch blow the ceiling plane to no effect. It's important that the sources be visible for presentation purposes. 

here is the conversion syntax I used
ies2rad -df -t default -m .85 2X2TROFFER2T8.ies


and  these rpict options  without the -dv switch.

F syncfile -x 1024 -y 1024 -af ambfile -t 60 -vf views/Scene_1.vf -ps 3
-pt .08
-dp 512 -ar 309 -ms 0.072 -ds 0 -dj .5 -dt 0 -dc .5 -dr 1 -sj .7 -st .1
-aa .15 -ad 1500 -as 128 -av 0.01 0.01 0.01 -lr 8 -lw .002 -ab 7 -i -w -o
output.pic Scene_1.oct

I will redo the whole run with the -i option in ies2rad...

Thanks for the tip for objpict...

regards
Steve

I may have missed this, but what kind of light fixture is it?  If  
it's a low brightness downlight or something similar with good  
shielding, It may just be that your viewing angle to the light source  
is shallow enough that you cannot see any luminance.  Radiance will  
render the disc according to what the ies file says is appropriate  
for that angle.  It does tend to appear "all or nothing", that is, if  
you're looking straight up into the fixture the disc is all white and  
very shallow angles appear all black.  If you want to model the  
appearance of the light fixture itself, you will have to get a little  
fancier and model the geometry, include a glow material for the lamp  
brightness, and enclose the whole thing in an illum sphere and apply  
the luminance distribution to that.  This is well detailed in RwR and  
in various posts on this list.  I have little experience doing this  
without the help of front ends like Rayfront, but several people  
around here are.  For my needs, the default rendering of the light  
sources is generally adequate.

Rob,

The fixture is a recessed fluorescent with a flat translucent lens; therefore my needs are simply to show a glow for the lens on the same plane as the ceiling. I applied the ies distribution to a simple polygon. But anyways, for purposes of rigor I think I'll look for the latest edition of RwR. Can someone post the link to the best method of obtaining the book??..

Being recessed the fixture will have no uplight component. Did you
check the orientation the IES file will have in the scene? Typically
major output direction will point downwards (-z). For a downlight you
should not need any rotation, just lift (xform -t) the *.rad file to
the right height and place in your scene.

Did you create the polygon yourself? Ies2rad (without -i option!) will
do that and you don't need any further polygons. They will only  
interfere
with you're distribution. The only problem is that the polygon will have
the size of the luminous area not the of the actual fitting.

Hi Thomas,

MARK THIS SOLVED


I had created a 'glow' material and applying it to the same polygon in my ies.rad file. SO I got a render with my fixtures showing but still no illumination! I was trying to overlap or layer a glow material on a distribution's polygon. So you are right that the two might interfere. (But I can see where that might be useful to avoid  the extra step of two distinct polygon geometry for the same thing (which I have done before with erco fixtures 3d geometry)) 



BUT The simpler method of deleting the -i option in ies2rad worked...I see the fixture and the light distribution...

The next challenge is to use a single light distribution material and apply to multiple similar geometry in the scene... To isolate the problem, I've been hand editing each fixture geometry and duplicating the same ies.rad parameters to each...


thanks to all
Steve

I'm still confused about your way of using ies2rad. You'd only
want to use the '-i' option if you want to replace the crude IES
geometry with a geometry file you created before and you don't
want the geometry to interfere with the distribution. A recessed
fitting has no visible geometry except for a bright disc or rectangle
and that's already covered in the IES file.

> The next challenge is to use a single light distribution material
> and apply to multiple similar geometry in the scene...

If you want to use the same IES file a few times just use the
*.rad file that's created by ies2rad a few times in your scene.

Example:

First create the description for the light fitting:

## this is typed at the command line
$ ies2rad -m 0.8 -t default aero.ies

This will create 'aero.dat' and 'aero.rad'. 'aero.dat' is
a converted description of the light distribution. This file
never changes. The 'aero.dat' file contains the material
definition and the geometry of the luminous area. This geometry
is necessary to create light in your scene. Whenever you call
ies2rad with different options but with the same IES file as
argument it will create the same .dat file but the material
definition in the .rad file will change (brighter or darker,
more or less white).

Then position the aero.rad file in your scene as required:

## these lines are part of the scene description
!xform -t 0 0 2.4 aero.rad
!xform -t 0 2 2.4 aero.rad
!xform -t 0 4 2.4 aero.rad


This will place three fittings at 2.4m height spaces at 2m along
the y-axis. You can create simple arrays with xform in one line
but that's not as illustrative right now. All of these fittings
will have the same output and distribution.

If you want to change the maintenance factor (-m in ies2rad) or
the lamptype (-t) you have to create a second file and use that
instead of the first 'aero.rad'.

Another more advanced way is to use ies2rad as an inline command
in the scene file and use a 'pipe' to transform the geometry:

## these lines combine the two separate steps above
!ies2rad -s -m 0.80 -t default aero.ies | xform -t 0 0 2.4
!ies2rad -s -m 0.80 -t default aero.ies | xform -t 0 2 2.4
!ies2rad -s -m 0.80 -t default aero.ies | xform -t 0 4 2.4


Note the additional '-s' in the ies2rad command.

When you run these lines through oconv the 'aero.ies' file has
to be present in the directory or you will get an error. After
the conversion, there will be one 'aero.dat' file while all
the material definitions and light polygons have been passed
through xform instead of being written to a .rad file.

This method has the advantage that you don't have to create
a new 'aero.rad' file for every dimming value you want to
try. Just modify the '-m' argument:

## same fitting, different dimming values:
!ies2rad -s -m 0.80 -t default aero.ies | xform -t 0 0 2.4
!ies2rad -s -m 0.60 -t default aero.ies | xform -t 0 2 2.4
!ies2rad -s -m 0.40 -t default aero.ies | xform -t 0 4 2.4


I hope this helps to solve your problems.

Thomas

Hi,

I wanted to add a few comments on this.

The "-i <radius>" option to ies2rad creates a sphere of radius specified 
by -i. This sphere has a an illum type applied to it to produce light. 
The illum is modified by a brightfunc specifying the output distribution 
based on the converted photometry data. However there are a few things 
to note:

   1. an illum is invisible - however it gives off light, if you are
      having problems a good first test is to convert your ies data
      without the -i option so you will get a "light" material defined
      rather than an "illum" material
   2. ies2rad -i creates a sphere, you need to understand where the
      sphere is relative to other surface geometry such as a ceiling,
      you may have problems if your sphere cuts through other geometry
   3. an illum can specifiy an alternate material to show up in its
      place (however if you have a sphere defined via ies2rad where in
      fact there should be a ring then this will not look right):

        void glow my.glowing.source
        0
        0
        4 1 1 1 0

        void brightfunc my.illum.distribution
        <.....>
        0
        1 1

        my.illum.distribution illum my.illum.source
        1 my.glowing.source
        0
        3 1 1 1

I have always advocated that whenever anyone is using ies photometric 
data, one should create a simple test box to place the output of ies2rad 
into in order to quickly view what is going on. This way you can see if 
the things are behaving the way they need and/or if they need additional 
transforms to get things in the correct location/orientation.

In the case where you want to create more detailed geometry representing 
the fixture and perhaps a glowing source, then the thing to do is to 
create this geometry and use a glow for the source surface and then 
either enclose this in an illum sphere or other enclosing geometry or 
float a quad or ring in front of the glow (assuming relatively 
directional output) and again apply the illum distribution. However be 
aware of what Rob G. has pointed out that there will be some 
distributions that will "cut off" dependent on view angle.

To deploy multiple instances of a light into a scene you can use xform 
as I think Thomas has outlined. This will work when thing are generally 
evenly spaced. If you have a more irregular deployment then you need to 
take a look at "replmarks" (man replmarks), which will replace a 
triangular marker with whatever you want (light or other kind of 
instanced geometry).

I hope this helps.

I wholeheartedly agree.  I wrote a quick script (well actually it's  
just a modified copy of the objview script) to do this a few years  
ago; the link has been bused for a while now, but I just fixed it:

http://www.rumblestrip.org/downloads/ltview.tgz

ltview takes a radiance luminaire description (output from ies2rad)  
and places it centered in a 4' square box with one side missing, and  
fires up rvu (and cranks up -ds) to display the distribution.  It has  
come in handy more than once.  Here is a link to my original blog  
post announcing its availability and explaining its use:

http://www.rumblestrip.org/2004/05/10/ltview-a-radiance-utility

And be advised that it's geared to imperial units, so if you  
converted your ies file with meters in mind, you'll need to adjust  
the -bs parameter to scale your box down so it's tighter to the  
fixture.  I think Aksel had problems with this when I first released  
it; setting -bs .63 should give you a similarly sized box for a  
metric-converted fixture.

Thanks Jack, Rob 

That cleared that up for me. I understood xform array from Axel Jacobs tutorial and Thomas' example. Replmarks and ltview will prove invaluable in 'trying' out different lighting scenarios. So far I succeed I getting rvu to render and show my fixtures in sufficiently correct form, scale and presentable. Now the fun part: analysis

I used the same oct file from rvu to generate illuminance and luminance pic files. Now with ximage, the -illuminance pic I see the fixtures in black (which perhaps males sense since no light arrives at the lens right?) I did test for a room with window openings in daytime and night time:

The night illuminance pic shows the fixture lens lit and gives what seems the correct fc reading (which I must validate)
The day time illuminance pic shows the lens in black in the obviously much brighter pic (I adjusted exposure) but the ximage 'l' readings are too high for fc units but seem correct if they are lux. The key word is 'seem'. 

My variables are too numerous to list here( rpict options, ximage etc.) I need to know if an irradiance pic rendered with thr -i option in rpict can be analyzed ximage so has to give lux or footcandle readings. There is sun patch in the daytime rendered scene. would that serverly impair the accuracy of pixel readings???

regards
Steve

The link that Greg provided to Amazon.com to order  Rendering with Radiance  is correct, but due to the length of the URL and word wrap in some email software, the link may not work or it may be cumbersome to finesse into a working URL.

The TinyURL shortcut is:  http://tinyurl.com/2wn78b

The book can be delivered in as soon as 3 days.  The cost is $80.00US plus shipping and handling.

Happy Rendering!

Hi Steve,

By default, your luminance pics are in cd/m^2, and your illuminance pics 
are in lux.  The accuracy of the rendering would not necessarily affect 
the accuracy of the scene; if anything, sun patches would improve the 
accuracy of the results for a given set of settings.  I wouldn't worry 
about the appearance of an illuminance image, if the values are 
correct.  I recommend you use the falsecolor tool to generate some 
falsecolor images of your scene, so you can do a thorough investigation 
of the whole image's values.  And of course for absolute accuracy of a 
validation you should use rtrace and calculate values at specific points 
that you can verify with hand calcs.  This will be more accurate than 
interpolating a glob of colors in a falsecolor image, or even picking 
points off the image in ximage. 

Also, have you tried rad yet?  rad can make very intelligent guesses 
about appropriate settings for rpict, based on your simple inputs of 
scene size (max dimension), image QUALITY (high-medium-low), VARIABILITY 
or range of light in the space (high-medium-low), and DETAIL or model 
complexity (high-medium-low).  This is a great tool and you can even use 
it and just output the settings to a text file to inspect.  You can 
learn about the variables that way, by changing one of the parameters 
above and see the ramifications on the rpict/rtrace settings.  The use 
of rad is covered well in RwR, as is the practice of performing 
sensitivity studies on your models and parameters, to find a sweet spot 
in terms of accuracy/time.  This dance is done on every project, but 
eventually you will develop a feel for setting these parameters, at 
least roughly.
