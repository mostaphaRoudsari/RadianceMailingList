Hi Jack!

Yes, I had just misunderstood the -x -y parameters of pcompos. The
pvalue-part was clear to me.

I guess that this is what I will do. While I still think that it could
be done using only pcompos, imagemagick is easier here. I wanted to draw
markers such as rectangular frames around known areas, e.g. mark the
area in an image that has been read out by pvalue.

Thank you! Lars.

This may be simple... because it seems like it should be, but I'm quite hung
up on how to do this. How would I go about modeling an upside-down bowl? (Or
an upper hemisphere, or a rounded lampshade, whatever helps you picture it
best). It seems like "genrev" would be the way to do this, but I don't quite
understand what z(t) and r(t) do. If the input for a 2 foot wide hemisphere
(surface normals inward) isn't too complicated, perhaps someone could paste
it here and I could backwards-determine what the functions represent.

Here's another question: can we simply make a "bubble" and cut it in half?
(discarding half of it, of course)

Thanks!

Nick,

Use gensurf rather than genrev.  This command generates the bottom  
half of a unit sphere centred on the origin (e.g. a hemispherical  
'bowl'):

!gensurf mat hemi 'sin(PI*s)*cos(PI*t)' 'cos(PI*s)' '- 
sin(PI*s)*sin(PI*t)' 20 20 -s

Remove the -ve sign in the z expression to get the top half.  The -s  
argument applies smoothing to the surface normal.

Hi John,

Is there some reason to prefer gensurf to genrev in this instance?   
Genrev should produce a smaller (simpler) model, and allows for  
smoothing as well.  The following makes a pretty convincing hemisphere:

	genrev mat hemi 'cos(PI/2*t)' 'sin(PI/2*t)' 20 -s

using 20 primitives rather than 400.    Since the first function z(t)  
is decreasing with increasing t, the surface normal points inwards as  
requested.

It's also possible to use an antimatter volume to hide the bottom  
half of the sphere, and this is recommended if a perfect hemisphere  
is required.  However, there are drawbacks to this method, such as  
being unable to render from inside the excluded volume.  Here's an  
example of how this could be done:

sphere_mat bubble my_sphere
0
0
4 0 0 0 1

void antimatter anti_sphere_mat
2 void sphere_mat
0
0

!genbox anti_sphere_mat anti_vol 2 2 1 | xform -t -1 -1 -1

Best,
-Greg

Yeah, I was slavishly following your gensurf manpage example:
To generate a tesselated sphere:
gensurf crystal ball 'sin(PI*s)*cos(2*PI*t)' 'cos(PI*s)'  
'sin(PI*s)*sin(2*PI*t)' 7 10
That and I'm much less frugal nowadays when it comes to counting  
polygons.

Hi John,

Your suggestion does carry the advantage of producing correct  
smoothed normals on both sides of the surface, whereas the normal  
perturbations out of genrev are only correct for the "front" side of  
the object (the inside in this case).

Cheers,
-Greg

Subject: [Radiance-general] Cumulative calculations of irradiance
Message-ID: <4847B368.4050405@pobox.com>

Hello group,

I am working out some simulations to get some figures that help me 
estimate irradiance on a building for thermal load comparison. What I am 
trying to do is to gauge the range of numbers one can get and the 
differences in different part of the building so I have a basis to speak 
to the engineer.

To do this I generate my Radiance model with only one material to start 
with with 50% reflectance. I generate a 1/2 hour series of renderings 
(with -i switch on).
Afterwards I add up the irradiances with pcomb to get one picture from 
which to get the falsecolor scale in kWh / m2.

I'm using falsecolor with -m = 0.001 to get the output in kWh / m2 to 
get daily cumulative irradiances. Is this approach correct?

I'm doing this because RADMAP for windows fails to work (even the 
example files that come with it) so I wanted to play around with 
radiance and learn something on the way.


I guess my next step is to feed real irradiance data into radiance and 
foloow the procedure outlined before, Am I in the proper direction?

Thanks for any feedback!

Iv?n Pajares

Hi Lars,

The "-o" option of pvalue would usually do the trick, but pcompos  
gobbles up the EXPOSURE= lines in the input, not passing them to  
subsequent programs.  This is why the exposure needs to be "undone"  
before passing the picture through pcompos.

The reason pcompos behaves thus is that it's designed to take  
multiple input images and the combined result won't necessarily have  
the same exposure.  I should have some more intelligent code in there  
for combining the exposure values in case they're all the same, I  
suppose....

Hi Iv?n,

Regarding your calculation of kWh / m2, you should probably use -m  
0.0005 if you are adding up values every half hour rather than once  
per hour.

As for the -i option not doing quite what you want, glass and other  
transparent surfaces are excepted for this calculation and pass  
through to whatever lies beyond.  Under circumstances where you are  
after a rendering of visible surfaces, this is usually preferred.  To  
get the irradiance on every surface regardless of type, use:

	vwrays -x xres -y yres [view options] -fd \
		| rtrace -fd -h -opN scene.oct \
		| rtrace -fdc -I `vwrays -d -x xres -y yres [view options]`scene.oct \
		> irradiance.pic

Vwrays produces the view rays, which the first rtrace very quickly  
turns into intersection points and surface normals.  These are then  
passed to the second rtrace as irradiance measurement points.  The  
second invocation of vwrays in backwards quotes is simply there to  
tell the second rtrace the image dimensions.

I hope this helps.

Hi everyone,

 

I'm new to Radiance and walking through the "Scene 0" tutorial from
Chapter 1 in the book (also
http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/tutorial.html). I only get up to
adding the box for the room before hitting my first error - rebuilding
the octree with the !genbox line gives this error:

 

invalid command line argument:

gray_paint

 

I have the gray_paint material defined above in the rad file and
double-check everything. What's going on?

 

Thanks,

The "script" program doesn't work with "vi".  How about sending me  
the Radiance input file that's generating the error, instead?

Thank you for your help Greg. Let me add another question:

the vwrays lines you sent uses inline commands which I cannot mimic in 
windows shell, can someone pont me to some source on how to place 
'inline' commands in windows shell commands? (using F Anselmo's Mingw 
Radiance binaries)

Thanks again.

Hi Cramer,

I just noticed in your typescript file that the problem is you have a  
different program also called "genbox" that is being called (from  
Gromacs) instead of the Radiance tool.  The easiest fix is to run  
"which genbox" to find the path to the other one, then change your  
PATH order for your shell initialization file to point to the  
Radiance executable directory before the other one.

I hope this sorts out your problem.

Hi Ivan,

When combining irradiance pics you may wish to set the pixel jitter to  
zero (i.e. -pj 0), and render at the final resolution. This will  
prevent different surfaces from possibly contributing to the summed  
irradiance for those pixels that delineate the 'line' between one  
surface and another.  The consequence is more prominent jaggies, but I  
prefer that to 'halos'.

Subject: [Radiance-general] lighting simulation of blinds in Energy Plus vs.
	Radiance
Message-ID: <393151.66932.qm@web35105.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hello, All,
&nbsp;
We are doing research on blinds that we call ?split controlled blinds?.
Basically, we divided a window in three sections in a vertical direction. 
In each window section we use the same type of the blinds but the slats have different tilt angles in each section (for example, 0 degrees in the upper part (completely open) , 15 degrees in the middle part and then 90 degrees in the lower part (completely closed).
&nbsp;
We plan to do both energy and lighting simulations for these blinds. For the energy simulations we use Energy Plus.
Energy Plus also performs lighting simulations. &nbsp;I wanted to ask for your opinion about accuracy/validation of Energy Plus when it comes to lighting simulation.
I have read that Energy Plus has integrated DElight software (radiosity based lighting simulation software) and that measurements are within 10% error? Is this margin of error acceptable?
&nbsp;
Our building is very simple (10?x15? in the plan), and it has a 6'X6' window on a 10' X 11' wall. We expected sufficient
levels of illuminance &nbsp;for this room but we got low illuminance value of 270 lux at the workplane close to the window. 
I am concerned is that either Energy Plus is not accurate enough or we have some error in our input.
&nbsp;
How would you compare Radiance and Energy Plus (or DElight) when it comes to simulation of blinds?
&nbsp;
We are new to Radiance and work already in Energy Plus, so we want to see if we can use Energy Plus for lighting simulation instead of Radiance. 
Or Radiance is still the most accurate tool for lighting simulations? 
&nbsp;
Thank you.
Svetlana

Depends on what you're trying to accomplish, but 10% error is  
perfectly acceptable for most architectural/lighting design  
simulation problems.  But to simply say that the program is within  
10% without stating assumptions regarding the various simulation  
parameters (which affect accuracy) is a gross misrepresentation (and,  
sadly, a common one with software manufacturer claims).

What time of day?  What sky condition?  Hoe close is "close to the  
window"?  Lots of questions...

Using a light-backwards ray tracing algorithm to solve light  
transport through blinds is a tough problem.  Radiance includes a  
tool called mkillum that can do an initial raytrace at the blind  
interface and convert that result into a direct distribution for the  
window/blind system.  This in turn is then used as a virtual light  
source to calculate the illuminance in the space.  It leads to faster  
and more accurate results in Radiance.  I cannot speak to Energy  
Plus' lighting calculation capabilities, but my experience with DOE-2  
is that building energy simulation programs are severely limited in  
their ability to accurately estimate annual daylight and electric  
light performance.  It is possible to precalculate the daylighting  
performance in Radiance and convert that to some sort of lighting  
schedule that can be plugged into the E+ model to at least get a  
single picture from E+ for the building's performance.

Greg,

That was it. I took me a minute to figure out how to find and edit the
initialization file (editing /home/[username]/.bashrc as root), but it
works now. Thanks!

Radiance executable directory before the other one.

I hope this sorts out your problem.

Hello Svetlana,

Naturally, asking on the Radiance mailing list, you're going to hear  
people say Radiance is the most accurate.  In your case, I would say  
the 10% error is going to be overshadowed (no pun intended) by the  
variability of daylight.  Specifically, it is very important to  
consider the weather data used as your basis in determining exterior  
daylight conditions.  Even getting within 10% of measured  
illuminances requires the use of measured sky distributions, which  
are almost never available.  So, I'd say this accuracy is based on  
the assumption that your sky matches the standard CIE model, which of  
course it won't if it's a real sky.  Radiance would fare no better.

Annual simulation requires quick calculations, which is not really  
Radiance's strength.  I know that Rob Hitchcock (the author of  
DElight) has put a lot of energy into his fenestration calculations,  
so if you aren't getting the output you expect, I'd take a closer  
look at the input as a first step.

Cheers,
-Greg

Hello Greg and Rob,
&nbsp;
Thank you both for a quick response.
&nbsp;
Rob Hitchcock's claims 10% error in his paper&nbsp;about DELight2 (DELIGHT2 DAYLIGHTING ANALYSIS IN ENERGY PLUS: INTEGRATION AND PRELIMINARY USER RESULTS).
&nbsp;
Hitchcock stated that:
"Delight participated in validation exercise specifically focused on the ability to simulate
CFS performance, as characterized by measured BTDFs (Maamari, et al., 2005). The comparisons were based on measurements and corresponding simulations in a simple-geometry test box for combinations of CFS BTDFs and measured skies. The DElight2 results for a particular combination of a CIE overcast sky and a measured BTDF representing Serraglaze were shown."
&nbsp;
This is all they mentioned about a sky model and the error. We used TMY 3 weather file downloaded from the Energy Plus website and did not add anything specifically related to the sky model in our input.
&nbsp;
I wonder if this information from Hitchcock's paper&nbsp;warranties accuracy of the results.
&nbsp;
We have not done experimental testing of our system and can rely only on the computer simulations at this moment....so we want to make sure we are on the right track when selecting a software for lighting simulations.
&nbsp;
Thank you very much.
&nbsp;
Svetlana

&gt; Hello, All,
&gt;
&gt; We are doing research on blinds that we call ?split controlled  
&gt; blinds?.
&gt;
&gt; Basically, we divided a window in three sections in a vertical  
&gt; direction.
&gt;
&gt; In each window section we use the same type of the blinds but the  
&gt; slats have different tilt angles in each section (for example, 0  
&gt; degrees in the upper part (completely open) , 15 degrees in the  
&gt; middle part and then 90 degrees in the lower part (completely closed).
&gt;
&gt; We plan to do both energy and lighting simulations for these  
&gt; blinds. For the energy simulations we use Energy Plus.
&gt;
&gt; Energy Plus also performs lighting simulations.  I wanted to ask  
&gt; for your opinion about accuracy/validation of Energy Plus when it  
&gt; comes to lighting simulation.
&gt;
&gt; I have read that Energy Plus has integrated DElight software  
&gt; (radiosity based lighting simulation software) and that  
&gt; measurements are within 10% error? Is this margin of error acceptable?
&gt;
&gt; Our building is very simple (10?x15? in the plan), and it has a  
&gt; 6'X6' window on a 10' X 11' wall. We expected sufficient
&gt; levels of illuminance  for this room but we got low illuminance  
&gt; value of 270 lux at the workplane close to the window.
&gt;
&gt; I am concerned is that either Energy Plus is not accurate enough or  
&gt; we have some error in our input.
&gt;
&gt; How would you compare Radiance and Energy Plus (or DElight) when it  
&gt; comes to simulation of blinds?
&gt;
&gt; We are new to Radiance and work already in Energy Plus, so we want  
&gt; to see if we can use Energy Plus for lighting simulation instead of  
&gt; Radiance.
&gt;
&gt; Or Radiance is still the most accurate tool for lighting simulations?
&gt;
&gt; Thank you.
&gt;
&gt; Svetlana

Hi Ivan,
 
One approach we have taken for cumulative irradiance studies is to add
up the sky sources first and then do a single simulation with multiple
skies.  There is a script that Francesco Anselmo developed (I can't
recall the name or where it might be at the moment) that creates an
annual sky based on a tmy2 weather file.  Not sure of your exact needs,
but this might be an easier way to go about it.

Hello group,

I am working out some simulations to get some figures that help me 
estimate irradiance on a building for thermal load comparison. What I
am 
trying to do is to gauge the range of numbers one can get and the 
differences in different part of the building so I have a basis to
speak 
to the engineer.

To do this I generate my Radiance model with only one material to start

with with 50% reflectance. I generate a 1/2 hour series of renderings 
(with -i switch on).
Afterwards I add up the irradiances with pcomb to get one picture from

which to get the falsecolor scale in kWh / m2.

I'm using falsecolor with -m = 0.001 to get the output in kWh / m2 to 
get daily cumulative irradiances. Is this approach correct?

I'm doing this because RADMAP for windows fails to work (even the 
example files that come with it) so I wanted to play around with 
radiance and learn something on the way.


I guess my next step is to feed real irradiance data into radiance and

foloow the procedure outlined before, Am I in the proper direction?

Thanks for any feedback!

Iv?n Pajares

I've been trying to work out a similar solution for generating a  
composite image of hourly irradiance values over a full year.    
However, rather than cumulative results, as produced with pcomb, I  
want each pixel in the final image to only represent the highest value  
of irradiance that occurs at that pixel location over a years worth of  
hourly runs.  Ex: if a given pixel gets the highest level of  
irradiance on June 21 @ noon then that will be the value given to that  
pixel in the final image.  Has anyone tackled this before? Thanks.

Hi Chris,

I haven't done this, but you should be able to compute the maximum  
values between two images using pcomb like so:

	pcomb -h -e 'max(a,b):if(a-b,a,b)' -e 'lo=max(li(1),li(2))' -o  
last_max.pic -o new_vals.pic > cur_max.pic

Renaming cur_max.pic to last_max.pic (using mv -f cur_max.pic  
last_max.pic) before each invocation should maintain the maximum  
values at each pixel over each new addition of new_vals.pic.  (The -h  
option is to avoid endless growth of the picture header.)

I hope this helps.
-Greg

Jogn Mardaljevis has developed an annual sky model based on climate data:
http://www.thedaylightsite.com/filebank/Climate%20Based%20Daylight%20Modelling.pdf

I've had the good fortune to have been able to work with it ( cheers John! )
and it is such a wonderful model.
Surely a huge contribution to daylight design!

Hi Greg,

Thanks for the quick response.  I've been trying the pcomb line as you  
have suggested but the resultant image still seems to show the  
cumulative values?  I seem to get the same results just using:
     pcomb *.raw > annual.pic

Thanks again.

Hi Zack,

I have tried creating a let's call it 'accumulated' sky (rendering 
multiple skies as a big cube, adding them with pcomb and then 
re-rendering with them as a light probe). However as I'm trying to 
include the direct component I generate the skies seperately without sun 
and the the suns on another file to render. This is leading to 
extraordinarily big numbers so I guess I have to, and please correct my 
mathematical language if wrong, normalize the numbers to get a 
manageable figure to work with, is this right?

I know I might be repeating what F. Anselmo and R. Compagnon have done 
with radmap and other scripts but I confess I enjoy learning this things 
'the hard way'...

So, to sum up:

Is it better to render the direct sun component on separate file to get 
all the sun's dayli/montly or yearly positions and render with all those 
direct sources plus the accumulated skies or to accumulate the skies 
with the sun and render?

Thanks to everybody for the feedback, it is outstanding the knowledge 
that flows through these emails...

If I understand the question correctly, It's more efficient to render  
using a 'sky' file that contains both the cumulative sun (e.g. many  
suns) and the cumulative sky [1] contribution since the inter- 
reflection calculation will determine the indirect sun component as  
well and the direct + indirect sky components.

John-

How would I do this with brightdata?  I use a modified version of  
Francsco's radmap to produce the aggregated image for these types of  
analyses, but I'm interested in learning how to apply a brightdata  
method instead.  Is this faster?  What is the input?

Francesco's radmap has worked well for us (that would be Zack &  
myself), creating a single annual sky file (or monthly, or seasonal,  
depending on how much TMY2 data you feed the script) that contains a  
single, summed hemispherical sky describing the total radiance for  
the period, plus all the suns . Your lightprobe idea sounds  
interesting, too.  I would like to update radmap to use gendaylit to  
create the sky descriptions for greater accuracy, but the current  
version works well for us for now.

I generate the sky luminance pattern for each entry in the TMY file  
and then read-off the luminance values for points on a pre-determined  
grid.  I just keep adding to the values and then write them out in  
brightdata format (much like was done for the measured sky luminance  
patterns).  I settled on this scheme since it followed on from the  
validation.  I doubt that it is faster, or significantly so, than the  
aggregated image method.

The cumulative sun contribution is provided by a pre-determined grid  
of standard Radiance suns, where each sun contains the aggregated  
effect of all the nearby sun positions that occur throughout the  
year.  Just 150-200 or so suns provides a spatial distribution that is  
equivalent to a time-step of around 1/2 hour.  So, much better than  
creating a rad file with potentially several thousand suns (for a  
cumulative annual file).

Unfortunately, it's not code that I can share since it is part of an  
unwieldy mass of IDL procedures and scripts that only ever gets used  
in-house and is probably not fit to be let out of the door.

Message-ID: <cdf76d820806111324x5edda96fpae108bf176ccb2fa@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I am using DAYSIM, not radiance directly.

When the simulation begins to run, there are these two different types of
warnings:

oconv: warning - non-planar verterx for polygon "f_1719_0" (this happens for
20 or so polygons)
rtrace_dc: warning - non-planar vertex for polygon "F_1636 (Can't see the
rest of it, this happens for probably the same polygons but not in the same
order)

I used the SketchUp to Radiance su2rad plugin to export geometry from a
sketchup model and I had to start the simulation before DAYSIM refreshed
geometry display since it was taking too long to do that.

How serious are these warnings and why are they occuring?

Thanks,

Subject: [Radiance-general] Modeling Question for Translucent Glass
Message-ID: <485153d6.21c07e0a.50ab.ffffff55@mx.google.com>

Hi,
 
I am fairly new to Radiance and was trying to model a interior translucent
glazing (possibly a ceramic frit). I have looked up the archive posts for
help but need a little bit more guidance on the modeling of the glazing. I
am modeling the white translucent glazing with about 50% transmittance using
the following parameters:
 
void trans translucent panel
0
0
7 1 1 1 0 0 0.5 0.2
 
I would like to know if I am correct in my assumptions. 
 
The second issue which I have not been able to figure out is how to show
this trans material inside the space in the final rendering in Radiance as
it is essentially invisible.
 
Any help on this will be appreciated.
 
Regards,
Nik

The export of polygons from Sketchup has only a limited accuracy.  
This results in some
cases in polygons where one of the points is outside of the plane  
defined by the rest
of the vertices. Radiance has a built in tolerance for these points  
but when that's exceeded
the warning is generated and the vertex or the whole polygon ignored  
in the rendering.
I'm not sure about the last part but maybe someone else knows better.

Relevance: If the polygon is ignored and it is essential for the  
geometry (ie a wall of a room)
then it is relevant. If it's just a tiny piece that doesn't do much  
for the lighting it's harmless.

To avoid this problem export with the option 'triangulate'. This  
creates polygons with
only 3 vertices. Much more polygons in the scene but no warnings.

Regards,
Thomas

The warnings don't indicate any action, and are only given by  
Radiance because cracks may appear between polygons due to the  
determination of an "average plane" that doesn't pass exactly through  
every point.

One obvious error is the name 'translucent panel'. Identifiers can  
not contain
spaces so it should be 'translucent_panel' or something like that.

The '1 1 1' looks odd to me. I don't think that's actually a physical  
material.
I'd go for something like 0.8 for white.

Think about it:
if it's 50% translucent it has to be visible (even glass with 50%  
transmission would
show as a darker shade of the room behind it.) You're talking about  
'white' so I assume
that you do want some amount of scattering of the light. In fact, the  
material above
scatters 80% of the light that passes, so it would definitely be  
visible.

Just try a simple scene with a test cube and a bit of ground below  
and use
the command 'objview' (Unix only) to see how the material works out.

Thomas

Nik, Is it invisible in any rendering, or only if you render an

'white' so I assume
that you do want some amount of scattering of the light. In fact, the
material above
scatters 80% of the light that passes, so it would definitely be
visible.  

Just try a simple scene with a test cube and a bit of ground below and
use
the command 'objview' (Unix only) to see how the material works out.

Thomas

Hi Nikhil,

As Thomas said in his response, the material should show up in a  
normal rendering.  The best way to model frit glass is to use the  
"glaze.csh" script that I created with funding from Visarc.  For a  
single-pane glazing using a full covering of V-175 white frit, this  
script produces:

############################################
# Glazing produced by Radiance glaze script
# $Revision: 2.7 $
# Material surface normal points to interior
# Number of panes in system: 1
# Exterior surface s1 type: clear glass
# Interior surface s2 type: V-175 white frit
# s2 coating coverage: 1
# Exterior normal hemispherical reflectance: 0.33
# Interior normal hemispherical reflectance: 0.59
# Normal hemispherical transmittance: 0.21
#

Try this for now, or run the script yourself to vary the parameters.   
If you can't run the script because you only have a Windows machine,  
then you may be stuck playing around with the "trans" material.

I really appreciate the responses from all you folks.

Chris the trans panel was invisible in the illuminance run and showed up in
the Luminance run. Thanks for pointing that out.

Dear all,

I am new not only for radiance but also for Ubuntu.

I tried to install radiance on ubuntu8.03 as following steps,

(i) downloaded and installed the ubuntu8.03, and I think it should work well.

(ii) download the "rad3R9_linux.tar.gz" from
http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/framed.html and copy to
/home/myname/rad3R9_linux.tar.gz

(iii) in the ubuntu8.03, use "su" to "root", and decoppress the
rad3R9_linux.tar.gz with "tar -xzvf rad3R9_linux.tar.gz", then generate a new
folder "rad3R9_linux" in /home/myname/, and there are a lot of files in that
new folder.

(iv) exit root, use "cd  " to /home/myname/rad3R9_linux,then su to root, and
according to the readme file, use ./makeall install, but it always didn't work
and tell me"./makeall command not found"

could anyone give me a hand?

thank you in advance.

Ragards,
ZZ

Hello,

I would suggest to use 'radiance' and 'radiance-materials' packages from
ubuntu repository.
On Ubuntu, use this command: sudo apt-get install radiance
radiance-materials

Hope this will help :

Hello,

The packages will be installed into the directory specified by packages
itself. I suppose they'll be somewhere in a /usr/bin, /usr/local/bin or
/opt/radiance. Not in your home directory anyway!

I'm unsure if the RAYPATH env. variable will be set automatically.

You may download the package I compiled for Ubuntu 7.10 myself:
http://www.bakharev.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=27&Itemid=38

The files will be installed into /usr/bin and /usr/lib. Also it sets all
the env. variables needed for Radiance to work.

Best Regards,
Ilya

The location where you perform this command does not matter. You just
need the rights to do it, hence the use of sudo.

It's Debian/Ubuntu policy to install everything in the /usr branch of  
the file system.
The binaries will be in /usr/bin/, library files in /usr/lib or a  
subdirectory of it.
The advantage is that everything is in your search path after  
installation
so you won't have to adjust PATH yourself.

The disadvantage is that there will be name conflicts with other  
packages.
For the Debian/Ubuntu packages in particular the name of the 'genbox'
program was changed to 'rgenbox'. If you want to follow the examples in
old documents you have to keep that in mind and change the commands
accordingly.

Another frequently used command is 'rview'. It was renamed to 'rvu' a  
while
ago but there are still plenty of examples and tutorials around which  
use the
old name.

> (iii) should I set environment path after installion?

As said above you won't have to set PATH if everything is in /usr/bin/.
You can check if there is a RAYPATH variable set after you log in.
Type

	env | grep RAYPATH

and you should see the value of the variable (or nothing if it's not  
set).
Strictly speaking RAYPATH is not necessary if you're not referring to
any patterns or calculation files in your scene. Some example scene
do, however, so it's probably a good idea to have it set.

> (iv) how to get first start of radiance in ubuntu?

First you have to get an idea about what Radiance is. I'd recommend
to read and follow the documents linked on this page:

	http://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/learnix/docs.shtml

This should give you a good understanding of the basic interaction  
between
the Radiance tools. Further you can download a lot of e-papers from

	http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/framer.html

Some of these documents are a bit dated but the principles have not  
changed.

That should keep you busy for a while.

Regards,
Thomas

Hi,

I realize you received several replies on this. But just a note for
everyone.The error that you received when trying to run makeall install,
eg "command not found," indicates that you do not have cshell (csh)
installed. This is the shell that makeall requires. If you type "csh" at
the command line, you should get a message that explains how to get csh
using apt-get.

Regards,

-Jack de Valpine

(The previous message doesn't seem to show up properly, and is therefore re-sent here without the attachment. Sorry for the duplication.)
   
  Dear all, 
   
  I am trying to obtain irradiance value on the surfaces of building blocks under daylight but encounter the following problems.  Could you shed some light on how they can be solved?
   
  1. Uneven distribution of the uniform sky 
   
  I produced a uniform sky using the ?u option under the gensky function.  As measured from the fisheye view of the sky (both angular and hemispheric), however, the radiance of the sky slightly decreases towards the edge of the ?circle?.  Is there a way to improve this situation?  Here are the parameters that I used for rendering the sky:
   
  > Rpict ?vf view.vf ?ab 0 ?aa 0 ?ar 128 ?ad 4096 ? as 1024 sky.oct
   
  2.  Different value obtain in each run
   
  I tried to render some building blocks (with homogeneous color and reflectance) and then obtain the irradiance of a point on the ground with rtrace.  Different values returns even if the inputs are identical.  The discrepancy can be as much as 4%.  Like the command line printed above, ambience parameters had been set at their maximum values.  Is there a way to obtain irradiance values with a smaller margin of error?
   
  Thank you very much for your help!

What I believe you are seeing is the gradual transition at the horizon  
between the sky and ground radiance produced by a (steep) power-law  
blending function in skybright.cal.  This introduces a slight  
deviation from the mathematically 'perfect' distribution which might  
be noticed in certain situations.  You can prevent this happening by  
using a slightly modified version of cal file available here:

http://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm/pickup/skybright_nomix.cal

Simply place where it will be found by RAYPATH and rename  
'skybright.cal' in the gensky output to 'skybright_nomix.cal'.  This  
will work for all sky luminance distributions.  If uniform is the only  
'perfect' sky that you need, then the easiest way is create it manually:

# uniform brightness sky (B=1)
void glow sky_glow
0
0
4 1 1 1 0

sky_glow source sky
0
0
4 0 0 1 180

Re: Q2 - Have a look at the "ambient accuracy parameter" thread in  
December 2006 (especially Greg's comment).

Regards,

-John

PS. The current skybright.cal (2.7) is a later version than the one I  
modified (2.6), but I didn't note any difference in the code other  
than the RCS header.

Dear Kam,

As John Mardaljevic points out, the change at the edges of the sky is  
due to the "mixing function" designed to reduce variance at the  
horizon between the sky and the ground.  You can also avoid its  
appearance without modifying skyfunc.cal by setting -g 1.0 in gensky,  
I believe.

As for the repeatability of the results, John's reference is a good one:

	http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006- 
December/004147.html

I'm grateful to him for digging this up -- I would have tried to  
answer it all over again...

Best,
-Greg

P.S.  It is better not to send attachments to the list.

Hi.

running

dpkg -L radiance

will list the files.
You should also install the following packages:
radiance-doc
radiance-materials
- especially if you want to have a look at the examples. They're split
into packages on their own as they're architecture independent. Listing
the files works in the same way, just use the different package name.

The manpages have been patched, so they'll show genrbox.

The commands are available under the old name if you add
/usr/lib/radiance/ to your PATH. Adding something like
export PATH=/usr/lib/radiance:$PATH
to your .bashrc or /etc/profile or to the rc file of your favourite
shell will help. Then you'll also be able to use rview.

The example scenes don't need it, you need to install the
radiance-materials
package, though. If RAYPATH is not in the environment,
/usr/share/radiance will be used automatically.


There's a README which explains these details in
/usr/share/doc/radiance, in case you'd like to have additional details
added, please send me a patch or an updated file.


Hope that helps,


Bernd

Subject: [Radiance-general] sun positions as calculated by gensky
Message-ID: <1213775211.5837.50.camel@Optiplex755>

Hi list...

I just compared the sun positions as given by gensky for Singapore with
those calculated online using a form found under

http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/AltAz.php

I use the following parameters:

SINGAPORE
E 103deg48', N 1deg17'
Altitude and Azimuth of the Sun
Jun 21, 2008
Zone:  8h East of Greenwich

gives me for 1.30pm
            altitude   azimuth (north->east)
13:30       67.1       346.1

Running gensky like:

gensky 6 21 5.30GMT +s -a 1.25 -o -103.75

results in a command line:

# gensky 6 21 5.30GMT +s -a 1.25 -o -103.75
# Local solar time: 12.19
# Solar altitude and azimuth: 67.6 173.0
# Ground ambient level: 16.1

Where azimuth is given (welcome to radiance world ;-) given in south to west direction.

So I have a difference of .5 degree for elevation and 6.9 degrees for azimuth.

Do I get something wrong here about time zone calculation?

TIA&CU, Lars.

Lars,

 From the gensky manpage:
-m mer The site standard meridian is mer degrees west of Greenwich.  
(Use negative angle for east.) This is used in the calculation of  
solar time. Be sure to give the correct longitude also! If a time zone  
or solar time is given directly, then this option has no effect.
So it looks like solar time is not determined when you specify a time  
zone, e.g. GMT.  I never use the time zone settings myself, preferring  
to use the site meridian.  For your example:
gensky 6 21 13:30 +s -a 1.25 -o -103.75 -m -120
giving:
# Solar altitude and azimuth: 67.1 166.0
Which is much closer to where the Navy would have the sun (probably  
very nearly identical with the difference due to rounding).

You are entering the time with a decimal point, so it is in fact 6h
18min...!
I tried the following and I think it works (just like John was saying):

# gensky 6 21 5:30GMT +s -a 1.25 -o -103.75
# Local solar time: 12.39
# Solar altitude and azimuth: 67.1 166.0

Duh!  Thanks for spotting that Santiago.  Mind you, I'm still a little  
flummoxed: a difference of 12mins would give (I believe) a  
displacement in azimuth of, at most, 3deg. So, why is it 6deg?

Now I am getting curious :-)

By the way, is there a chance to add some timezones to gensky?
Singapore's is not covered yet.

It harks from the bad old days of working on theoretical/speculative  
projects to demonstrate new approaches.  Description here:
http://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm/pdfs/p504_slides.pdf

It turns out that the actual roof of Changi airport looks very  
different from the CAD rendering on which I (very loosely) based my  
parametric model.

Dear all,

my operating system is Ubuntu8.04, and install radiance use
apt-get install radiance and apt-get install radiance-materials
I think the installed radiance should be 3.8version.
Most radiance commands work well, but I can't find "gendaylit"? and the
feedback information in command shell is"sh: no gendaylit found", then I
search the "gendaylit" in the "usr" folder, find nothing. could anybody tell
why that?

thank you in advance,

What are we talking about here, the source distribution?  From the link 
you provided it is not clear.  I'm ASSuming you are talking about the 
latest release or HEAD release of the source code, in which case there 
are no executables in there.  The source code needs to be compiled into 
executables on your system.  Sounds like you're using a mac, so in order 
to compile the source you need to install the developer tools (Xcode), 
which you can get from here:

http://developer.apple.com/technology/xcode.html

Then you'd run (as root) "makeall install" from the ray directory. 

Let us know how that works out.

Hi there,
Thanks for the response. Yes, I am talking about the latest release on  
the Radiance download page. I am using Linux (Fedora 8). If you could  
compare the compiled package for linux with that for Mac OS, you would  
see that there are about 80 less programs for the linux version.  
Including ximage and pvalue. Moreover, if one compiles the source  
package (for linux), using makeall install, the resulting package of  
executable files still lacks the above mentioned ones.
Any other suggestions?

Well, that's odd.  The latest radiance-HEAD source distro's makefile was 
last modified on 4/17; I compiled the HEAD on a new system here on 4/20, 
and everything compiled fine.  I don't have time right now to test the 
latest greatest HEAD on a system here, but I do see that the linux 
binary package is missing a lot of programs. Francesco Anselmo maintains 
that package, so hopefully he can weigh in here...

This might explain why a Solaris remote installation returned error messages of missing binaries.
Please notify me if the same condition applies to the Radiance3.9 i386 Solaris package. 
 
Radiance 3.9 was recently installed at the Sun Microsystems grid site which I am evaluating.

Remove the "-Ae" option in line 9 of the makefile.
This option is special to HPUX systems.

Following my discussions with Sun Microsystems and my numerous requests, Radiance3.9 has now been made available on the Sun Grid job catalog. ie. the Sun Microsystems Solaris based clusters available to qualified users. 

Sun Grid is a 'cloud computing' service available to researchers running a variety of scientific, analysis and other compute intensive applications. Applications an data are uploaded for jobruns and the output is downloaded from a GUI java web-based interface. Signing up is straightforward and Sun provides a free introductory 200cpu-hours to new registrations. 1cpu-hour normally cost $1USD with no other costs or pre-purchaseed cpu-hours.

I've used the cluster for other applications and it works very well (and needless to say, fast)

Dear all,

I have a question concerning dielectric and how to model correctly
printed stripe (fritted glass) on a surface of dielectric material.

According to the reference manual, " Ordinary dielectrics are  
surrounded by a vacuum". But in my case, the transition between the  
dielectric and the print color is different to the transition from  
dielectric to vacuum. And since I'll have the printed stripes on  
different layers, the difference is significant.

My purpose is to simulate with Radiance a laminated glass with fritted
stripes on the surface in-between the two laminated glass sheets. I  
want to check the view to the outside and the transmission of such  
fritted glass.

I already modeled the stripe as a plastic surface with a very small gap
between the two panes of glass. But I obtained wrong result because of  
the air gap between the stripe and the dielectric (glass) panes.

Any idea how to model this correctly?

What happens, if the dielectric is not completely "boxed", but parts  
of the "box" replaced by plastic material?

Thanks in advance

Hi Francesco,

Your posting arrived twice -- were you not sure that it was posted  
the first time?  You can always double-check at radiance-online,  
since the archives are always current.

The "interface" type is what you are looking for, I believe, since it  
allows you to specify the dielectric constant on either side of a  
boundary.  Modeling materials at this level of detail requires that  
you know very precise things about the geometry and physical properties.

It is OK to have some sides of a dielectric capped by an opaque  
material, such as plastic.  If you have no cap, just an opening, then  
the results will not be correct.

Best,

Hi group,

The manpage of normtiff says:

-d Lddyn 
Specifies  the  dynamic  range for the target output device, which is 
the ratio of the maximum and minimum usable display luminances.  The 
default value is 32, which is typical for CRT monitors.

Is this option also useful for preparing an image for print?
And if so, what is a reasonable/typical value for printers?

Regards,
Iebele

Hi Iebele,

The -d option is useful for printing, with a value of 50 or so.   
(Some printers can produce reflectances below 2%, but they are not  
well controlled in black.)

Hope this helps.

Doesn't seem to work very well; no edges, and surfaces are either dark  
or light. Is this how it's supposed to work? Or is there some platform- 
specific problem?

I'm starting to look into several development projects, and one  
question that's come up is that all-time favorite, platform  
compatibility. And I've realized that I don't actually know what  
hardware and software people are using these days. A quick sweep of  
the mailing list doesn't find answers any more, so I figure I'd ask.  
My list of likelies is the big three:
  Mac OS X (PowerPC/Intel)
  Windows (Intel)
  Linux (Intel)

Anyone using anything else? Sun, perhaps? Old SGI systems?

Hi,

> I think the installed radiance should be 3.8version.

unfortunately it's not possible to distribute gendaylit via Debian and
Ubuntu as the license is not free:

 * You may not include this software in a program or other software product
 * without supplying the source, or without informing the end-user that the
 * source is available for no extra charge.

 * Don't even think of selling this software to other people, or
 * distributing it commercially, that is strict and explicit no.
 * This software is _not_ public domain, but copyrighted as
 * noted in the copyright file.


If somebody manages to talk copyright owners into publishing it under a
proper license, I wouldn't mind to package it for debian.

Cheers,

Bernd

Hi Randolph,

I've had problems with glrad on various platforms as well, but I've  
no idea how to fix it.  I'm not much of an OpenGL programmer, and the  
compatibility issues between implementations are considerable.   
Anyone who wants to take this on, I'd be more than happy to answer  
questions about what it's supposed to be doing, etc.

A peek at Mark Stock's radiance benchmark page 
(http://mark.technolope.org/pages/rad_bench.html) shows that someone is 
using Solaris, but on AMD architecture.  Other than that, it's the usual 
suspects...  I'd bet there are still some users running on OS X on G4, too.

Yes, me e.g., and sometimes I boot my G4 in Linux. But even more use OS 
X on G5 then G4..

Randolph,
 
Not sure if you would count this as Linux (intel), but running radiance on Cygwin from within windows has been pretty handy.

gensky is the original program to generate sky descriptions
that comes with Radiance. It can be used to create CIE standard
sky situations.

gendaylit creates the sky description following the Perez
sky model. It is more suited to model different atmospheric
conditions if you know how the parameters work. You can find
the man page here:

http://caad.arch.ethz.ch/CAAD/ray/man_html/gendaylit.1.html

If you just want to do typical illuminance calcs for standard
situations you can happily stick with gensky.

Regards,
Thomas

I just tried it on 10.4.11. The geometry is shaded as I would have
expected. The movement controls via mouse are pretty much unusable,
though.

I am still on R3.8 here and I think I downloaded the binaries instead
of rolling my own.

Do you use OS X 10.4 or 10.5 (Leopard)? The graphic system changed
significantly between the two ("Core Graphics") and plain old OpenGL
might have suffered a bit.

Thanks Mark, Rob G., and Lars. I scanned the benchmark page and found  
a few SPARCs, too. Sun Studio and Sun WorkShop compilers are mentioned.

So far I have:
Mac (PPC/Intel)
Windows (Intel)
Linux (Intel)
Solaris (SPARC/Intel)

Mark, you mentioned you are using Cygwin; is there anyone using  
Windows and *not* using Cygwin? Any MS SFU or SUA users?

Randolph
