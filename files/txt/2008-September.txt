I think I can answer my own question. As the rendering 
progressed, the memory growth slowed, and it finally ended at 
6.4GB. A higher-resolution rendering is showing the same fast 
initial growth, and slow later growth, also ending near 6.4 GB

I suspect Radiance loads each of the 407 individual geometry 
chunks (octree instances?) when it is first needed. It took until 
near the end of the render to load in the last one.

Now I ask: will Radiance ever drop a chunk? If I want 24m instead 
of 12m cylinders, I'd need ~13GB. I can only presume that 
Radiance doesn't know this, and will continue to ask for more 
memory, with the OS obliging with excessive page swapping.

My options for larger scenes seem limited:
1) analyze the geometry and reduce surface overlap, or
2) buy a server with 16 GB RAM.

Hi Mark,

You are correct in your deduction that Radiance loads chunks (octrees  
in this case) as they are first required during rendering, unless you  
are using the -PP option, which causes the whole scene and all  
references to be preloaded to maximize memory sharing.

Radiance doesn't do any LRU ejection of memory once it's been  
loaded.  However, virtual memory will swap out pages that are not  
accessed and this should in general be just as good.  You only need  
to make sure you have enough free disk space to accommodate your VM  
system.

I hope this helps.
-Greg

Hi Erik,

I think the difference is due to the fact that points closer to the  
window see more of the sky directly, whose value is unaffected by the  
-av setting.  Towards the back of the room, more rays encounter  
opaque surfaces, where -av does matter.

Quick question:  Can anyone tell me how the rad program interprets the
HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW settings in the .rif file?  Does each setting have a
corresponding pre-determined list of rpict parameters, or does it take
scene geometry etc. and determine appropriate parameters each time?

Thanks,

Thanks, I didn't know about the -n option.  The man file gives a useful
overview but doesn't go into the details of the choices made.  Other
than -aa and -ar, are there any more parameters relating to scene
geometry?  I guess I'll fiddle around with different .rif file options
and scene dimensions, but I just wonder if there is a document somewhere
explaining in detail.

Jack's right, this is a great way to play "what if" with the rif file
parameters. Here is a link to a paper Greg wrote on rad that is
extremely informative about the way rad (and by extension, all of the
rendering and calculation pieces of Radiance) works:

http://www.radiance-online.org/radiance-workshop2/cd/Ward/egwr95.pdf

And from this paper, regarding the routines rad employs to make these
decisions about rendering parameters, we have this gem:

"There is very little point in describing these routines in any detail,
but pseudocode
for the medium quality procedure is included in the Appendix for those
who are
curious. What is significant is that these three short routines embody
much of the
author$B!G(Bs knowledge about Radiance rendering and what works best in a given
situation. As awkward as they may look, they are a form of expert knowledge,
and it would have been impossible to write them without years of experience
using this software. Initially, it seemed that coding this knowledge
would be
impossible, but it turned out instead to be cathartic." (Ward)

A paraphrased version of this paragraph has remained in my head since
the first time I read it (indeed, I searched the pdf for the word
"cathartic" to find the paragraph), because to me it encapsulates the
entire crux of the problem of Radiance mastery.

There an overview table on pages 517 and 558 of Rendering with Radiance
for direct and ambient settings. I'm not sure if some of the other
settings are outlined in a similar manner in other portions of the book.

I suspect that the actual values given in those tables may be simplified
or have been updated since then. For example I thought that setting
Quality=High and Variability=High will give an -ad parameter above 1024.

	illuminance
Message-ID: <1220630461.4902.1272373303@webmail.messagingengine.com>

Hi again,

I've been puzzling over an extremely bright ground plane in one of my
images.  I think I've tracked it down the the use of rpict's -i switch
for calculating irradiance rather than radiance.  Can anyone help
clarify whether I'm on the right track?

If I want a luminance image, i.e. with levels corresponding to what one
might actually see (and can compare cd/m2 values at different points) I
omit the -i switch (and calculate radiance).  If I include the -i switch
(and calculate irradiance), then I obtain illuminance (lm/m2 levels). 
In both cases the radiometric units and turned into photometric units
(using Radiance's 179lm/W conversion factor) by the image viewer
software (I'm using the Ecotect RadianceIV viewer).

Radiance is W/m2.sr while irradiance is W/m2.  Luminance is lm/m2.sr
(cd/m2) while illuminance is lm/m2 (lux).  I think this means radiance
and luminance are properties of a (solid angle) source while irradiance
and luminance are properties of a (flat) surface?

So my extremely bright ground plane is actually showing its lux level
(the amount of light falling on it, rather than the amount of light it's
reflecting).  If I want to illustrate the relative brightness of
different surfaces I guess I need to go back and calculate luminance
rather than illuminance.

I did notice that if I clicked on the bit of 'ground' beyond the ground
plane I get a much smaller value (in fact the same as the value in the
luminance image - because I'm clicking on the ground as defined in the
sky file - a glow source).  Why is this?  Does the concept of
illuminance on a direct light source not make sense?

Sorry for the long winded email equivalent of thinking out loud, and I
appreciate that my understanding of photometry is pretty sketchy.

Hi Nick,

In order to provide help on this one, it would be good to provide
information on the parameters being used as a starting point. So output
from rad -n <rif file> would be good. Another thing that might be
helpful is to get the material definition for the ground plane object.

Thanks, that's just what I was looking for!  The values for medium
quality given in the book appear different from those in Greg's paper
(based on a cursory glance through the appendix).  Can anyone confirm
the current values, otherwise I guess I can just play rad -n when I get
time.

Cheers,

If you're really curious how these options are set, there's always  
the source code to look at:

	http://www.radiance-online.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/ray/src/util/rad.c

There was an upgrade to the general rendering quality back in 2003:

	http://www.radiance-online.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/ray/src/util/ 
rad.c.diff?r1=2.71&r2=2.72

Playing with the -n option is probably the best way to see what  
happens if you don't care for C code.

Hi Nick,

You generally seem to know what's going on, so let me just verify and

That is correct.  Bear in mind that certain surfaces do not report  
irradiance, such as glass, which you see through as usual with the -i  
option.

Right.

Right again -- sources don't report light landing on them  
(irradiance), since they are considered to be emitters, and thus  
aren't affected by the -i option.

Message-ID: <da2acf910809051927l37900acl208a1b111caeac93@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I tried to apply the factor of 179 to the scaled brightness from
pvalue. However, it seems that the value is still slightly off from
the actual one read from psfview.

The value from pfsview is 2.579e+4

while from pvalue is 2.803e+4

i used pvalue -b -o sample.hdr

Is there an exact value for the scale ?


Thanks

Hi Cw,

I'm not sure how pfsview converts colors to luminance values, but it  
may apply a different set of coefficients from those used in Radiance  
(and pvalue).  This could explain the discrepancy.  The best way to  
check is to compare values for a gray pixel, which should be the same  
regardless of the color -> luminance conversion.

Also, are you 100% sure you are checking the exact same pixel(s)?

Hi Greg,
Thanks for replying so fast.
So i assume that the value read off from ximage is the same at that
from pvalue ?

Using -b -o option  and a factor of 179 ?
Sorry but i could get not the radiance source compiled for ximage ;(

Thanks

Hi Chew,

Yes, pvalue -o -b * 179 and the ximage 'l' command should report the  
same values for the same pixels, though it's a bit difficult to know  
if you are in fact checking the same pixels -- the ximage 'p' command  
can help with that.

I guess this is moot since you couldn't compile ximage.  I believe  
Ecotect offers a Windows-ready substitute free of charge.

Best,
-Greg

Greg,

I just got the go-ahead from my wife to come to the Radiance 
Workshop this year, and I hope there's space to present. If there 
is, I'd like to present:

Imaging Fluid Dynamics for Art

In this talk, I will present methods that I have used for nearly 
10 years of modeling, rendering, and display of digital artwork. 
This includes creating and converting data from computational 
fluid dynamics research, handling large models, rendering 
large single frames, and experimental display techniques.

HI greg,

Thanks, i believe for RGB, the conversion to radiance units is the same factor ?

I think as compared to PFSview, the pixels for Pvalues are shifted -1
-1 for x and y.

Thanks

Hi,

from the manpage of pfsinrgbe[1]:

--
"IMPORTANT NOTE

There is an incompatibility between viewers of RGBE format in terms of
absolute luminance values. The ximage viewer from Radiance package
expects radiance values in RGBE files and uses the WHITE_EFFICACY
constant equal to 179.0f to convert from radiance to luminance. This in
practice means that the values displayed with pfsview maybe higher than
expected. To compensate for this incompatibility we suggest to use
pfsabsolute command:

pfsinrgbe measured_luminance.hdr | pfsabsolute 1 179 | pfsview

This is not necessary when RGBE files are saved using pfsoutrgbe,
Radiance package, mkhdr or Photospheare. This is also not relevant when
only relative absolute values are considered."
--

Can you please try the work-around and tell us if you get the expected
results than?

CU Lars.

I think the authors did not implement this simply because it already
exists - pvalue has been around for a while. So you could write your own
pvalue tool, in something like the pfsout-tools, but with a text format
target. Another simple way would be to combine pfsabsolute and
pfsoutppm, to create an ascii-text coded grey-scale image with linear
mapping, and read out the values than. But the accuracy would be very
bad (8bit).

Greetings from Singapore :).

Thanks for the suggestion. i think will stick with pvalue then.

So when is the next time you dropping by Singapore?

Problem solved, I think.  The confusion arose from me jumping to
conclusions based my comparison of luminance/illuminance images.  I saw
the bright floor plane outside and assumed it was a mistake.  It
actually turned out that the reflectance of the local ground plane was
set to 0.25 while gensky defaults to 0.2.

Perhaps 0.25 is a bit too high for asphalt but reasonable for concrete? 
BRE [1] list a table of surface reflectances with asphalt = 0.07 and
concrete = 0.2 ~ 0.3.  Anyone know of a more detailed reference for
surface reflectances?

I think in this case, taking a grey chart, going out and finding the
value by comparision would work well. The problem is that there are so
many different types of concrete (granularity, additions, surface
finishing) plus outside factors (wet / dry etc) that you cannot get one
color / reflectance for the material.

BTW if I look at the road in front of the office I am working in right
now, I also wonder if the reflectance of the real-world asfalt is not
much higher. The 0.07 may be "pure" asfalt (so almost black as bitumen)
while the road surface here contains sand and stones to make it rough
and dureable. So if you walk around with your grey chart, just make one
more comparision ;-)

One problem with outdoors surfaces is that the values measured in lab
can be far apart from real world. Erosion, dust, humidity, vegetation...
many factors affect what we see outside, besides the pure "material". So
I guess in a proper simulation, one should always try to check these
reflectances, at least if they have big influence on the result.

So if I understand well, when we calculate irradiance image (rpict -i
option) depending of surface materials, for various objects different values
are reported :
*light sources (light,glow) - radiance
*glass - radiance?
*trans - ?
*illum - radiance?
*other materials - irradiance

Please fill the blanks :)

Thanks,
Marija

Hi Marija,

The complete list of materials that are completelly ignored when -i  
is set:

trans
trans2
dielectric
interface
mist
glass

Surfaces made of these materials pass as if they aren't there.  Light  
sources, illum's, etc. yield radiance rather than irradiance.  This  
includes surfaces modified by the following materials:

light
illum
glow
spotlight

I hope this clarifies matters.
-Greg

What does this exactly mean when values on the image are traced in ximage?
For example if I have a window made of some glass material or some curtain
on it made of trans material. On irradiance image when I try to trace value
of some pixel on the window surface, what do I get? Is it irradiance of the
objects behind the window (outside ground, buildings etc)? Does
window/curtain transmittance has an influence on reported value?

What happens for surfaces made of transparent BRTfunc materials (like double
glazing)? Are they ignored too, or their irradiance value is reported?

Thanks again,
Marija

If you query a pixel on a window, the window acts as if it's not  
there, so it's transmittance has no effect.

The BRTDfunc isn't one of the materials on the list, so it shows up  
with an irradiance value like other materials.  I'm sorry if this is  
confusing, but you can usually tell simply by looking at the image  
which materials are transparent and which aren't.  If you want all  
materials to be treated the same and irradiance to be computed for  
everything, you can use the following in place of the rpict -i option:

vwrays [view options] -ff -x xres -y yres -pa 0 | rtrace -h -ff -opN  
octree | rtrace -ffc -I -x xres -y yres > irrad.pic

The first trace comes up with the intersection points and surface  
normals for the second trace, which computes irradiance at those  
points.  You need to be sure that your view has no distant light  
sources in it, since those don't have intersection points or surface  
normals.

Yes.

> Does window/curtain transmittance has an influence on reported value?

Depends.  To be clear (pun!), let's say you have a view from the outside 
of the building looking in, and you trace a pixel that shows floor 
behind the curtain wall.  In this case, the irradiance value returned is 
the irradiance on the floor, and it is of course modified (reduced) by 
the reflectance and absorptance of the glass.  Now, let's say you have a 
view from inside a building, and you trace a pixel on the ground 
outside.  In this case, the irradiance is not influenced at all by the 
glass, even though you are tracing a ray through the glass.

Obviously, I forgot the octree on the second rtrace command.  Also,  
you need to specify the appropriate x and y resolutions for square  
pixels, or use the more complicated procedure with the vwrays -d  
option specified on the man page:

Dear List,


what would be sort of "ball park" figures for the radiance of the Sun 
and of a clear blue sky?

I have found sources that indicate the irradiance from the Sun to be on 
the order of 1400 W/m^2, across all wavelengths, with probably around 
half being within the visible spectrum.

I am primarily interested in the visible spectrum, and would like to 
know the RGB radiances of the Sun, say at noon at the Equator.

I have contemplated stealing this information from the output of gensky, 
but if someone has this information (or a link) please let me know

Best,
Claus

You can download weather data files that contain information like  
direct normal,
diffuse and global horizontal radiation in Wh/m^2 here:

http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/cfm/weather_data.cfm

This data is for the EnergyPlus program. You can download the 'stat'  
files
which are readable text files with average values for wetware  
('brain') processing.

There is also the Satel-Light website but I don't think it covers  
areas outside of Europe:

I have been working through the tutorials of A. Jacobs and some of the
tutorials in Rendering with Radiance, but I have not come across a text
describing how to obtain the different contributions to the total
illuminance on a surface. I would like to hear how I can obtain the direct,
diffuse and reflected component of the illuminance? Do I have to find the
parameters in the source code, or is there someone who has made it easy for
me and created a command for this (my fingers are crossed)?



In advance ? I would like to say thank you for any respond to this query?

I would simply do so:
A)   -ab 0 and sun -> direct from sun only
B)   -ab 1 and no sun-> direct from sky only


C)   -ab n>1 and no sky -> subtract case A, is reflected after  
sunlight only
D)   -ab n>1 and no sun -> subtract case B, is reflected after sky only


performing the difference of the various analyses you can get the  
various values.

alternatively you can use rtcontrib and get the contribution of  
illuminance coming from a particular surface modifier...
sunlight
skylight
walls
....
It is not that difficult.

Also try to see if there is something about this here:
http://web.mac.com/geotrupes/iWeb/Site/Tutorials.html
I think there should be a mini tutorial with some tricks...
hope it helps

Subject: [Radiance-general] Custom false color palette
Message-ID: <694e132c0809171510m1100bb36g26a5060c72c987ef@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to make a false color / pseudo color image that matches the
color palette from a non-lighting program. It would work great with
four nested IF statements, but falsecolor -r/g/b doesn't seem to want
to take them. Has anybody come up with a workaround for this or am I
better off editing the falsecolor script?

Perhaps there is a way to use higher order functions?

Here's an image of the scale and a close numerical pseudocolor
traversal: http://tinyurl.com/4e2x7m

This would be the if statement for the falsecolor -r argument:
if(v-5/7,1,if(v-4/7,7v-4,if(v-2/7,0,if(v-1/7,2-7v,7v))))

Hi Dave,

Maybe not direct answer to your question. In RadDisplay tool
http://deluminaelab.com/en/raddisplay_details.html you can define
custom palette for radiance images.

Palette is not defined with the functions (we didn't implement that
feature yet), but you can select individual palette colors or define
start and end color and program will generate the palette. You can
also define palette maximum and minimum value, which can also be very
helpful in some cases.

If you must follow the formula then it is better to work with
falsecolor program.

Subject: [Radiance-general] radmap (on windows)
Message-ID: <1221736756.3461.1274650811@webmail.messagingengine.com>

Hi,

I've just started to look at using radmap, but am having some teething
problems.  It seems to generate a load of sky images but fails at the
next stage, creating cumulative sky files of zero size.

I've attached the (shortened) command output below.  Any ideas what I'm
doing wrong?  (I'm using the latest Windows binaries and am pretty sure
environment variables are set correctly and I can render the scene file
normally)  I will try running on Linux this afternoon, but it would be
more convenient to be able to use it in Windows.

Thanks for your help,

Nick

Hi Nick,

I have not compiled Radiance in a while but if I remember right this kind of errors you see when you don't have the TIFF libraries installed. Just download rad3R8supp.tar.bz2 or whatever is the current version, unpack it in the buld directory (ray) and recompile. This should hopefully be sufficient to cure the problem.

Regards,
 Erwin

You could just make a backport of the radiance packages from Debian's
Lenny/testing or Hardy (or upgrade to Hardy):


(not tested, but I hope it works:)

sudo apt-get install devscripts fakeroot build-essential
sudo apt-get install debhelper libtiff4-dev libx11-dev libglu1-mesa-dev \

Hi Nick,

The libtiff distribution I currently have in Radiance seems to have a  
broken build system, and is failing on a lot of platforms.  I think I  
just need to remove it, and clear the related dependencies from px/ 
Rmakefile.  I'm pretty sure libtiff is included in most modern OS's,  
though I could use some verification on that point.  I'm copying this  
discussion to the dev list, and we'll sort it out there.

Meanwhile, you should be able to get the px tools to compile by  
substituting the attached px/Rmakefile and running "rmake install" in  
the px directory.

Best,
-Greg

Hi Dave,

Your formula should be fine, you just need to remember there's no  
implied multiplication.  Instead of:

	if(v-5/7,1,if(v-4/7,7v-4,if(v-2/7,0,if(v-1/7,2-7v,7v))))

use:

	falsecolor -r "if(v-5/7,1,if(v-4/7,7*v-4,if(v-2/7,0,if(v-1/7,2-7*v, 
7*v))))" ...

Hope this helps.

Aha, that was it, Greg. Thank you very much, it was a long day.

I still prefer the thermal- and very-technical-looking 3.8+ scale, but
for anybody interested, here are the falsecolor switches for the scale
I was talking about starting at black:

-r 'if(v-5/7,1,if(v-4/7,7*v-4,if(v-2/7,0,if(v-1/7,2-7*v,7*v))))'
-g 'if(v-6/7,7*v-6,if(v-5/7,6-7*v,if(v-3/7,1,if(v-2/7,7*v-2,0))))'
-b 'if(v-6/7,7*v-6,if(v-4/7,0,if(v-3/7,4-7*v,if(v-1/7,1,7*v))))'

...and starting at a 1/3 gray:

-r 'if(v-5/7,1,if(v-4/7,7*v-4,if(v-2/7,0,if(v-1/7,2-7*v,7*v+1/3))))'
-g 'if(v-6/7,7*v-6,if(v-5/7,6-7*v,if(v-3/7,1,if(v-2/7,7*v-2,if(v-1/7,0,1/3-7*v*1/3)))))'
-b 'if(v-6/7,7*v-6,if(v-4/7,0,if(v-3/7,4-7*v,if(v-1/7,1,7*v+1/3))))'

(Watch out for the line breaks.)

Whoops, the initial slope was incorrect for the red and blue on the
gray version:

-r 'if(v-5/7,1,if(v-4/7,7*v-4,if(v-2/7,0,if(v-1/7,2-7*v,7*v*2/3+1/3))))'

-b 'if(v-6/7,7*v-6,if(v-4/7,0,if(v-3/7,4-7*v,if(v-1/7,1,7*v*2/3+1/3))))'

That should do it. Mea culpa.

http://www.bakharev.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=33&lang=english

we used this CAL-code:
=================================
    min : $min ;
    max : $max ;
    step : $step ;
    scale : $max-$min ;

    clip(x) : if(x-1,1,if(x,x,0));

    render(x) = floor((x-min)/step)*step/scale;
    {render(x) = (x-min)/scale;}


    interp_arr10(x, arr) = ( (x-floor(x)) *
arr(ceil(x)+1)-arr(floor(x)+1)) / 1 ) + arr(floor(x)+1);
    interp_arr(x, arr) = interp_arr10(x*10, arr);

    def_red(x) = interp_arr(x, def_red_arr);
    def_grn(x) = interp_arr(x, def_grn_arr);
    def_blu(x) = interp_arr(x, def_blu_arr);

    def_red_arr(i) : select(i,
.03,.17,.31,.45,.57,.67,.76,.84,.90,.97,.99 );
    def_grn_arr(i) : select(i,
.10,.21,.32,.43,.53,.60,.69,.78,.87,.96,.99 );
    def_blu_arr(i) : select(i,
.27,.34,.41,.47,.53,.58,.64,.74,.85,.95,.96 );

    in = 1;

    ro = if(in, def_red(clip(render(v))), rorig);
    go = if(in, def_grn(clip(render(v))), gorig);
    bo = if(in, def_blu(clip(render(v))), borig);
=================================

Where you can implement your own palette by changing these lines:
...select(i, .03,.17,.31,.45,.57,.67,.76,.84,.90,.97,.99 );
...select(i, .10,.21,.32,.43,.53,.60,.69,.78,.87,.96,.99 );

I've been scratching my head for a while over this one (I'm sure it's
something stupid I've done).  But I'm exporting from Ecotect using a
100lux overcast sky, rendering with the -i option to get a daylight
factor image.  I've narrowed it down to something that looks like
self-luminous ceiling soffits (I've rendered the scene with all the
other objects apart from the floor slabs and it's fine) - tracing the
illuminance value on the roof gives 100Lux as expected, but the floor
slabs are ablaze with light (>1kLux).  The image
(http://ndoylend.fastmail.fm/temp/test0_c5.jpg) looks pretty cool, but
it's absolutely useless.

Can anyone shed some light (sorry) on this one?

Cool indeed! I vote for it for the Radiance Gallery!

> Can anyone shed some light (sorry) on this one?

Looks like your ceilings and floors are emitting light onto the next  
plane below.
Check the material definition of the ceiling material. This looks  
like a glow
(for example from the sky definition) or illum because it seems to  
emit only in one
direction (the face's front which is pointing down here).

What material or material name did you assign to the ceiling? Did you  
modify the
Ecotect scene manually?

Thomas

Here's another one:

What's your -av  setting? You have  a very dark sky and a typical -av  
value
would increase your lighting levels quite significantly in this  
situation. At
the edges of the floors/ceilings this would be less noticeable  
because there
is some sky or ground glow in direct view. In the centre of the  
planes the -av
setting would brighten up the material when the number of ambient  
bounces
is exceeded.

It might just be an insane idea I head over my breakfast coffee.

I think that was it, it must have been good coffee.  I found Rad was
setting an ambient value of 10.  I added -av 0.01 0.01 0.01 to the .rif
file's render option and got images that weren't so groovy looking but
did give a better indication of something like a reasonable daylight
factor. (http://ndoylend.fastmail.fm/temp/test02_c5.jpg)

This is with an indirect setting of 2.  I suppose I should reduce the
ambient value to zero and increase the indirect to get a more realistic
DF, but is it worth it (these are for visualisation only)?

Thanks for the suggestion,

Nick

I just gave up trying to get it to run on Windows, even running without
any temporary files left hanging around it still generated a bunch of
zero length composite sky files and failed.

I had more luck running under Linux, and it seemed to do its thing much
faster.  However, I'm not sure how to interpret the results!  To test I
created a flat ground plane and looked at the cumulative map - the
results were about 822kWh/m2.yr when I traced points on the original kWh
image and approximately the same in the false coloured kWh image.  If I
looked at the source EPW data I found a cumulative global horizontal
radiation to be more like in the region of  1200kWh/m2.yr.  Shouldn't
they be the same (assuming I set lat/lon/mer correctly)?

The MJ scaled image didn't make much sense - I thought that 1kWh is
3.6MJ, but I get a much lower result when I look at MJ than kWh.

Are there any papers describing the program in more detail (I've looked
only briefly at the man page and a .pdf presentation so I'm probably
missing something)?

Thanks,

Nick

Message-ID: <OF69E5AD77.A3B2DA4B-ONC12574CC.004AD3ED-C12574CC.004D478B@velux.com>

Hi,

I'm making a short comparison between illuminance values obtained in 
DAYSIM and Radiance for a specific day/time, and the results I obtain show 
a  ratherbig difference with Radiance having values twice as high.

I compare the values in the annual illuminance profil (.ill) generated by 
DAYSIM, with values I obtained in Radiance for the same day/time. I 
defined the Radiance sky description using the "direct normal irradiance" 
and the "diffuse horizontal irradiance" values from the climate data used 
in DAYSIM. 

What can be the source of such large differences?


I use the following in Radiance:

You can increase the -ab to 3 or 4. Beyond that I don't think it would
make a visible difference.

Keep a small value for your '-av' setting. This will also smooth out the
image a bit and if you're not after accuracy you don't have to worry if
the DF gets a bit of a lift.

PS: You're right, the first image looks much cooler!

Hi Nicolas,

Daysim is using the Perez Sky model, so I would use gendaylit instead of
gensky for a comparision.
Secondly, I assume, that you have to use the -R instead of the -r
Option, since you are dealing with irradiance rather than radiance. This
is causing the big difference, I assume.
But  be careful: -R is expecting horizontal direct irradiation, not
direct normal irradiance!

If you're familiar with gnuplot you should be able to import the rtrace
values as point cloud, create contours and export as dxf. There are
other data visualizers around like MayaVi or OpenDX that allow you
to import points and export lines in DXF. It depends on the time you
want to spend to learn one of these tools.

And then you've always the option to interpolate the values to find
the locations of points on the 2% line and draw the line by hand.

Dear Nicolas:

 

I agree with Jan that using gensky and comparing the results with Daysim
is a bit meaningless. As far as accurate Daysim accuracy compared to
Radiance classic is concerned, we had an email trail on this  last week
in the Daysim discussion forum
(http://groups.google.com/group/daysim/browse_thread/thread/3029e67b22c2
2a830) . 

 

Best regards,

 

Christoph

Hi Jan,

Thanks for the input. I've used gendaylit and performed the calculations 
again, results now show an average difference of 3-4%. I'm glad I could 
find an update for gendaylit that supports Cygwin on the Fraunhofer site.

Re: [Radiance-general] DAYSIM vs. Radiance illuminance values






Hi Nicolas,

Daysim is using the Perez Sky model, so I would use gendaylit instead of 
gensky for a comparision. 
Secondly, I assume, that you have to use the -R instead of the -r Option, 
since you are dealing with irradiance rather than radiance. This is 
causing the big difference, I assume.
But  be careful: -R is expecting horizontal direct irradiation, not direct 
normal irradiance!

Hi, 

I'm making a short comparison between illuminance values obtained in 
DAYSIM and Radiance for a specific day/time, and the results I obtain show 
a  ratherbig difference with Radiance having values twice as high. 

I compare the values in the annual illuminance profil (.ill) generated by 
DAYSIM, with values I obtained in Radiance for the same day/time. I 
defined the Radiance sky description using the "direct normal irradiance" 
and the "diffuse horizontal irradiance" values from the climate data used 
in DAYSIM. 

What can be the source of such large differences? 


I use the following in Radiance:

I'm sure I had it working on Windows once but I now can't get it to pick
up the coeff_perez.dat file - it's in my radiance/lib folder, correctly
specified in my RADPATH variable.  Should it be somewhere else?

Compiling on Ubuntu 7.10 seems to work, albeit with the following
warning:

gcc  -c fropen.c
fropen.c: In function $B!F(Bfropen$B!G(B:
fropen.c:45: warning: incompatible implicit declaration of built-in

Should I worry about this?

Finally, which output option should I use if I want similar output to
gensky, W/m2.sr (solar), W/m2.sr (visible), or lm/m2.sr.  I'm guessing
the former?

Hi Nick,

Use default value - 0, since Radiance output is in radiance values for
visible part of light.

Note:
- if you are using irradiance values from EPW files use  -W dir_norm
diff_horiz
- if you are using irradiance values from Stal-light files (for Europe) use
-G dir_horiz dif_horiz

Don't worry for fropen error on Ubuntu

Message-ID: <20080925115923.rr09dklcg044k8k4@www.sms.ed.ac.uk>


Hi

I was wondering if someone knows how to generate a view file in  
Radiance, given real life
camera calibration parameters. I've created a scene and view file in  
Radiance and I'm now trying to create the exact geometric model in  
real life.

I have the focal length and image resolution, so can compute the -vh  
and -vv angle values but the main problem is trying to compute the -vp  
and -vd parameters.

I have the 3x3 Rotation matrix and 3x1 Translation vector from using  
the Bouget Camera Calibration Toolbox in Matlab. The axes are the same  
as for my Radiance scene but I need to translate the camera reference  
frame origin to the geometric world scene origin.

Also I'd like to know how to do the Rotation as well for other images  
I have whereby after calibration,  the axes may not be aligned.
I've been looking in a few books but find some things ambiguous and  
getting a bit confused, so just wondering if somebody has a quick  
solution.

I've considered 'cheating' by re-writing the geometry in the .rad file  
so that the camera reference frame origin is at the geometric world  
origin, but I'd prefer not to do this.

Any help is greatly appreciated

Thanks

Tarik

Dear Radiance users,

As you probably know, registrations are now open for the next Radiance workshop which will take place in Fribourg (Switzerland) from 30 to 31 October 2008 (see home.hefr.ch/compag/rw2008/<http://home.hefr.ch/compag/rw2008/> ).  We expect to receive your registration before the end of September.
More important: the hotel reservation should be made through the Fribourg Tourism office using the dedicated form not later than Friday 26th September. This is due to the fact that the rooms we have pre-booked for the workshop cannot be held longer since there is another big congress in need of room space that may require them...

Hi Tarik,

I should be able to help you. From what you are writing I have been 
through many of the same things. I have used the Bouget calibration 
toolbox some years ago, so I have forgotten the details. I am presently 
using my own matlab based calibration tool, but the process of making a 
link to Radiance should be the same.

What I have done is to make a simple Matlab script which auto-generates 
a Radiance view file (.vp). Here is an example of the output from my 
script for a given image where I have calibrated the camera to a 
checker-board in the image:

rview -vtv -vp -2.555731 -1.572937 1.778183 -vd 0.807129 0.430026 
-0.404500 -vu 0.359249 0.185955 0.914527 -vh 45.809853 -vv 31.486144

As stated: I have forgotten Bouget calibration details, but if you have 
the 3x3 rotation and the 3x1 translation you are all set to go. In what 
I am writing I am assuming that the rotation and translation information 
constitutes transformation from world to camera (not vice versa).

I my code I have the world to camera transformation as a 4x4 matrix, 
where the upper left 3x3 is the rotation, and the upper three elements 
of the left-most column is the translation vector (standard 
transformation matrix in homogenuous coordinates).

Here is my Matlab code that autogenerates the .vp file:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

%world2cam is a 4x4 transformation from world to camera coordinates
%
%focallength_in_pixels is the estimated camera focal length measured in 
pixels (it may be a negative number
%in the Bouget toolbox ... in that case multiply by -1 in the 
expressions below)

%inverse to get camera to world transformation
cam2world = inv(world2cam);

%save camera parameters in a format directly applicable
%for RADIANCE rendering engine
camfilename = strcat(path,'CAMERA.vp');
fid = fopen(camfilename, 'w');
fprintf(fid, 'rview -vtv ');
fprintf(fid, '-vp %.6f %.6f %.6f ', cam2world(1:3,4));
fprintf(fid, '-vd %.6f %.6f %.6f ', -world2cam(3,1:3));
fprintf(fid, '-vu %.6f %.6f %.6f ', world2cam(2,1:3));
fprintf(fid, '-vh %.6f ', rad2deg(2*atan2(0.5*xres, 
focallength_in_pixels)));
fprintf(fid, '-vv %.6f\n', rad2deg(2*atan2(0.5*yres, 
focallength_in_pixels)));
fclose(fid);


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The part in your mail that concerns multiple images and axes that are 
not aligned I do not understand so I can't assist on that.

Sincerely,
Claus


P.S. I have the same exporting facility generating a MAXscript that will 
set up a matched camera in 3D studio max, but max has built-in camera 
matching.

If you have a nice perspective image you could try the 'match photo'  
feature in SketchUp:

Only works for smaller values of 'exact', though.

Just in case that you do this - do not rewrite the geometry but use an xform-statement to transform the scene. Still this is not really useful for animations, and I guess there have been enough hints for generating the view points now - so this is just for completeness ;-)

Have a nice week-end!

Lars.

Hi George,

the source code of photon mapping can be downloaded here:

http://www.ise.fhg.de/radiance

Note: This version of pmap (4.3.1) is only compatible with the RADIANCE
3.7P2 version, which can be downloaded at the same site.
But we have no experience compiling it on a Mac.

Good luck!

Jan

I guess it is possible and actually another option is to use radzilla...
I have used pmap a while ago (2006) with both radiance and radzilla.
radzilla had the big advantage of having just one command for the  
whole process.
