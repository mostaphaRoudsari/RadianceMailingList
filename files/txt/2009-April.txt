Message-ID: <3acd9e4a0904011127h26dba9c4r6b17c6cd95d4e36b@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

A bared cylinder lamp (with 60cm length and 3.2cm diameter) is installed on
the wall and illuminance values were measured at some points and to some
directions as shown in the linked image. Unfortunately, the illuminance
values calculated with Radiance are different from measured values,
especially when the sensor is near the lamp or  the incident angles are high
(K~O).

Link image <http://iga.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/tmp/test.gif>

What can be supposed as the cause of the discrepancy?

rtrace command was as follow.
cat pts.pts | rtrace -I -oov -ar 128 -ad 512 -as 256 -ab 2 -ds 0.02 test.oct
> test.dat

and all the walls, floor and ceiling was covered with non-glossy black
paper. (reflectance 0.05)


Sung.

Hi Sung,

Try adding the following parameters to your rtrace command:

	-dj .7 -dt 0

How sure are you of your surface reflectances?  Did you actually  
measure the lamp output, or are you assuming the manufacturer's lumen  
specification is correct?  How far off are your values?

Since you notice the most errors near to the lamp and at low angles,  
it's possible that the Fresnel effects are important.  The emission  
of the fluorescent phosphor may be considered diffuse, but the actual  
output of the lamp will be a function of angle due to Fresnel  
reflection of the glass bulb.  You can account for this  
(approximately) by applying the "winxmit.cal" function included with  
Radiance, like so:

void brightfunc Fresnel_effect
2 winxmit winxmit.cal
0
0

Fresnel_effect light lamp_light
0
0
3 X X X

lamp_light cylinder fluorescent_tube
(etc...)

I think you get the idea.

Either that or - what would be the better way in my opinion - move printing to a
better working books on demand service. There're some (supposed to be) good ones
in Germany - while they require a little yearly fee to get a ISBN number for you
and keep the book online, they don't just drop the book from printing.

Hi Lars,

I ordered the book mid-December through BiggerBooks.com
http://www.biggerbooks.com/bk_detail.aspx?referrer=bbcj&AID=9467039&PID=536211&SID=a127d3077473v29595007&ISBN=0974538108

It took about a month, but eventually I got the book. At the time the book
cost $60, it looks like they raised the price somewhat.

Dear Greg,

Thank you for your advice and I just tried as you said but actually the
results were not improved as following link.

*http://iga.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/xe/?document_srl=346*

That might be so because the lamp is actually UV lamp but as you know, there
is almost no difference between flourescent and UV lamps besides with or
without phosphor coating on the surface of lamp. Nevertheless,
I thought the absence of phosphor coating could cause some differences on
the diffuse of UV including the Fresnel effects. I'm finding some references
on the diffuse of UV lamps.
The reflectances were referred to a japanese paper which had done
experiements with UV and the UV output of lamp was referred to the
manufacturer's specification but the UV intensities at 1 m distance is
almost the same.

 Additionally, I'm checking the UV sensor but as it also follows cosine law
as illuminance sensors do, there might be no problem with UV sensor.

Dear Sung,

It seems I misread your diagram the first time, so misinterpreted  
your problem.  I'm thinking now that the issue may be the cosine  
correction of your sensors rather than what is going on in Radiance.   
Most lux sensors have a crude calibration with respect to incident  
angle.  I recommend checking your sensors against one that is more  
reliable, or at least verifying that they have the proper cosine  
response by measuring a point source at varying incident angles.

Best,
-Greg

Dear colleagues,

 

My apologies for any cross-posting. This email is mainly directed
towards those of you located in the larger Boston area. 

 

In an effort to reach out to the local design community and to promote
the use of daylight in buildings we will be offering a series of free
one hour brown-bag presentations at the Harvard Design School starting
on Monday, April 20, at noon in Stubbins, Gund Hall, 48 Quincy Street in
Cambridge. In this initial presentation I will be discussing the results
of two very recent studies: A validation of 3ds Max Design compared to
indoor illuminance measurements as well as a study that investigated
common simulation mistakes that daylight simulation novices make. The
focus audience for this presentation are design practitioners interested
in adding physically based daylight simulations to their design
portfolio. Following the presentation you are very welcome to stay
around for a bit and share some of your own simulation activities. 

 

Please RVSP Brooke King at bking@gsd.harvard.edu should you intend to
join us. There will be no lunch provided but you are welcome to bring
your own. The conference room is located next to our cafeteria.

 

I look forward to meeting some of you in a few weeks. Best regards,

 

Christoph

No problem.  It was really my fault for not looking at your nicely  
prepared diagram more closely -- I somehow missed the numerical  
table.  You explained your problem very well.

Does anybody know how can we use the Radiace calculate the direct solar
radiation and diffuse solar radiation on the building's envelope?

I can just use some basic function of Radiance such as the simple daylight
factor and illluminance calculation. if i want to learn some advanceed
function, where should i start? Would you give me some advices?

Hi Vincent,

if I would not know the difficulties to get a copy of it, I would ask
you to first browse through the book "Rendering with Radiance". If you
have access to it, this is the way to start. If not, I would advice you
to go through through the documentation done by Axel Jacobs (he made up
two great tutorials, if you cannot find the link I can look through my
bookmarks), which is available as pdf. After reading a bit, the first
thing you will understand is that actually the output you get from
radiance IS radiance (or irradiance which is most probably what you
need) as long as you do not convert it into photopic units. The easiest
way to divide the irradiance into diffuse and directed I could think of
would be to do a rendering with sun and sky and ambient calculation and
then substract the resulting pixel values of a rendering of only the sun
with ambient bounces = 0 (which is the direct component).

Dear Greg,

I have done some additional measurements and the results show as follow.


http://iga.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/tmp/test01.gif  Setup

http://iga.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/tmp/test02.gif  Fluorescent lamp (Measurement)

http://iga.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/tmp/test03.gif  Simulation

http://iga.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/tmp/test04.gif  UV lamp (Measurement)



The results indicate the UV lamp has different diffuse characteristics
compared with common fluorescent lamps if the UVC sensor is cosine corrected
well as written in the sensor. If there is no problem with UVC sensor, it
might be not easy to model UV lamp with RADIANCE.





Best Regards,



Sung

Hi Sung,

I'm not exactly sure what we are looking at with these plots, but  
it's clear that you need to characterize the sensor response in order  
to understand the situation.  Did  you perform the cosine sensitivity  
experiment I suggested?  You could mask off a portion of the center  
of a tube if you don't have a small UV source, and see how the sensor  
responds as a function of incident angle at a fixed distance.

Hi,

I am rather curious about these reports, as we may have to set up some
uv sensors for another application soon. What kind of "cosine-corrected
sensor" do you use? I know that type of probe head which is connected to
a fibre leading to the sensor. As far as I understood it, the cosine
correction happens simply by using a diffusing piece of transmissive
material, that scatters light entering from any direction. I have always
been curious how these can achieve a real cosine correction, as the
scattering material is always mounted behind a thin ring to hold it in
place, thus never seeing full 180 degree. In the case of uv, the
wavelength dependance of the scattering may also play a role. Have all
components been tested for uv transmittance, or is it possible that any
component is made for i.e. visible light only? Or are you using an
entirely different set-up, e.g. not a probe connected to fibre but a
specific uv sensor?

CU Lars.

Yes, I checked cosine sensitivity but the results showed that UV sensor did
not calibrated by cosine law. I have two UV sensors made by different maker,
but both showed almost same responses to incident angle. I am going to ask
the maker on this problem and I think the UV sensors might not cosine
calibarated with UV.

Dear Lars,
I think UV sensors would be calibarated to reponse according to cosine
law. It can be controlled with geometry of sensor body and diffuser plate
attached on the receptor and I think it shoud be as shown in figure
test06.gif (FL, illuminance sensors). I used UV sensor body sending electric
signal to datalogger and the datalogger convert the signal to UV intensity
according to calibration curve as usual photosensors.

Hi Sung,

This then explains the discrepancies you were seeing with your  
previous comparisons between simulations (Radiance) and measurements.

You could use the new rsensor program to replicate your UV sensors  
response to get a match that way if you cannot modify the sensor.

Hi All,

I am a keen Radiance user since one year now but unfortunatly, not
having access to a Linux machine, I am forced to stick to pc. This is
under a number of aspect quite convenient because being an architect,
all of the other software I use is pc-based and I am totally unnfamiliar
with the linux os. I hope you can help me bearing in mind my type of use
of the software.
I have a couple of questions:

I understand radiance calculates irradiance and then uses a standard
conversion factor Kr=179 lumens/watt. Hence it should be possible to use
it for solar irradiation calculation as well as for light analysis.
My question is, how can I display directly watts/m2 instead of lux?

As well, in order to perform irradiation analysis a sky generated
following the perez-all weather model would be more accurate than just
using the standardCIE skies supported by gensky. I understand there is
an application called gendaylit that does exectly this. From where can I
download a windows version? 

Thanks for your help,

Giovanni Betti

Depends on what you mean by display. The most useful way would be 
falsecolor images. As falsecolor by default multiplies pixel values by 
179 to get from radiometric to photometric units, you must tell it to 
use a multiplier of 1 instead of 179. Than, you most probably have to 
set the scale in a way that you see the irradiances in your image. One 
example, using a scale of 0-5000 and the multiplier 1 (to avoid the 
conversion to lx) would be like this:

falsecolor -i input.hdr -m 1 -s 5000 -l "Watts/m2" > output.hdr

Thanks for your quick reply Lars, of cousrse I meant Windows!!! ;)
So here I am into the Command Prompt but if I specify what you suggested
me pcomb fails and no output is created (more precisely: a 0 kb file is
created as output). The error I receive is about bad picture size... Any
clue about how I can fix that?

The same command works here. Most probably something is wrong with your 
Radiance installation, the most common origin of all trouble are PATH 
and RAYPATH settings not pointing to the right directories. But here we 
hit a point that I cannot really help you - I have zero experience with 
Radiance on Windows, and usually it is guaranteed 100% more pain for 
doing the same. Can you check your installation?

These are not programs or files, RAYPATH and PATH are (required)
environment variables ;-) Is your radiance-installation functional?
Where did you get it from, by compiling it or bey downloading binaries?

Giovanni, right-click on My Computer, select Properties, go to the
Advanced tab, click the Environment Variables button near the bottom. In
the upper window you should have a variable called PATH and a variable
called RAYPATH. If you don't have them, or the values don't match the
following, create  or edit them accordingly...

PATH = .;C:\Program Files\MinGW-Radiance\bin;$PATH
RAYPATH = .;C:\Program Files\MinGW-Radiance\lib

At least that's how it's set up on mine using the MingW binaries from
http://www.bozzograo.net/radiance/
If your radiance bin or lib directories are located elsewhere on your C
drive, change accordingly.

Scott,

Thanks for the info. I know that the solution can be as simple as that.

This data is of course important only for the (annual) daylighting
calculation. Daysim is using this data. I suspect even EPlus or eQuest
will use this data for daylight control.

Thanks,

Giovanni,
 
I have the windows version of radiance on my machine.  I don't think it comes with false color.  I believe this is because false color is a c-shell script and windows does not use C-shells, it uses the dos prompt instead.  If I were you, I would look into adding Cygwin to your windows computer and installing radiance within Cygwin.  Then you would have the full functionality of radiance on a windows machine.  (This is what I do and it works great)  (And is free)  You could also set up a dual boot on your machine and either boot radiance or boot linux (not a practical solution in my opinion) (also free).  Or you could use VMware and run both windows and linux simultaneously.  This is possibly the best option, but I've never tried it since I don't own a copy of VMware. (not free)
 
As far as the Cygwin option goes, I have not been able to compile radiance on Cygwin myself and have relied on the link below.  I would love to know how it was done.  I have however, been able to compile radiance on Suse Linux...
 
For Cygwin radiance see...  http://www.dream.unipa.it/dream/pub/dot/anselmo/radiance/03.php and follow the link (http://www.bozzograo.net/radiance/) to the updated binaries.  (Thanks again to Francesco Anselmo for those)

The Radiance front end Rayfront has a Windows binary called "winimage" 
that allows one to open a Radiance .pic -- excuse me, .hdr -- image and 
do exposure adjustments, do the pcond -h tonemapping, and generate 
falsecolor images which can be printed and saved in alternate formats. 
It's part of the Rayfront program and AFAIK it's not available as a 
standalone program. Details on Rayfront are located here:

Schorsch? Any chance of spinning that off into a separate 
purchase/download (or updating RF to work on newer versions of AutoCAD)?

I'm afraid to mention it, but I think the old "Desktop Radiance" package
came with winimage. If required you could download that big package,
take the winimage.exe from it, and delete the rest of the obsolete
package.

Maybe it's possible to package separately, not necessarily from
Rayfront? Or maybe my memory is just mixed up.

Oh, you're right Christopher! I think the one that shipped with Rayfront 
may have been updated but in general it's the same application. So I 
suppose one could install DR to get the winimage.exe.

I guess my memory is starting to fade...

Hi,

For Radiance images preview and analysis in Windows and Linux you can use
free tool RadDisplay <http://deluminaelab.com/en/tools.html>
It has graphical user interface, and you can make false color images with
various palettes.
You can also adjust image exposure, trace pixels, and preview either
(ir)radiance or (il)luminace values.
Current version can only save images in jpg format, but we are preparing new
version that can also save in .pic/.hdr file format.

For now it doesn't offer possibility to print images, but thank you for
idea. We'll try to implement it in next version of the program.

Hope it helps!

Marija

Hi Christopher,

If you want to avoid an installation, I have zip (winimage.exe,
falsecolor.exe and rview.exe) and uploaded to:

http://www.archidigital.arq.br/radiance/files/Winimage_falsecolor_rview.zip

Unzip them to /bin in RADIANCE folder.

regards,

vangelis

Thanks Christoph,

 

Nice work. While anything based on daylight factors is limiting, you
have qualified that every step of the way. The nice thing about this is
that you have created a process for really applying a daylight factor
approach early on in the design process. You should cross-post this to
the radiance list!

Message-ID: <49E6F07D.9080903@nus.edu.sg>

Hi,

I remember that I once have seen a paper on modeling the color gradients 
of the sky dome related to weather, time and location information, and 
if I am not completely wrong, the authors had done that work using 
Radiance. I am aware of several models for creating color gradients, but 
I could not find anything that has been applied to Radiance. Of course I 
am aware of Mark Stock's skycolor.cal, but that one takes known colors 
as an input. Does anyone else have information on the topic, how to set 
extend radiance brightness distribution by color models for the sky dome?

Thanks!!! Lars.

I am very interested in a colored sky model as well Mark. Thank-you for
offering to share! This work would be a perfect topic to present at the
Radiance workshop in November. FYI, 3ds Max Design already has the Utah
sky model implemented. It generates really impressive sunsets.

I think that there are two ways. One is to generate a mapping on a
source object, the other is "modeling the athmosphere". The second
option is quite ambitious, and may depend e..g. on photon map, spectral
rendering and other stuff (i.e. modifying mist parameters only exists in
Radzilla, not in Radiance Classic now afaik). The first option seams to
be more realistic with Radiance Classic - so the formulae would have to
be translated into a colorfunc, and the near-distance atmospheric
effects could be modeled using mist.

CU Lars.

Hi Valeria,

I suppose it depends a lot on what the film does and if data is 
available. You might want to take a look at Optics 5 from LBL as a 
starting point. It is possible if the data is in the database that you 
could build up an insulating unit and export the relevant information to 
Radiance. You could then look at using either the optics2rad or the 
glaze script to generate a valid radiance material description.

Hello Everyone,

I am involved in simulation on venetian blinds (using mkillum for 
-ab 1). We are performing comparison for two sets of blinds, one 
is the normal conventional horizontal blinds and the other one is 
the split blinds in which the the blinds system is split into 
three equal parts. when measuring illuminance values for year long 
simulations . I observe that we get large errors in values in 
December  varying from 10% to 60% ( difference in values between 
conventional and split blinds though they are at the same angle 
and same geometry) I observe these disturbances only in the month 
of December and at the sensor point closest to the window. Is this 
kind of error normal..?

Thank you

This may be a sampling issue.  Look at a plan view of the workplane  
at the problem times -- it may be that the sensor is seeing direct  
sun in one case and not in the other.  Even the tiniest change in  
geometry can result in a huge change in value if this is the case.

I converted that model to a radiance dome, i usually work with radiance 
with aesthetical purposes so i'm not sure it's phisically accurate, it 
misses the atmosferic effects because, as Lars said, i think it's 
necesary to modify radiance code. I did it as part of a 3dsmax exporter 
to rad i'm working with.
I got the main sources some time ago from a web page of the University 
of Girona in Spain (sir project), i think they created the sources based 
on some code related to the paper, i've returned to search for the 
project again but i haven't found it on the internet.

It's a windows .exe file, the program creates three data files with 
radiance colordata and outputs a radfile with the definitions of the sun 
and the sky and a white box to avoid radiance no objects error, it uses 
a calc file ssky.cal to map the data to the dome, the parameters are

                 lat Latitude (0-360)
                 long Longitude (-90,90) south to north
                 sm  Standard Meridian

                 tod Time Of Day (0.0,23.99) 14.25 = 2:15PM
                 turb  Turbidity (1.0,30+) 2-6 are most useful for clear 
days.

gesky3 lat long sm jd tod turb (gesky 43 3 3 180 10 6 >ssky.rad)

you can download: www.aisarquitectura.com/archivos/ssky.zip

When i got it there were some code missing and i could not compile it as 
it was so i modified it, but not to distribute because i don't know the 
protocols to add new code (comments, licenses ...), so i can send the 
source code to anyone who is interested in cleanning it or somebody 
could try to help me in make it better

Message-ID: <1486880850.446581240450957665.JavaMail.osg@osgjas04.cns.ufl.edu>

Hello Everyone,

I am performing simulations of Venetian blinds, for blind angles 
from  0 to 45.

The illuminance values for the blind angles of 0 degrees and 45 
degrees seem to be fine.
However,  I am getting very high illuminance values for the 15 
degree and 30 degree blind angles for the sensor point which is 
closest to the window .
The values are ranging from 8000 lux to 20,000 lux. which I guess 
are totally unreasonable results when we have blinds placed in a 
room.

These values are higher for the blind angles of 15 degrees and 30 
degrees than for the completely open blinds (zero blind angle 
gives us illuminance of 2500 lx).


Any idea why we are getting these high illuminance values for 15 
and 30 degree blind angles?

Thank you.

Could there be direct sun slipping through?

Is this for a single time of day/sun angle? My guess is that the  
steeper slat angles are letting some direct sun to strike your sensor  
points close to the window. Check the slat spacing, and the blind  
section overall.

Hello forum,

I am quite a new user to  that ray tracer. Just got a hold of the book and
installed the ray tracer in my Linux system.

Unfortunately i am getting the following error when i run one of the most
primitive commands:


****************************

The scene is rendered though in the window , but after window resize event
it does not and the error pops up in the command line


Any idea why and how to get around that error?

Hello Dave,

We tried out your 'rhino2rad' script...

Did you make it work? It does not really work on our side.

Both a folder and a file have been created.
But the folder is empty and the file just has a short header with  
three lines:
#rhino2rad;  ;#Materials:;  ;Geometry:

Is there something wrong with our system or do we have a wrong rhino  
version (engl. 4.0 evaluation)?

Thank you for a short answer...

Arne and Christoph,

I didn't expect something I pretty much threw together to get at all
popular, rather a good-enough tool when the circumstances came about.

I'll take a more careful eye to it this weekend, especially with respect to
reliability.

Thank you for the feedback, I do appreciate it. Always feel free to contact
me off-list about your issues with it.

I've never run across this error before.  It sounds like a  
communication problem between rvu and the X11 server, or an  
unsupported request.  Has anyone else seen this?  Does it happen  
every time you resize the window?

Thanks Mr Gulielmetti,

Yes its for single time and sun angle , we were trying sample 
simulations for 10, 11 am and 12 noon. I am getting these weird 
results. I have checked the geometry a number of times as well as 
all the parameters, these results seem very strange. any 
particular reason..?

Thank you

Subject: [Radiance-general] Rendering with many spectral bands and RGB
	weighting
Message-ID: <73D529D687144D77B030A34DCC1366E6@UNIVERSI047A23>

Hi,

 

Hopefully someone who has done this already can help out here..

We have been using a spectral rendering technique with radiance by splitting
our material and light source data into 27 files (81 bands) and combining
the output of the 27 rpict processes.

The assumption here is that radiance has no calculations that differ across
the 3 "RGB" values in the material and light source files.

Having searched the archives, I have found a few seemingly conflicting
pieces of information:

 

In one correspondence (from Greg Ward) it is stated that "Radiance does not
have any wavelength specific calculations".

 

However, Arne Dure has pointed us towards the source code in color.h:

#define bright(col) (CIE_rf*(col)[RED]+CIE_gf*(col)[GRN]+CIE_bf*(col)[BLU])

>>     /* As of 9-94, CIE_rf=.265074126, CIE_gf=.670114631 and

>>        CIE_bf=.064811243 */

 

Is this calculation what Greg refers to in his reply here?:

 

http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-June/000869.h
tml

 

"The only place RGB is assumed in the code is when it's 
combining primaries to get brightness for a weight test or somesuch, 
and it shouldn't affect the result much for adjacent samples, which 
should be fairly similar."

 

 

I'm not really sure what this 'weight test' is or if we should be worrying
about this. Am I correct in thinking that although this calculation may not
greatly effect the result, for maximum accuracy when spectral rendering we
should render only one waveband at a time (R=B=G) and do it 81 rather than
27 times?

 

 

Many thanks,

 

Glen Harding.

I believe I've suggested this before, but did you try visualizing  
your space at these times?  A fisheye view from the perspective of  
your sensor will usually tell you where the light is originating.

Hi Glen,

You should be fine with your 27 runs.  It's best if you interleave  
your wavelengths so that RGB still roughly corresponds to reds,  
greens, and blues, but it isn't completely critical.  The bright()  
macro is only used for determining ray weights and the like, so  
should have only a modest effect on the result.  Running individual  
wavelength calculations will not help at all.

Thanks Greg.
The interleaving sounds like a good idea.

Definitely no, I've never seen this before. If I'm gonna get an error 
from the X11 server, I don't get an rvu window at all.

A bit of googling showed that this is not an error that's unique to
rview/rvu (or Radiance in general).

I would think it's a problem with the graphics card driver (ATI was mostly
reported). You could try
to disable the 3D acceleration (won't affect rview/rvu, but other things
like blender) or use a standard
driver and see if that helps when you run rvu. If that's your problem
upgrade/downgrade to a different
driver version or replace the graphics card with another type/chip.

Thomas

Hello forum,

Thanks for the feedback on the issue.

If that is the problem of the graphics card then i think i am not on the
positive side.

I have ATI X1600 built-in my system

The free ATI drivers in X.org are actually fairly mature and stable. I 
personally would not ever go for nVidia.

If you are using a distro which default-enables Compiz desktop effects, 
such as Ubuntu, try disabling them:

System > Preferences > Appearance > Visual Effects

Ubuntu defaults to a setting which give you semi-tranparent windows, 
smooth animations when launching apps or switching desktop. It's called 
'Normal' in the control panel, When set to 'Extra', all the whizz-bang 
is enabled, leaving OSX and Windows 7 in the dust.

Try setting it to 'None', and see if your problem goes away. I had a 
similar problem on an Ubuntu box with nVidia card some time ago. rvu 
would launch, but then get stuck for up to 30 seconds. The fix described 
aboved sorted the problem.

Thanks for your reply. I switch to rvu followed with original option. but it

Message-ID: <37fac3b90904251041h26923a5awa5dff54f4d609c19@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Something worth sharing is that recently I've been working with VIPS (
http://www.vips.ecs.soton.ac.uk/index.php?title=VIPS ) which is an
*excellent* library for processing images ( I'm using the python
bindings, if your on osx, use the tarballs rather than installing it
via macports, this is an outdated release lacking radiance HDR support
). Some of the interesting features of VIPS are that concurrency comes
free, it reads / writes radiance HDR files natively, and operates
tile-based, such that unreasonably large image are processed
efficiently. Given the complete API, its an incredibly effective way
of processing HDR data.

Cheers,

-jelle

It's rather difficult to diagnose a problem when the only symptom is  
"nothing happens."  What is the command line that hangs?  What do you  
get when you type "echo $DISPLAY" ?

sorry about non technical terms. $DISPLAY shows 127.0.0.1:0.0. I tried
xclock it works. then I type in
rvu -vp 2.25 .375 1 -vd -.25 .125 -.125 -av .5 .5 .5 test.oct

it hangs there. I can see rvu in process manager but cpu usage is zero. I
read command manual. should i add -o output device option?

Thanks a lot

Hi Ren,

I see nothing wrong with your command that I can see.  I would  
suspect something with your scene file, except if oconv ran OK then  
your scene must be alright.  It does seem likely that something is  
wrong with the X11 connection, but it's impossible to debug from here  
with no error messages or symptoms.  You can kill rvu with ^\ to get  
it to dump a core file (if enabled) and find out where it's stuck  
that way, but you have to know something about programming and your  
system configuration.  I know the former but not the latter, and I  
don't have access to your machine.  This is not a common problem.   
It's the first I've heard of it.

Anyone else have suggestions?

-Greg

Sounds like an incompatibility with the X11 server.  This is the  
second such report we've seen this week, though the symptoms are  
different.  Check the thread entitled "fatal XIO - newbie" to see if  
there are any useful hints there.  Otherwise, we'll just have to wait  
to hear from others with more experience about similar problems.   
What is your exact system configuration?  It could be something as  
simple as missing fonts.

-Greg

Are these problems appearing with downloaded binaries, with binaries
from a Linux distribution, or did you compile yourself?

Hi Greg,
    it is indeed due to missing fonts. I install all the component under X11
package. it works fine so I can start exploring Radiance!

Hi,

can you still tell us what release you are working with? If you 
installed a binary release from a Linux distribution, and required fonts 
were not automatically installed, it should be reported as a dependency 
error to the package maintainer.

CU Lars.

Hello All,

Was wondering if others have noticed horizontal bands of lower  
irradiance values across the top 1/3 of the images produced from  
Radmap?  These shifts look like strong shadow lines but don't relate  
to any occluding geometry in the scene.  We seem to get these  
artifacts when using exterior views looking down onto the scene and

Hi Chris,

I can't say I've seen these before. It's also been a while since I've  
used radmap...

I have noticed that, actually I've noticed it with a custom script that
sums up CIE sunny skies, in a cumulative file, then renders irradiance
for a scene looking at direct only sun (ab 0). In my case I was looking
at an exterior aerial veiw of one building facade sited amongst other
buildings. The odd irradiance seems to occur on one of the neighboring
buildings that extends higher than all the others.

Hello All, 

Was wondering if others have noticed horizontal bands of lower
irradiance values across the top 1/3 of the images produced from Radmap?
These shifts look like strong shadow lines but don't relate to any
occluding geometry in the scene.  We seem to get these artifacts when
using exterior views looking down onto the scene and using any number of
weather files.

Thanks,

Subject: [Radiance-general] Description of complex glass systems (geometry +
	material)
Message-ID: <49F85AE5.5030606@gmail.com>


Hi everybody,

I have two questions about the description of a glass facade with a
complex glass system: one about the geometry and one concerning the
material.

1-. With the objective in daylight calculations and daylight efficiency
of materials I try to simulate, so accurate as possible, a doble glazing
facade with the next composition:

9mm laminated glass with spectrally selective interlayer -- 16mm air --
4mm float glass 

All the papers I've read describe the glass geometry as polygon as follows:

mod polygon id
0
0
3n    x1    y1    z1
    x2    y2    z2
    ...
    xn    yn    zn

 In my case, with such a glass system, would be this geometry
description of the glass right and accurate? or should I define the
radiance geometry like the contructed geometry?


2-. The second question is about the material description.
I have measured the transmittance of this doble glazing material sample
with a Spectrometer and an accessory for external measurements and
computed its transmissivity.
The complete definition of the material that I get is as follows:

mod glass id
0
0
3 rtn gtn btn


On the other hand I have exported in Radiance format from the software
Optics5 a similar glass, also with sun protection interlayer, and the
material description is much complexer. It is as follows:

void  glass       sunstop-t-silver-20_glass
0
0
3     0,205     0,222     0,239

void  BRTDfunc    sunstop-t-silver-20_front
10
      0,325     0,281     0,197
      0,188     0,203     0,219
      0 0 0
      .
0
9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

void  BRTDfunc    sunstop-t-silver-20_back
10
      0,259     0,289     0,307
      0,188     0,203     0,219
      0 0 0
      .
0
9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0


My question is if the description I did is complete and will give an
accurate calculation.
In case it is not, how can I get the hole description with the BRTD
information if I just have the glass sample and the Spektrometer to
start and this glass is not in the IGDB?

Thank you,


Marina

Hi Marina,

Yes you want to describe the glass geometry, that is one polygon 
representing the multiple layers of the physical makeup. The material is 
what should represent the behavior. If you take the output from Optics 
and run it through optics2rad you will get a single BRTDfunc material 
description. One thing to be careful of is that this is dependent on the 
correct orientation (normal) of the glass geometry. I believe that the 
normal is supposed to be pointing "into" the interior of the building. 
One way to check normal orientation in radiance is to assign 
(temporaryily) a "glow" material to the glass geometry and view it. The 
sides that are "black" are the back sides of the geometry, the sides 
that are not black are the positive normal side.

Regards,

-Jack de Valpine

Hi Marina,

1.glazing geometry

Always define glazing object as a polygon, no matter how many layers of
glass it contains in real world.
Double clear, laminated and other glazings differ only in BRTDfunc (light
transmittance and reflectance distribution function), while real glazing
width is not important here.

Note that polygon face should be oriented  towards building interior.

##########
2.glazing material
Since BRTD function for double glazing is different then for single glazing,
I don't suggest  using of simple glass material.
Procedure we use is next:
*Measure each glass layer transmittance and reflectance data. If you can
measure their r,g,b components it is good, if not use the same value for all
3 components.
or
*Export from IGDB (using Optics5 I suppose), each layer separately. And
write down transmittances/reflectances you have in BRTD functions.
Note that in Optics5 front side of the glazing is towards outside, so their
front and Radiance "front" are different.

So you should have next parameters for double glazing parameters after
measures or after export:
rf1 - interior pane front reflectance (towards the room)
rb1 - interior pane back reflectance (towards the exterior pane)
rf2 - exterior pane front reflectance (towards the interior pane)
rb2 - exterior pane back reflectance (towards the exterior)
t1 - interior pane transmittance
t2- exterior pane transmittance
r,g,b - red, green and blue color components
*For clear glass layers front and back reflectance are always the same
*
void BRTDfunc double_glazing
10
if(Rdot,cr(fr(rf1_r),ft(t1_r),fr(rf2_r)),cr(fr(rb2_r),ft(t2_r),fr(rb1_r)))
if(Rdot,cr(fr(rf1_g),ft(t1_g),fr(rf2_g)),cr(fr(rb2_g),ft(t2_g),fr(rb1_g)))
if(Rdot,cr(fr(rf1_b),ft(t1_b),fr(rf2_b)),cr(fr(rb2_b),ft(t2_b),fr(rb1_b)))
ft(t1_r)*ft(t2_r)
ft(t1_g)*ft(t2_g)
ft(t1_b)*ft(t2_b)
        0 0 0
        glaze2.cal
0
9
        0 0 0
        0 0 0
        0 0 0
*

In glazing definition function
if(Rdot,cr(fr(rf1_r),ft(t1_r),fr(rf2_r)),cr(fr(rb2_r),ft(t2_r),fr(rb1_r)))
means:
-if light is incident to the front side of the glazing then reflectance is
cr(fr(rf1_r),ft(t1_r),fr(rf2_r))
-else (light is incident to the back side) reflectance is
cr(fr(rb2_r),ft(t2_r),fr(rb1_r))

Functions for double glazing reflectance and transmittance are defined
in *glaze2.cal
*script which is provided with Radiance:
-cr(refl1, trans,refl2) - is reflectance distribution for double glazing as
function of light incident angle.  refl1 is reflectance of first glazing
pane, refl2 of the second one, and tran1 is transmittance of the first
glazing pane
-ft(t) - transmittance distribution for single glazing as function of light
incident angle. For double glazing total transmittance is ft(t1)*ft(t2)

Hope this helps,
Marija

I?m going out on a limb here but I?d suggest looking at ?dt and ?dc
parameters.

It could be that direct source testing stops earlier than you?d like for
unobstructed surfaces.  I expect that a scene with ~4000 suns should have
higher parameters for direct sampling anyway.

This seems to make some sense. Anyone have a guess of whether it would
be more productive to set -dt 0 or -dc 1 in order to ensure no sources
are missed? In the man page those two settings seem to lead to avoidance
of estimations in the direct calculation.

Actually Francesco has always advised that -dt be set to 0 when using 
radmap skies because missing an entire sun could introduce a pretty 
large error. Maybe this is why I've never seen these artifacts before.

Thank you all.   Paying closer attention to the -dt and -dc parameters  
makes a lot of sense.  Sure enough, setting -dt 0 and -dc 1 improves  
the results and  fixes the artifact problem.

I just had occasion to download the original Radiance SIGGRAPH paper  
from RadSite.  Distressingly, it turns out that some of the files are  
either damaged or in now-unreadable formats.  I cannot untar the  
PostScript version of the paper at <http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/papers/sg94.1/paper.tar.Z 
 >--I'm not sure if this is a format problem or a damaged file.  And,  
it turns out, figure 12, <http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/papers/sg94.1/fig12.gif 
 > has also become unreadable.

Anyone know who maintains the site at this time?  I have copied the  
webmaster link on this e-mail, as well, but I wonder if anyone is  
actually reading that mailbox.

Hi Randolph,

I just got your earlier e-mail, which you sent to my greg@anyhere.com  
account.  I'm not checking that account regularly, as the server  
seems to have been claimed by a spambot and 99% of the e-mails on  
there are now viagra offers.

The paper is fortunately archived on the RwR CD-ROM, and I'm  
converting it to PDF for the website.  I'll let you know when it's  
ready.

Cheers,
-Greg

OK -- took some work, but the whole thing squeezed down to a 1 MByte  
PDF, which is now linked in at:

	http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/papers/sg94.1/paper.html

(You may need to reload the page to clear your cache.)

The figures are still out of order, but I can't be bothered to fix that.

Cheers,
