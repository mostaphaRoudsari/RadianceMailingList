Although I think most questions were answered already - here's a hint about
RAYPATH: It is not in the environment by default, but by default the
directory, where the radiance materials are located, is used.
So running the examples works well without any changes.

Cheers,

So of course I ran into that problem of having perfectly black surfaces 
in my field of view. If ever anyone needs a way to get around this, here 
is my solution for now, using nothing but primitive text processing (and 
I am sure that the grep line could be written nicer):

N_PIXELS=`vwrays fisheye.hdr | grep -v -c "0.00000e+00 0.00000e+00 
0.00000e+00 0.00000e+00 0.00000e+00 0.00000e+00"`

So I feed my image (fisheye.hdr) into vwray, which will produce 
viewpoint/direction vectors for each pixel. For pixels that are outside 
the view, it writes out three times zero. Grep -c counts those, but grep 
-v -c counts the lines NOT containing the six zero expressions. And this 
is the number of pixels inside my image's view.

Maybe someone finds it useful one day.

CU Lars.

Message-ID: <4989732A.2040600@nus.edu.sg>

Hi,

I am completely stuck with my attempt to get some rather generic 
diffusor into my scene. I have a room which is lid by a light pipe, and 
to simulate this I use radiance 3.7 with the pmap extension. Everything 
works rather fine. Now I wanted to put some diffusing body under that 
light pipe, and I chosed the trans material to do so. The material 
definition I used should result in a simple diffuse transmitting box:

void trans genericDiffusor
0
0
7 1 1 1 0 0 .5 0

And I applied this to a box:

!genbox genericDiffusor Diffusor60x60 .3 .3 .01 | xform -t -.3 -.3 0

The opening is .6x.6m and centred at the origin, so that my diffusor 
covers only part of it. I want to see the effect of the material... And 
the effect is - somewhat unexpected. The "diffusor"-box appears black in 
my rendering. So is there anything completely wrong in my scene? Is 
there anything I got wrong about trans and surface normals, is it the 
combination of trans and pmap?

CU Lars.

Sorry... this was complete nonsense, I had the modifier overwritten by

Subject: [Radiance-general] Cutting a cylinder,
	or modeling smooth geometry...
Message-ID: <498BE4F6.70600@nus.edu.sg>

Hi,

I am running into problems due to the lack of csg in radiance. I need to 
accurately model a tube with a very specular material, which is bent. 
The real tube is produced by cutting a cylinder under 22.5 degree and 
assembling it, leading to a nice 45degree angle with one ellyptical 
edge. As I am not able to cut a cylinder geometry in radiance, I have 
modeled it as a mesh, but the specularity leads to visible edges.

I have been sonsidering several solutions so far:

1) Using antimatter to cut away parts of the cylinder would probably not 
work, as the second cylinder, which also has to be cut, would lead to 
two overlapping antimatter volumes.

2) Refining the mesh would result in huge geometry, as the segments 
would become thinner while keeping their length, this would lead to a 
real worst case for oconv. Also to make the edges disappear, I would 
have to get into dimensions where one facet should not take much more 
then one pixel in the final rendering.

3) Using "smooth" surface normals would lead to an visual improvement. 
But I have my doubts if these would be considered for photon mapping and 
especially caustics? In my setup, the pipe ends with a diffusor 
(currently modeled as a box modified by a rather generic trans 
material). I would expect caustic effects to become visible caused by a 
round tube geometry with very high specularity.

4) The last option I see is using a cylinder object with a mixfunc 
modifier and a simple cal file containing just the line

condition=if(Pz-Px,1,0);

to cut my geometry in 45 degrees, using void to get parts of the 
geometry invisible. Would that work with overlapping geometries (which 
would still exist, even if invisible), and would it be relieable with 
the pmap extension? The main disadvantage here is that I would have to 
maintain an extra set of geometry for radiance, while I could use 
converters to import from other programs so far.

This is modelled as a mesh with normals.  It was just a practice piece
I did when developing my mesh generator.  The ends are square but could
be angled.

I am using raypcalls library, and i was wondering if there is any way to 
stop the calculation without waiting to the rays in the queue to finish 
and discard (ray_pdone), i mean, there are sometimes that you have high 
rendering parameters and the first few rays are very slow, so i would 
like  to "kill"  the processes or something similar ...

Hi Ignacio,

This thread probably belongs on the development group, where I'm  
cross-posting.  Please respond from that list.

There is no call to explicitly kill child processes in raypcalls, but  
you could add one.  It would also be possible to modify the ray_pclose 
() call to explicitly kill its children rather than waiting for them  
to return after end-of-input.  We wouldn't be able to report status,  
but it would be unusual (and probably irrelevant) for an error to  
occur during process termination, anyway.

In a command-line program, using Control-C normally kills all  
processes in a group, and so would lead to early termination for  
children without the wait.  In the latest version of rvu, rather than  
killing the child processes when the user begins input, I take their  
input while the children crank away in the background, then process  
the user command after waiting for the remaining rays.  Normally, the  
delay is not noticeable with this approach.

Best,
-Greg

Hi Lars,

Your idea of applying a mixfunc is clever, and I believe it should  
work, at least in Radiance "classic".  I have no idea if material  
mixing is supported in the photon mapping extension, however.

Since I don't have access to a Linux machine, I was wondering if anyone

shed some light on this? 

Thanks,

Greetings,

Using Radiance on a virtual machine and I am trying to run the scene0 tutorial.

$ rview -vf camera.vp test.oct

After entering this, the camera.vp file opens up in text editor and no image appears on the screen.
I had thought that things were installed proper because it has come this far but I am not for certain.

Your assistance is greatly appreciated.  Thank you.

rview has been renamed to rvu, as several other binaries, because of
naming conflicts with other tools of various, mainly Linux,
distributions. Have a look at the distribution-specific documentation,
which should be located in /usr/shared/doc/radiance-*, there may be more

Good luck, Lars.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Assign measurement grids for rtrace automatically
Message-ID: <828856.1728.qm@web90503.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Dear all, 

I am looking for a way to assign measurement grids on the surfaces of Radiance geometries?automatically.??RSHOW written by? Peter Apian-Bennewitz is the closest I can find.? Could anybody give some other suggestions? Thanks a lot. 

Cheers, 
Kam

Kevin.

'rview' in Radiance has been renamed to 'rvu'.
The documentation (mostly old) does not reflect this,
though.

Check that you have an 'rvu' command on your
system and substitute the two whenever you see an
'rview' related to Radiance.

If you don't have 'rvu' you should update your
Radiance version. If that's not possible use the
full path (something like '/usr/local/bin/rview').


Regards,
Thomas

I never tried evalglare on Windows. I was not even aware that it 
existed. On Linux, it comes as an archive, and the documentation is 
included as a pdf document.

There is no GUI for evalglar, as it simply processes rendered image 
files. Did you try if it is in your PATH already by just typing 
'evalglar' at the command line? How did you install it?

Subject: [Radiance-general] mkillum illuminating outside?
Message-ID: <499290B6.80703@nus.edu.sg>

Hi,

I just got some surprising results from mkillum.

I have a very basic set-up, that consists of a test-room facing a wall 
with a small window. I put a koffer around the open side of the room, 
and define these surfaces as illums using mkillum. In the next step, I 
display only the scene illuminated by the mkillum-generated illum - the 
sky dome that was used to generate the illum has been removed here, to 
have only the contribution by the illum visible.

Now the illum replaces the indirekt contribution into the room, and this 
looks ok. But - the illum also illuminates the outside geometry in my 
case. So I have a bright area on the wall opposite of my test room. This 
is also clearly visible from inside (the sky dome has been switched on 
again in that case).

I never came to think about it, but this would mean that in all those 
cases, where we place an illum inside a fenestration, the fenestrations 
inner surfaces will appear brigther then they should be, right?

CU Lars.

Sorry, this was a stupid mistake of mine. When I replaced the polygon 
surface that I had been using before by a !gensurf-line, I ended up with 
a wrong surface normal. This made my illum become oriented to the 
outside world. As the other surfaces where still facing inwards, the 
culprit surface still got enough light from the sides to illuminate the 
opposite wall. I only found this when I switched to the light modifier 
type using mkillums l+, because than the surface appeared completely 
black when seen from inside (the illum being not visible itself makes 
this kind of debugging more difficult, and I was 100% sure that the 
orientation was ok because I had tested it before - but than there had 
been the polygon).

So, this is my second non-problem reported to the list, sorry for 
messing up your mail boxes...

Hi Lars,

Nice that I slept through this one, too...  Your debugging tips are  
helpful.  Another way to determine whether you are looking at the  
back or front of a surface is in rvu, which reports the first surface  
hit (even if it's invisible) and tells you back or front.  This is  
only for materials that care which side you hit, like lights, illums,  
dielectric, etc.  Plastic and metal won't let you know.  The only way  
to tell for these surfaces is to turn backface visibility off with - 
bv0.  This can cause your scene to look a bit confused, so I only  
recommend it as a last resort.

Best,
-Greg

Hi Lars,

One thing that we do to confirm orientation is to test the relevant 
geometry by assigning a glow material. Front will "glow" back will be black.

If you're using AutoCAD, you can select the element and then step 
through the vertex order in the properties dialog box.  There is also an 
autoLISP routine floating out there on the intertubes that draws an 
arrow indicating the normal, and has a flip function too.  I realize 
this is modeling tool-specific, and is one step removed from the actual 
Radiance scene description, but I mention it anyway, just because.  =8-)

Message-ID: <54062c4e0902131757w2ed9dd34od297860c2ed0ea7d@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have just uninstalled Desktop Radiance and installed the MinGW version on
my computer (Windows OS). I have been informed that this is the latest
version of Radiance for Windows OS. Unfortunately I now have trouble reading
images exported from Ecotect.

When I export the Ecotect example file "RADIANCE_example.eco" I am able to
see a rendered view of the space in the image viewer, but I cannot run any
of the options for the information overlay (e.g. contour lines, false color,
daylight factors etc.) and get the message "RGBE read error"
When exporting the file from Ecotect, I noticed that when checking whether
Radiance is functional, the exporter returned a message saying that the
application "rview" is missing from the directory. Could this be the
problem? If so, what are alternative ways for evaluating the radiance image?

I have uploaded an image of the error message to the Autodesk discussion
forum:
http://discussion.autodesk.com/forums/message.jspa?messageID=6124907#6124907

Thanks,

Krystyna

Hi,

the subject-line of this mail is not very helpful. What kind of file do
you want to export from Ecotect? I try to understand what you wrote, and
it seams that you want to use the image processing tools of Radiance on
images generated in Ecotect, is this the case? I also do not know which
"image viewer" you refer to, the only image viewer in Radiance that I am
aware of is ximage, and it offers no such things like your information
overlay functionality, as this is done by filters in Radiance. So I
guess you are using other software here, not Radiance.

Can you please find out some details about what kind of data you want to
process using which Radiance tools?

Good luck, Lars.

Unfortunately 'falsecolor' (which is the master tool behind most
of these overlays) is not distributed with the MinGW binaries
because it is a CSH-script that does not run on Windows. Therefore
the ImageViewer bundled with Ecotect can not generate this type
of analysis.

There is another picture viewer around which is based on
Python and that seems to be the best option to create
falsecolor images on Windows at the moment:

Raddisplay - http://www.deluminaelab.com/en/tools.html

It requires some time to setup, though.

The application 'rview' is now called 'rvu' and AFAIK it has
not been ported to Windows.


There have been some significant changes to the Radiance
applications since Desktop Radiance has been released. This
affects mostly the rendering process, though. The image format
is still the same and you should be able to open a 'new'
image in the old 'rview'. You could try to copy the missing
applications from your DR installation over to the MinGW
installation and see if that solves your problem.

Thomas

Hi all,

I have fixed this same problem, instaling the old Desktop Radiance and
copyng from it the *rview.exe* and *winimage.exe* files to my new radiance
3.9 binaries folder. It works very fine.

Take care to install radiance in a folder with a name without spaces, it?s
sound silly but it?s important!

(eg: c:/radiance)

This might be useful, refer to the following site:
http://irc.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ie/lighting/daylight/daysim_e.html

On the right under the Column click on the 'Getting Started' PDF link.

Navigate to page 26 (headed Radiance), steps 27-37 provide a walk through of how Ecotect exports to Radiance and the built in Radiance viewer that comes with Ecotct to create false-color images.

Step 37 'Info' box describes the RGBE error and suggests a possible way to fix it.

Step 30a shows the procedure to set-up Ecotect to export to Radiance and how to point to correct directory.

Square One/AutoDesk recommends using Ecotect with Desktop Radiance.   
It is old, but if it is still available, it will resolve these  
issues.  Their instructions--I hope they still work--are here: <http://squ1.org/wiki/Installing_Radiance_Tutorial

"rview"; it is unlikely that you have "vi" on your Windows system to

I would like to thank everyone for their advice. It looks like the problem
has been resolved and that it was not related to the fact that the rview.exe
application does not come with the version of Radiance I am using (MinGW
Radiance Installer for Windows (HEAD snapshot 2008-04-17) available for
download at http://www.radiance-online.org/).

 I had to reset my Radiance directory within the 'image viewer' program in
order to be able to apply any of the overlays. Below is an excerpt from an
NRC document explaining how to get started with Ecotect-Radiance-DAYSIM
(available at http://irc.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ie/lighting/daylight/daysim_e.html),
in which specific reference is made to the issue I experienced:

 Please note: The first time you are trying to generate a falsecolor image
you might get an error message stating "RGBE read error". If this is the
case, you have to reset your Radiance directory within the 'image viewer'
program above under OPTIONS >> SETTINGS (see also Step 30.a).

 The NRC document describes how to import/export files from
Ecotect/Radiance/DAYSIM. It is very helpful, although parts of it may be
slightly outdated.  For example, I think that the link provided for the
Radiance download (
http://www.arch.mcgill.ca/prof/reinhart/software/Radiance3P7forWindows.zip)
may refer to an older version of Radiance.

 I am keeping my fingers crossed things will run smoothly from now on!

Message-ID: <a3b82cc90902160442q3b915fadq84fd166a2d53de4a@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

As per the installation specification in the README of Gendaylit, I tried to
edit the COPTS of the makefile, but it is giving errors and the compilation
is failing. The default COPTS is -Ae -g. Will it work with the gcc of linux.
I had specified '-o' COPTS for linux and it says the undefined reference to
the trigonometric functions and to 'main'. Is it necessary to use a HP-UX
gcc compiler? Will it work if I use the ILP32 hp-gcc?

Thank you
Chandrayee

Hi Chandrayee.

You can use gcc. I just compiled it on Mac OS with gcc
4.01. I didn't use any flags ('CCOPTS=') and set 'CC=gcc'.

I always got an error when compiling it. Today I looked
this up and found that there is a macro fropen() that
conflicts with the definition in the gensky source file
fropen.c (on Mac OS X BSD at least). I renamed 'fropen'
to 'fzopen' in fropen.c and gendaylit.c and it worked!

You may also include 'string.h' to avoid a warning
about strcpy.

Hth and servus,

Thomas

you should use the version from our Web-site. It should work without any

Yep. Works out of the box.
The makefile targets need some adjustments, though.

Glad to see all the downloads available again.

Hello

Thank you so much. I have also removed the flags and set cc to gcc. Now
there is a problem with the function fropen in fropen.c and also it says
that the declaration of the built in function strcpy is incompatible. I have
changed fropen to fzopen , even then the problem with the function line is
still there.

Thank you
Chandrayee

Hello

Thanks. I have installed the gendaylit from the fraunhofer ise website. I am
getting an error in three function lines og gendaylit and in all cases the
warning says ' assignment makes pointer from integer', but the compilation
is done. Is it necessary to fix this? If so, how can I do that?
Thank you

Hi,

these are just some warnings - you can ignore them.

Message-ID: <694e132c0902161753k258bd0e9yff8a79b987753991@mail.gmail.com>

I had a day off, and I decided to try to make another Radiance front
end / exporter, this time with Rhino. Rhino is very popular with
architects, and is the second result in a Yahoo search for NURBS
(third in Google).

It is written in RhinoScript and exports any file, by layer,
containing surfaces capable of being opened in Rhino as Radiance
geometry. The file should be saved by Rhino first.

This is early, early alpha, by the way. I'm looking for feedback and
app utility. Many more features will follow.

Hello

Thank you for the help. The Gendaylit is installed properly now. Actually I
am facing some errors while trying to export scene from ESP-r to RADIANCE
for which I was suggested to install Gendaylit. I have installed the
components of Gendaylit in the default target locations as given in the
makefile. My RADIANCE is also working properly. But still I am getting error
in ESP-r as 'problem detected in opening filename.rif and
filename_day_f.sky. Is there any problem regarding the location of
Gendaylit? The binaries of RADIANCE are in /usr/local/bin while the
libraries are in /usr/local/lib/ray. But the default location of the
Gendaylit components is /usr/local/radiance. Could this be a problem? Do I
have to reset the environment variable PATH for Gendaylit?

Thank you.

The simplest solution is to edit the makefile and
change the installation locations to your existing
Radiance installation (binary and libraries). Then
run 'make install' again in the source directory.

Alternatively you can extend your RAYPATH and
PATH to include the location of gendaylit and its
*.cal files.

There is no risk of overwriting existing
files so I would recommend the first option;

Thomas

Message-ID: <527f2f7a0902180230w6476dcd7p4a7d5314fc9c0ea4@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
I'm trying to automate the calculation of illuminance values inside an
office, during 4 different days of each month of the year. I've saved
the script below as venezia.csh and then I've written chmod u+x
venezia.csh, and finally ./venezia.csh.

#! /bin/csh
set opzioni = (-ab 7 -aa .1 -ad 2048 -as 1024 -ar 512)
foreach mo (1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12)
foreach da (7 14 21 28)
foreach hh (4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21)
gensky -a 45.50 -o -12.33 -m -15 $mo":"$da":"$hh -u -g 0.2 > sky.rad
oconv sky.rad office.rad glaze70.rad mirr_ss.rad > model.oct

$mo.$da.$hh.V.mss.dat
end
end
end

The problem is : use error - bad month, oconv: sky.rad - empty-file
and, finally, missing name for redirect. Does anybody know how to make
it work?
Thanks in advance,
Valeria

Valeria

The syntax for gensky is

     gensky month day hour:minute [anything else]

In your script you create

     gensky -a 45.5 -o 12.33 -m -15 month:day:hour -u -g 0.2

which is not accepted by gensky. Use the line

     gensky $mo $da $hh":00" -a 45.50 -o -12.33 -m -15 -u -g 0.2 >  
sky.rad

instead of your command. I assume that the CSH syntax
otherwise is correct. I have not checked that the output
of $hh":00" returns something like "13:00".

I also noticed that you use a uniform sky here (-u).
This is not realistic sky distribution and only appropriate
in specialist cases. If you want a "standard" sky you should
use "-c" to create an CIE overcast sky (probably not very
accurate for Venice either - I'm sure you get some sun there.).

Regards,
Thomas

Hi,

you must first specify month day hour (without ':' in between!!!), than 
the options (just type gensky, it will show you the possible ways to 
call it).

gensky $mo $da $hh -a 45.50 -o -12.33 -m -15 -u -g 0.2 > sky.rad

Should do the job.

However, instead of your foreach loops, you can use the radiance tool 
'cnt', which counts thru an array, combined with rcalc and awk, to write 
a shell script that will do the calculation:

cnt 12 4 18 | rcalc -e '$1=1+$1;$2=(1+$2)*7;$3=$3+4' | awk '{ print 
"gensky "$1, $2, $3" -a 45.50 -o -12.33 -m -15 -u -g .2 > sky.rad; oconv 
sky.rad office.rad glaze70.rad mirr_ss.rad > model.oct"; }' > skys.bash

As you see, I did not write the rtace part - as I am too lazy to do all 
the escaping work for awk. Still, it is just a proposal to do this in an 
one-liner ;-)

Good luck, CU Lars.

Subject: [Radiance-general] diffuse + specular > total reflectance?
Message-ID: <499BF260.9090600@nus.edu.sg>

Hi,

as this may be because of some standards that I am not aware of, I have 
a question about a record of material properties that I do not 
understand yet.

I have a high reflective surface, and the manufacturer gives me these:

reflectance specular   60 degree: 82
reflectance diffuse:                        10
reflectance total (ASTM E1651):   86

If I add 82 and 10 I get 92 > 86 for the total reflectance. So what does 
this mean, are the values related to the way the reflectance is measured 
and calculated using different procedures according to standards?

CU Lars.

Valeria,

If the following material and source descriptions are *not* in your  
other .rad, files, then you will only have a description for the sun.

skyfunc glow skyglow
0
0
4 1 1 1 0

skyglow source sky
0
0
4 0 0 1 180

skyfunc glow groundglow
0
0
4 1 1 1 0

groundglow source ground
0
0
4 0 0 -1 180

If that is the case, put the lines above into a file called, say,  
sky_glow.rad and include it in the oconv command, e.g:
oconv sky.rad sky_glow.rad office.rad glaze70.rad mirr_ss.rad >  
model.oct
Also, there's a typo here:
rtrace -w -h -opv -I+ $opzioni model.oct < office_sensor.pts > |rcalc - 
e '$1=$1;$2=$2;$3=179*(.265074126*$4+.670114631*$5+.064811243*$6)' >  
$mo.$da.$hh.V.mss.dat
I'm assuming this is all one line, in any case you don't need the ">"  
redirection before the pipe to rcalc, just delete it.
A presto!

Hi Lars,

I think that what you want to do is:

    <total reflectance> - <diffuse reflectance> = <specular reflectance>

    thus

    86 - 10 = 76

The specular reflectance that is provided is for a measurement at 60 
degrees incidence, if I understand this correctly.

You mean that, while at 60 degree the specular reflectance is higher,
the average specular reflectance over all angles of incidence should be
the expected value of 76%? I try to get what the values really mean... a
desperate attempt without really knowing what had been measured.

Thanks! CU Lars.

Thank you John,
I forgot the glow description! I've noticed that without the glow
description I have only the sun description and it results 0 lux all
the time.

Subject: [Radiance-general] vta 2 vth
Message-ID: <499C5427.404@u.washington.edu>


Hi Greg (and everybody in the group),

I have used the formula Greg provided for a previous discussion 
(http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-January/005644.html) 
to convert an angular projection to hemispherical fisheye projection.

I am getting bizarre results. So, just to see what is going on, I have 
generated an overcast sky with vta option (-vta -vp 1.000 1.000 0.000 
-vd 0.000 0.000 1.000 -vu -1 0 0 -vh 180 -vv 180 -vs 0 -vl 0)

I have used your formula:

pcomb -e 'sq(x):x*x' \
	 -e 'ar=190/2*PI/180*sqrt(sq(2/xmax*x-1)+sq(2/ymax*y-1))' \
	-e 'cf=WE*sq(190*PI/180*2/(xmax+ymax))*if(ar-PI/2,0,if(ar-.01,cos(ar) 
*sin(ar)/ar,1))' \
	-e 'lo=cf*li(1)'  input.hdr > corrected.hdr

(I used 181 degrees instead of 190)

and I was hoping to have an image similar to what I would have generated 
using the vth option (-vth -vp 1.000 1.000 0.000 -vd 0.000 0.000 1.000 
-vu -1 0 0 -vh 180 -vv 180 -vs 0 -vl 0).

After the correction, my luminance values dropped significantly (2500 
cd/m2 dropped to 4.3). You can find the original and corrected images 
at:  http://faculty.washington.edu/inanici/vta/

Any ideas why I am having difficulties with this? Thanks in advance...

Cheers,
Mehlika

Hi Mehlika,

what exactly do you want to achieve? The command you quoted from Greg's
mail does not change the projection (or view-type). It corrects for the
weigth of luminances according to their angle from the optical axis (or
the view-direction of the sensor) when contributing to the illuminance
of a point, which is also known as the cosine law. So you can expect a
fall-off. Do you want to change the projection of an existing image?

Lars.

Hi Lars,

Yes, I would like to change the projection of the existing image from an 
equi-angular to hemispherical fisheye, if that is doable. But my 
intention was similar to your motive. I have used hemisherical fisheye 
images in the past to calculate illuminance at the camera point 
(averaging luminance within the circular area and multiplying by pi). 
Since the physical fisheye lenses have equi-angular (or equi distant) 
projections (not cosine corrected hemispherical fisheye projections), I 
am trying to calculate illuminance from a HDR photograph taken with a 
fisheye lens.

Thanks,
Mehlika

Hi Mehlika,

I think the output of this command was originally intended for the  
"total" command to add up illuminance in lux.  Thus, the pixel values  
get added up and divided by the total number of above-hemisphere  
pixels, which you don't want to do in this case.  I guess what you're  
trying to do instead is reweight your pixels according to the cosine,  
but it doesn't really make sense to me.  If you actually want to  
change the projection rather than creating a reweighted image, you  
should use pinterp, instead:

	pinterp -vf input.hdr -vth -x 1024 -y 1024 -ff input.hdr 1 > hemi.hdr

(Just saw Lars' response, which is along similar lines to this...)

If you still want to go ahead with the command, you can modify it  
thusly to get more what you say you're expecting:

pcomb -e 'sq(x):x*x' \
	 -e 'ar=190/2*PI/180*sqrt(sq(2/xmax*x-1)+sq(2/ymax*y-1))' \
	-e 'cf=WE/le(1)*if(ar-PI/2,0,if(ar-.01,cos(ar) *sin(ar)/ar,1))' \
	-e 'lo=cf*li(1)'  input.hdr > corrected.hdr

Best,
-Greg

Thanks Gerg and Lars. pinterp seems to be the solution!

Hi Lars,Just wondering, do you have a roughness value (RMS) or equivalent from the manufacturer?If not, could it be possible that the 60-degree measurement is used to define the roughness value? The higher value (82) seems like a way to define the BRDF.i.e. BRDF(theta-i, phi-i, theta-r, phi-r) = 82/76 = 1.079You'd need to know (manufacturer definition)what the actual angle configurations (theta and phi) are for the 60-degree measurement, then working backwards using the Radiance equation, you'd get the roughness (RMS) value.for example, if both angles are zero, roughness = 0.272.if both angles are 30 (60-degree split evenly), roughness = 0.292 What exactly is the material? If it is more smooth than rough (polished metal rather than plastic-ky) then obviously my guess is wrong. cheers,YC Huang  I think that what you want to do is:

    <total reflectance> - <diffuse reflectance> = <specular reflectance>

    thus

    86 - 10 = 76

The specular reflectance that is provided is for a measurement at 60 
degrees incidence, if I understand this correctly.

Message-ID: <694e132c0902182104h66f7fc45j952fd5cb1575b538@mail.gmail.com>

Here's a brain teaser,

So when you stretch an image of the sky coordinate grid onto a sky dome,
then look at it in a hemispherical view, does anybody know what the
mathematical equations (sin, cos, etc. functions) for the "former
longitudes" (curved "vertical" lines) are on the projected 2D circle? Quite
an odd question, I'm thinking.

Here's an image to get you started, showing half the sky, latitude lines,
"former longitude" lines, ground, and a sun, projected onto a 2D circle:

Hi David,

I did not really get what you really want to achieve. What kind of a sky 
coordinate grid are you refering to? It looks like you want to create a 
projection of the longitudonal lines of a hemisphere, right? What 
projection do you refer to when saying hemispherical view? What I see on 
the image looks a lot like a parralel proction of the dome, so the 
lines's coordinated could be calculated from spherical coordinates, 
obtained from the horizontal and vertical angle and radius, and ignoring 
the third coordinate (for the image you just need the two dimensions), 
transfered into cartesian coordinates. If you write down the formulas 
for this, you should be able to combine to something much simpler 
describing the parabolic curves. But I am not sure if I really got your 
intention yet.

So do you want a parallel projection of a hemisphere with longitudonal 
lines?

Lars.

Hi,

thank you for the reply! The material is an aluminium surface finish
with coatings. I do not know about the roughness yet, as it was not
provided. I know that the total reflectance was determined using an
integrating sphere, and at an angle of 30 degree (whatever this really
means in detail - where is the angle in this measurement?), the specular
reflectance was measured according to ISO 7668.

As far as I understand, the routine is to point a light source at the
sample point under the indicated angle (which is given as the angle
between surface normal and the line between the sample point and the
light source. On the opposite side, the sensor is pointed at the same
sample point. 60 degrees is a standard for aluminium measurements
according to the ISO 7668.

As the surface roughness influences the measurements, the term used here
is gloss (a nice explanation is found at wikipedia
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloss_(material_appearance) ). If someone
can share a nice definition of the difference between gloss and specular
reflectance it would be highly appreciated ;-)

And I have to read a bit before I can follow you about how to determine
the roughness.

CU Lars.

David.

For a parallel projection all you have to do is take
the circle equation (x^2 + y^2 = r^2) for the outmost
line (+/-90 deg long, stays a circle) and 'squeeze' it
with the sin of the longitude. I assume that 0 deg long
is in the centre of the image.

A perspective projection is not as simple because
you have to take distance from centre and z-value
into account. It's still a linear equation, though.

Regards,
Thomas

Hi Lars,

 

Unless I'm missing something, there is no real convention for specular or glossy (in the graphics field), but for Radiance, I think it means the same thing. The degree of rapid fall off from the mirror direction (what we call specular/glossy reflection) is characterized by the roughness of the material. I suspect you're already familar with this. In the blinn-phong model, the exponent, alpha, is that roughness.

 

But in Radiance, blinn-phong is not good enough. For physical accurarcy, Ward developed an emipircal BRDF model:

 

http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/papers/sg92/paper.html

 

the 2nd part of Equation 4 on page 168 is essentially how Radiance models specular/glossy reflections. There is additional consideration for steradians subtended, but let's not go there.

 

the exp[-tan2(delta)/alpha2] part of the expression determines how fast the falloff is from the mirror direction. This is equivalent to a cos curve raised to some power, in the range [0-1], and is only a factor. In other words, it describes the relative distribution of radiance reflected at different angles. The rest of the expression in eq4 is just to normalize/scale the "magnitude" of the expression so that it is physically accurate as a BRDF.

 

For shiny surfaces, the BRDF at mirror directions can be upwards of 15.

 

Going back to your problem, the reflectance total (ASTM) and reflectance specular only describes how the incoming Radiance is divided (10% incoming energy is diffusely reflected, 76% is specularly reflected). This information is not complete since you have no idea at this point how the energy to be specularly reflected should be distributed. Do all of the light go out in the mirror direction? Is there *some* specular scattering? The distribution is defined by the roughness of the material, which, for Radiance, is RMS slope of surface facets.

 

What I was guessing in my previous email was that the reflectance specular 60-degree being 82%, descibes the solution to equation(4) as evaluated at a particular angle, and thus might actually be a way of defining the roughness. 

 

Imagine a function fn(x) = (cos x)^n

 

n is the rougness we need, but this is not measured directly. Instead, we are given the value of the function at x=60, say fn(60)=0.5 . We can then work backwards and get n=1! That is the general idea. 

 

Cheers,

YC Huang

 

p.s. Are you working with Stephen Wittkopf?

I just tested this conversion with a few projections and
I got an error message when I tried to use -vts (the shiny
new stereographic projection). Now, I know I have a patchy
system here and some libs might be outdated but does pinterp
need an update to support this?

BTW: I think this use of pinterp is worth mentioning in the

Hi Thomas,

I just gave it a go with the latest HEAD, and it seems to be working  
just fine.  I don't know what might be amiss with your installation,  
but the main disto. seems OK.

It's a good idea to add an example of this to the pinterp man page.   
Will do so for the next release.

Best,
-Greg

Subject: [Radiance-general] modeling a fresnel lense diffuser
Message-ID: <499E85CD.1030505@nus.edu.sg>

Hi,

I have to model a diffuser which consists of an array of fresnel lenses, 
and I want to be able to use the pmap extension. Is there any other way 
then modeling the lenses' geometry (or its equivalent full lenses')? As 
far as I got it, I cannot model it in prism2, as the distance from the 
lense center is not available when calculating the outgoing ray. Generic 
brtf is not supported with pmap.

I guess the best way to determine the properties of the lense is a laser 
pointer, millimeter-gridded paper and moving the pointer parallel to the 
lense surface, right? Or is there another way recommended for those of 
us who do not have a full equipped lab at home?

I have that strange feeling that I am leaving Radiance's application 
focus right here, but this is something quite relevant. These diffusers 
are commonly used with ligh redirecting systems, and these systems can 
be (and are) modeled using Radiance+pmap.

CU... Lars.

Hi,

I've just uploaded radiance 3R9+20090211-1 to Debian/unstable (== based on the
CVS HEAD from 2009-02-11).
As usual it will take a day or two until the packages are built for all
architectures, but amd64 should be available after the next dinstall run.
The package will hit testing in >=10 days, then I'll upload it to backports.org,
too, so it can be installed in Lenny. If somebody needs packages for Etch,
please let me know.

Cheers,

Hi all,

Gendaylit seems to spit out an uncommented line as part of the outpu:

    gendaylit : the actual zenith radiance....

This results in output that cannot be run, unless a comment "#" is added 
in. Is there some reason for this? I have added a "#" in the src and 
recompiled to remove this.

Thanks,

Hello Everyone,

I am simulating a simple office space 10' X 18' with a 6' X 6' 
window, and the automated Venetian blinds. I am trying to compare 
Illuminance values for two models:
1.        In the base case the slats have the same tilt angle at 
one point of time ("conventional control").
2.         In the prototype model, the blinds are divided into 
three sections: Top , Middle and Bottom Blinds, each of equal 
dimensions ("splitcontrol"). In each section blinds can have the 
different slat tilt angle.

For pilot testing I tested  conventional control for  0, 45 and 90 
degrees and split control for 0, 45, and 90 degrees, too (i.e. I 
kept the same tilt angle in each section of the split blinds just 
for the pilot testing  and the result  comparison purpose).

The results that I obtained show variation in the values of 
Illuminance obtained for these two models (results difference 
ranges from 10-150%) although the results should be the same.

Conventional Blind
genblinds whitealum main 0.0125 1.82 1.88 195 90 |xform -rz 90 -t 
2.71 0.05 0.8>conventional90.rad

Split Blinds

genblinds whitealum main 0.0125 1.82 0.63 66 90 |xform -rz 90 -t 
2.71 0.05 2.06>66-1-90.rad

2.71 0.05 0.8>66-3-90.rad



I am using the following script to obtain the results.

#!/bin/csh -f

set mon=01
set month=Illuminancesplit90
set day=01
set coord=(-a 30.00 -o 82.35 -m 84)
rm $month.out
while($day<32)
foreach hr(08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17)
echo "hr=$hr"
set skypar=($mon $day $hr +i $coord)
echo "$month/$day/$hr">>$month.out
oconv -i 66-1-2-3-90.oct '\!gensky '"$skypar" sky.rad>hr.oct
rtrace -h -I -ab 1 -ad 4096 -as 128 -av .02 .02 .02 
hr.oct<mainsamples.inp|rcalc -e 
'$1=47.4*$1+120*$2+11.6*$3'>>$month.out
#`./newglares.csh hr.oct $month.out`
echo " ">>$month.out
rm hr.oct
end
@ day++
echo "day=$day"
end

Considering the fact that we use the same room model, same window 
settings and blinds, why is there such variation in the values of 
results obtained?

Thanx.

So you mean, as the blind settings are the same for both models during
your current test runs, you actually have the same model set-up with
different geometry?

Is the "whitealum" material specular or diffuse?

Are you sure that your ambient paramters are suiteable for that set-up?
As far as I understand it, you get illumination only for the light
"directly" hitting your surfaces from the sky you generated. So you have
a very non-uniform environment for your rtrace-call. Did you ever render
an image of the scene, with the same parameters, using a fisheye-view
for the same view as your rtrace measurement point is getting? Imagine
the rtrace-measurement-point being a sensor, or put yourself into its
place, what do you expect to see - and do your rendering settings
account for that? As I have not seen the result, these are only guesses
for now, but I am pretty sure that you will need higher -ab settings for
such a set-up (probably -ab 4 or higher), and using ar and aa settings
to get a uniform luminance over your rooms surfaces. I guess your
ceiling is more or less black now (except the -av-contribution, but what
is your aw than)?

Good luck!

CU Lars.

You know that putting your blinds at 90 degrees closes them  
completely, right?

Yes,

I am aware that 90 degrees closes the blinds completely.
But still some Illuminance values are obtained after closing the 
blinds.

So, where is this light coming from?  Are your blinds translucent?   
Do you have light leaks?  Are there other sources of illumination?   
Or is it all coming from the ambient value (-av)?
