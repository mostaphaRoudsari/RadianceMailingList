Subject: [Radiance-general] Infrared scene simulation
Message-ID: <544511591@web.de>

Hi Greg,

after I put some more unsuccessfull effort in trying to find an alternative
to Radiance for my infrared-simulation problem I decided to try it with Radiance
and see what comes out. So I hope you don't mind if I bother you with some
stupid questions again.

I calculated the total amount of energy emitted by a 300?K blackbody as 
146.305W/(sr m^2). So the material for my source becones

     void light bright
     0
     0
     3  48.77 48.77 48.77

right? Now my Problem is how to create a material mixed from a glow and a 
reflective material. I must admit I am not able to figure out how to do this
from the available documentation. I tried the following

     void plastic brown
     0
     0
     5  .2  .1  .1  0  0

     brown glow brown_glow
     0
     0
     4 100 100 100 100

     brown_glow sphere BB
     0
     0
     4  2  1  1.5  .125

just as a test. oconv runs over it without complaints - but when I wan't to
watch the scene using rvu it says: 
	rvu: fatal - conflicting material "lbrown" for sphere "BB"

By the way what exactly does the maxrad parameter for the glow stand for (I
don't understand what is meant by shadow testing in this context)? Is it the
maximum distance from the glow which will be illuminated by it's radiation?

I also checked the documentation on mixtures but again do not know how I could
use these to solve my problem.

So it would be really great if you could help me out or tell me how others
solved this as you said!

Thanks and Best Regards

Alex

Dear colleagues,

 

My apologies for any cross posting.

 

This is a reminder/invitation that we will be hosting a three day
Executive Education Program on 'Daylighting Buildings' on June 29/30 and
July 10 at Harvard University, Graduate School of Design
(http://execed.gsd.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/exec_ed/details.cgi?offering_id=1
01683) . The workshop has been specifically designed for A&E and
consulting firms interested in adding advanced daylighting analysis
techniques to their portfolio. The first two days of the workshop will
consist of presentations and hands-on exercises. On the third day, which
will take place about a week later, we will reconvene either in person
or electronically, and participants will be asked to present an example
of how they applied the course content to a project of their choice. The
class and instructors will review the results and provide constructive
feedback. The main purpose of that third day is to 'force' participants
to apply what they have learnt shortly after the workshop so that they
do not forget the course content and start feeling more confident about
their simulation skills. 

 

As software we will be using:

-          CAD modeling: SketchUp, Ecotect and Rhino

-          Analysis: Ecotect, Radiance, Daysim, Evalglare

 

The following topics will be covered. Additional topics can be added at
participants' request:

-          The role of daylighting and simulations in design

-          Rules of thumb that work

-          Balance point and direct shading studies

-          Daylight factor calculation and analysis

-          Model Q&A

-          Climate-based daylighting metrics

-          Modeling occupant behavior

-          Predicting electric lighting energy use

-          Advanced glare analysis

-          Modeling light and health phenomena

-          Presenting results 

-          Modeling advanced materials

 

Please contact Margaret Moore de Chicojay (corlette_mccoy@harvard.edu;
617-496-8728) or myself should you have any questions regarding the
program. You are strongly encouraged to register by June 15.

Dear All,
 
I am fairly new to the use of Radiance, at the moment I am trying to run
a series of batch renderings in Radiance (for windows, using ecotect as
interface).
So far everything is fine, but if I want to use the -B and the -R option
in order to explicitly define the horizontal diffuse and direct
irradiance values from a weather file for each different sun position, I
do not know where or how I should enter the list of values. 
 
Any suggestion on how to do it (if it is possible) would be very
appreciated,
 
Cheers,
 
Giovanni

Hi Axel,

Thanks for explaining your exact problem.  The documentation for  
Radiance is scattered and frequently application-specific.  Did you  
browse the "Seminars and Course Notes" section of:

	http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/

Francesco Anselmo's Radiance wiki is also useful:

	http://www.bozzograo.net/radiancewiki/doku.php

Check out Axel Jacob's tutorials at:

	http://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/learnix/docs.shtml

As for describing a mixture, you need to use the "mixfunc" type.   
Correcting what you gave in your e-mail:

>      3  48.77 48.77 48.77

Don't bother dividing the value up, just give it three times:

      void light bright
      0
      0
      3  146.305 146.305 146.305

>      4  2  1  1.5  .125

Should be:

      void plastic brown
      0
      0
      5  .2  .1  .1  0  0

      void glow bit_of_glow
      0
      0
      4 100 100 100 100

	void mixfunc brown_glow
	4 brown bit_of_glow 0.5 .
	0
	0

      brown_glow sphere BB
      0
      0
      4  2  1  1.5  .125

--------
Note that I gave half of each, so their actual values will be reduced  
by 50%.  In some cases,  you may wish to double the parameters to  
compensate.

Hi Giovanni.

I'm not quite clear if you want to use the Radiance tools from the command line
or if you expect that there is a 'use these values' button in EcoTect.

In the fist case you have to find the file that contains the sky description in
the scene that's exported by EcoTect. -B and -R are options to the gensky
command that should be on one the lines in this file.

For a batch calculation of different values you have to loop over

1) modify the gensky command
2) recreate the scene octree
3) do the calculation again
4) move the images (or rtrace results) to a different place

This is possible with a bit of command line scripting.

Regards,
Thomas

Hi Thomas,

Thanks for your kind reply. Ecotect has a button that creates the batch process in a semi automated way, but you can not input the -B and -R parameters. I'll be happy to do it with command line scripting but I am not sure from where to start (the only thing I've managed to do so far in the command line was to use pcomb... not much I guess...).
Can you give me some help on that?

Thanks a lot for your time,

Giovanni

Sure.

A few things I need to know first:

Do you use Radiance on Windows or Linux?
Do you change anything else in the scene (like blinds) or just the sky?
Can you locate the exported scene and find the file with '!gensky ...'
in it? It might even have an extension like '*.sky'.

If Ecotect allows you export a batch rendering for different times of
day or similar you
could do that and see how it is realised in the export. We could use
those files and
just modify them to include changing '-B' and '-R' params.

I'll be a bit busy this afternoon. So it might take me a bit to reply.

Thomas, 
thanks for the quick reply.

I work on Windows.
At the moment I am just interested in changing the sky definition while the building geometry stays the same.
 The way it works for me now is that when I export out of ecotect I get a *.rif file containing scene information, views and rendering parameters plus two *.rad files, one containing the geometry and the materials definition, the other containing the sky and ground glow. I guess I could go into the command line with those information and run everything from there, although I've never tried it...

When I create a series of batch images, I need to provide ecotect with a *.brf (txt) file with the following information
Output name		Month 	Day	Time	Sky	Lat.	 Long.  TimeZone	Orientation

Which looks like this: 

row: ty3_001, 4, 1, 10.00, +s, 24.600, -46.700, -45.000, 42.000   55.9
row: ty3_002, 4, 1, 11.00, +s, 24.600, -46.700, -45.000, 42.000	55.9
row: ty3_003, 4, 1, 12.00, +s, 24.600, -46.700, -45.000, 42.000	55.9
row: ty3_004, 4, 1, 13.00, +s, 24.600, -46.700, -45.000, 42.000	55.9
row: ty3_005, 4, 1, 14.00, +s, 24.600, -46.700, -45.000, 42.000	55.9

What gets output is a batch file (*.bat) which automatically runs the command prompt and generates the different images and a *.rad file that overrides my previous sky definition and changes at every subsequent run.

I hope this answers your questions,

Thanks again,
Cheers,

Giovanni

I'd guess that last '55.9' is the -B value. It's optional but will
create a 10000lux sky which is a nice value to work with.

If you can access the *.bat file before it is run you should find the
sky definitions in it (assuming that is just lists each step in the
loop). You can simply add the -B and -R option and values to the line
that gets written into the sky file in each loop. Then run the batch
file as before.

If you have a few hundred or thousand values, though, we should find
another solution. If you can send me the *.bat file we can work out
the steps that are necessary in EcoTect.

Hee.  Thanks for the quick reply.  I'll drop a note to LBL's

can copy or even lend.

Good idea on Debian and all derivates is to read the README.Debian files of a
package if there is one.
/usr/share/doc/radiance/README.Debian :)

Hi All,

Can anybody help me with a simple problem?
How do you evaluate the average value of a radiance (*.pic or *.hdr)
image?
Many thanks,

Hi,

I suppose there is some command prompt command to do that easy and fast
(Greg?).

For more complex solution you can download and install
RadDisplay<http://deluminaelab.com/en/raddisplay_download.html>program.
RadDisplay works on Windows and Linux.
When you open pic image in the program, create False Color image and then
press "Stats" button. In the dialog you 'll have various image statistics
and average luminance too.


Hope this helps,
Marija

Hi Giovanni,

There are a number of ways to do it, but I prefer using pvalue.  For  
a color (RGB) average, you can use:

	pvalue -h -H -df test.hdr | total -if3 -m

For grayscale average:

	pvalue -b -h -H -df test.hdr | total -if1 -m

For original units (watts/sr/m^2) add a -o to either of the pvalue  
commands above.

Is the desired end result a daylight factor falsecolor? or just the data
such as min, max, avg, uniformity?
 
Depending on what your goal is, you may want to set up a grid of
calculation points (coordinates and direction vector), process your
scene, sky, and grid points through rtrace, and manipulate the the data
as required. See 6.4, Case Study II in RwR dealing with daylight factor
generation. If you need images you could use pvalue to create an image
from the grid of results and process it through falsecolor to put a
scale on it.

Try viewing the image with the ximage. I believe return allows you to
select an area of interest, check the manual page for ximage and mind
the units of your image.

IES appears to extract statistics from the PIC file by allowing the user
to trace an "Area of interest". Perhaps they're using their own program
for this.

Have you checked out the "dayfact" script that's in Radiance  
already?  If you have a model, it does most of the rest of what  
you're asking.

Please be prepared to defend your procedures if someone comes along
and has some doubts about the result. If you use a package that has the
official blessings (like IES) you can just push a button and point to the
certificate to make your results credible.

If you roll your own you have to know what's going on and how to validate
your results.

If I were to export a 3rd party CAD model (via, say su2rad) consisting of N
number of rooms, are there alternatives to the simple IES approach?

Since you asked:

In su2rad you would

1) check that your model is suitable for daylight simulations and
patch the geometry where necessary

2) define polygons where you want your working planes. If you want
more than one you also have to define groups to keep them apart.

3) Export - this will create files with calc points suitable for rtrace
input

4a) manually feed rtrace with these files and pipe it through rcalc to get
lux or df
4b) I might have already bundled a script to do it for you ...

5) use any form of spreadsheet, data visualizer or simple command
line tool to calculate your averages or plots.

In the future it may be possible to create an image from the polygons
via John M.s stencil method and visualise rtrace results in su2rad.
But we're not there yet.

WRT the other points mentioned: You can select an area in ximage
and print out the average as well as highlight max (and min?) values.
But I think you would be better off with defining a mask image and
use a composite. It's a precise and repeatable process as oposed
to manual input of pixel coords.

The tutorial materials should be on the RwR CD. I can have a look
when I'm back home next week.

Cheers,
Thomas

Subject: AW: [Radiance-general] Infrared scene simulation
Message-ID: <575186217@web.de>

Hi Greg,

first of all thank you for the last mail. Meanwhile I made some first tests and what I saw till now
seems to be quite promising for my needs. Unfortunately I still have some problems understanding
and handling the glow-reflection material mix. Maybe you can help me with this. So here is what I have done:

       # amount of radiation energy depends on the object's temperature and emissivity
                                # BB@T=21?C
        void glow glow_e1
        0
        0
        4 135.13 135.13 135.13 100

        This is my basic glow. 135.13W/m2/sr is about the radiation of a Blackbody at 21?C. I
        mixed this with some material the way you showed me:

        void mixfunc l_col040_
                4 glow_e1 col040_ e_plastic materials/emissivity.cal
                0
                0

         So the fraction of total radiation of the mixture from the Blackbody's one is applied here.

I rendered my scene and iradiance pictures and created the falsecolor picture and the distribution
of irradiance looks quite as I expected. Only surfaces which are not illuminated by other glows
appear absolutely "black", i.e. irradiance of 0. So it seems to me I only see reflection but not
the radiation emitted by the surfaces themselves.

I thought I might have to increase the max range of the glow so I gave a maxrad value of 10000
instead of 100. The result was that the total iradiance of the whole scene was limited to a tiny
fraction of the original one and this confused me completely.

So can you please tell me what I'm doing wrong?

Thanks in advance and Best Regards

Alex

Hi Axel,

Thanks for explaining your exact problem.  The documentation for  
Radiance is scattered and frequently application-specific.  Did you  
browse the "Seminars and Course Notes" section of:

	http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/

Francesco Anselmo's Radiance wiki is also useful:

	http://www.bozzograo.net/radiancewiki/doku.php

Check out Axel Jacob's tutorials at:

	http://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/learnix/docs.shtml

As for describing a mixture, you need to use the "mixfunc" type.   
Correcting what you gave in your e-mail:

Don't bother dividing the value up, just give it three times:

      void light bright
      0
      0
      3  146.305 146.305 146.305

Should be:

      void plastic brown
      0
      0
      5  .2  .1  .1  0  0

      void glow bit_of_glow
      0
      0
      4 100 100 100 100

	void mixfunc brown_glow
	4 brown bit_of_glow 0.5 .
	0
	0

      brown_glow sphere BB
      0
      0
      4  2  1  1.5  .125

--------
Note that I gave half of each, so their actual values will be reduced  
by 50%.  In some cases,  you may wish to double the parameters to  
compensate.

Cheers,

I was wondering why the file xyz_rgb.cal is not getting copied into the

Hi,

I want to add view information to radiance rgbe files that were 
assembled from low dynamic range images.

The only way I can think to do so at the moment is to use pvalue as long 
as I do not want to directly write the binary files. Is there some 
other, easier way available to modify the "metadata"?

Thank you, cheers,

Hi Lars.

A few months back Greg posted a command line to convert
one picture's perspective into another. I don't remember
which tool from the standard set he used but this might
help you to find it. That tool might help you.

I have to do the same thing for my scripts but I think
I just add the missing "view=" line to the image header.
No binary munging involved. If you can wait till tomorrow
I can post what I do to solve the problem from my scripts.
Just can't find it at the moment.

The script is called "vinfo" and gets installed automatically with

Hi Greg,

thank you for again surprising us with a new tool. Unfortunately this 
one is again in the good old tradition of conflicting with vi (well, I 
am really curious how many commands I type lead me to that little editor)...

The reason I was asking is that I am working on full-frame fisheye hdr 
images as they are expected e.g. by findglare and evalglare. These 
images do not have any view information included, and I am trying to add 
this missing part of information.

Cheers Lars.

Hi Lars,

There isn't really a "vinfo" command, is there?  What does it do?  I  
used the name because the editor it applies is in fact "vi," so it  
seemed appropriate.  Feel free to modify the code to edit the header  
as you like.  The getinfo command can be used with "ed" to accomplish  
this.

That's not quite correct. 'vinfo' is a true and proper Greg-style csh script
that strips the binary part from the image and shows you only the header
in the editor - which is vi. If you call the tool without image all you get
is an editor window without content. In 'vim' this shows a greeting message
which you probably saw.

In fact if you have 'vim' I think you can edit the image headers directly,
without splitting the binary bits. I think I did that before.

Unfortunately I haven't actually done a script yet (just manual testing) but
what I will need to do is adding view lines to Sketchup images. I found that
in Ruby or Python you can just use something like

view = "VIEW= -vta -vp 3.5 4.5 1.5 ..."
img = file("mypic.hdr").read()
img.sub("\n\n", "%s\n\n" % view)
newfile = file("newpic.hdr", 'w').write(img)
newfile.close()

Basically you just replace the two newline characters at the end of
the header with a "VIEW=" line followed by 2 newlines. (I hope this
is proper Python code - haven't used it in a while).

Lars,

I wrote a little Perl script some time ago, to help out a student
who wanted to batch-correct the exposure info in HDRs. The script is 
available here:

http://www.luxal.eu/resources/hdr/hdrexpo/index.shtml

It's called hdrexpo. Feel free to use it as a base for for your own HDR 
header manipulation, if you're happy to stick to the GPL license. I'd be 
happy to put in your changes.

Axel
