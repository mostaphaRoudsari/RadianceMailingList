Subject: [Radiance-general] mkillum implementation for light modifier (l+
	switch)
Message-ID: <49ABC15E.9000803@nus.edu.sg>

Hi,

I have a question regarding the l+ switch for mkillum. As the light 
modified surfaces as generated by mkillum with l+ block direct light 
sources, the direct components should be included into their 
distribution. At least if this is what they are made for. So is this 
switch only for debugging purposes and does not change the actual 
calculation done by mkillum, or does it also generate a valid 
representation of the environment?

Thanks & CU, Lars.

Hi Lars,

The 'l+' option to mkillum (that's that's a lower-case 'L,' everyone)  
turns designated surfaces into light sources, which as you say must  
include all components for correctness.  This will NOT produce an  
appropriate model for blinds that admit direct sunlight, but will be  
fine if sunlight is excluded by the blind angle or for diffusing or  
other surfaces where the direct component is negligible.

It's not merely for debugging purposes -- using light sources rather  
than illum's is appropriate under some circumstances.

-Greg

Hello

I am trying to determine Daylight coefficient in a classroom using ESP-r and
RADIANCE. I am getting a message on selecting sky type that "not  a radiance
skyfile". What could be the reason for this? I have installed Gendaylit and
included the link to the Gendaylit in PATH and to the Sky .cal files in
RAYPATH. Is it some problem with gensky? What should I do about this?

Thank you

Regards
Chandrayee

Message-ID: <BAY125-W34BD5018E34CD1029A0031B0A60@phx.gbl>


Hi all!

I've finally got my ubuntu partition in working order with Radiance installed and ready to go. Unfortunately, my office only had a dual core machine available for my use, so I need to get Radiance running some parallel processes on the two cores. I've been reading up on the -N option for rad, but whenever I use "-N 2" as a parameter, only one of the cores is running rad. Does the -N option actually work, or do I need to use rpiece for running radiance on both processors. 

Thanks,
Matthew Brugman

Hi Matthew,

I believe that the -N option of rad will start multiple instances of 
rpict, with each instance working on a different view (ie NOT parallel 
processing on the same view). So if the rad file that you have only has 
one view then using -N 2 will not accomplish anything.

If your intent is to distribute one image (view) over multiple cores 
then you will need to look into rpiece.

Regards,

-Jack de Valpine

Well it works, but not the way you were hoping for I guess ;-) The -N 2
will distribute your views (or frames) over two rpict processes - but it
will not divide one view into parts (or pieces, hm, that is why it is
called rpiece). So to make use of more then one CPU or core or network
node or whatever, you will need more then one view defined. By the way,
I have also used ranimate for this task, which has some  extra
functionality for cluster support...

For most cases, with modern machines, it is not worth the trouble to
care about distributing the rendering calculations for one view. In some
special cases, where you have very complicated scenes or want to render
in very high resolution, rpiece may be a good solution.

CU Lars.

	Workshop @ Harvard
Message-ID: <C5E1527F129BF545A250B5AD0B0C26EF0307E229@ENTWEXMB0000000.university.harvard.edu>

Dear friends and colleagues,

 

It is my pleasure to announce that we will be hosting this year's
International Radiance Workshop on October 22/23 at the Harvard Graduate
School of Design. The school is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts,
which is part of the Boston Metropolitan Area. Logan Airport is the
closest international airport. The International Radiance Workshops are
annual gatherings of developers and users of the Radiance backward
raytracer. The workshop consists of a series of presentations that in
the past included case studies on the use of Radiance in lighting and/or
daylighting projects, recent advanced in glare detection, visual comfort
and energy savings from lighting controls as well as the use of Radiance
in Art and Design. At least one session is typically also dedicated to
technical advances that have been made within the Radiance engine over
the past year. Presentations from previous workshops can be downloaded
from http://www.radiance-online.org/. 

We are planning to split the workshop into an 'application day'
(Thursday) and a more 'technical day' (Friday). Workshop fees have not
been determined, yet, but should be within the $250 to $300 range. We
will offer a reduced student registration fee. I will soon send out
another email with registration details and a call for presentations.
For now, mark your calendars! 

 

I look forward to welcoming you in Cambridge,

Great work, thank you!!!

One note to be added to the list for the next update: under applications 
using the format, imagemagick should be added, as it is used by a lot of 
application for image handling. I use it quite frequently for quick 
conversion to jpg (using convert -gamma 2.2 in.hdr out.jpg) when I want 
e.g. to send a preview by mail. Not urgent really, but if you should 
ever want to update the record, you could include this.

Thanks, Greg.  You're very welcome.

I don't think the IANA is set up for frequent updates, but I'll file  
the additional platforms, and in a while submit them.  I'd no idea the  
type was so widely implemented.  I didn't know Zumtobel Vivaldi even  
existed!

Subject: [Radiance-general] Rendering of normal map
Message-ID: <49B4DD37.5020502@imi.aau.dk>



Dear Radiance community,

I wish to use Radiance to render a normal map of a scene. By normal map
I mean a floating point RGB image, where the RGB values of each pixel
correspond to the xyz coordinates of the surface normal in scene
coordinates. More precisely, for example for the red channel:

     R = (Nx + 1)/2

where Nx is the surface normal (in scene coordinates, not camera
coordinates) of the primary ray intersection point for a given ray. With
the expression given above the resulting pixel values should be in the
range from 0 to 1.

I have been working with making my own normal.cal function, since Nx,
Ny, and Nz are available in rayinit.cal, so it should be dead easy, I
just can't figure out how to return the offset/scaled N values as RGB
values directly, so as to completely bypass any lighting computations.

Best,
Claus

I think I'd use rtace with -oN, pipe the result to rtrace to calculate 
your channel value, and convert the output into a radiance hdr format 
using pvalue.

I guess that, if you want to do all this with rpict and render the 
surfaces "in your scene", you could try the glow modifier as a material 
to modify. Just as a starting point.

Hi Lars,

your little hint concerning glow was the final push I needed to crack 
the nut. It turned out to be even easier than I expected. Here is my 
material specification (glow, modified by colorfunc, which calls a 
normalshader.cal function file that I wrote, listed further down):

----------------------------------------------------------------

# Materials

void glow normalglow
0
0
4 1.0 1.0 1.0 -1

normalglow colorfunc normalshadermaterial
4 red green blue normalshader.cal
0
0

------------------------------------------

The normalshader.cal looks like this (thanks to Greg for making function 
files so easy to use and versatile):

{
  normalshader.cal

  Look in RADIANCE/lib/rayinit.cal for more info on builtin funcs and vars
}

red = (Nx + 1)/2;
green = (Ny + 1)/2;
blue = (Nz + 1)/2;

-------------------------------------------------------------------------


A example normal map is attached. It looks a little ugly because it is a 
triangle mesh constructed from a stereo camera scan of an outdoor scene 
(color image attached, too).

Best,

Claus

	Rotterdam, 13-14 May 2009
Message-ID: <OF0D152DDA.669285ED-ONC1257578.00500045-C1257578.00506E7E@velux.com>

3rd VELUX Daylight Symposium in Rotterdam, 13-14 May 2009

The third VELUX Daylight Symposium on daylight quality in buildings will 
be held at Van Nelle Factory in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, on 13 and 14 
May 2009.

The previous daylight symposiums, held in Budapest in 2005 and in Bilbao 
in 2007, brought together participants from research, education and 
architectural practices as well as legislators and lighting designers from 
all over the world.

Worldwide interest in daylighting has been renewed considerably to meet 
future challenges in relation to energy efficiency, and a growing movement 
towards sustainable buildings has established a hopeful target for 
buildings to reach energy self-sufficiency in the near future. At the same 
time, medical and health research is focusing more on light and its effect 
on human health and a unified understanding of light and its impact on 
human beings has evolved; in general, buildings that use daylight are 
healthier places to live in.

This third daylight symposium will focus specifically on benefits in 
connection with energy use and health. The programme will provide updates 
on the scientific progress in the field as well as experiences and 
viewpoints from architectural practices. The programme will also include 
separate sessions addressing particular aspects of daylighting as well as 
open discussions between the speakers and the audience. The symposium will 
feature invited papers and commentaries from leading scientists and 
practitioners. 

For more information on the programme and registrations please visit 
www.thedaylightsite.com.

http://www.thedaylightsite.com/symposium.asp?tp=1024&y=2009

Deadline for registration on 4 April 2009.

Subject: [Radiance-general] How to calculate the ( rtn gtn btn ) values of

Message-ID: <51fa7f670903110412w28011b3bk5c4792b8b7a96228@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

i don?t know haw can you get the values rtn, gtn and btn of the material
description "glass":

void   glass  id
0
0
3   rtn  gtn  btn

from some glass samples.

I have measured their transmittance values with a Spectrometer ( Varian -
Cary 5000) in the field 350 - 780 nm wavelenght and have calculate the
Transmittace.
Should I then calculate the transmissivity from the transmittance by
computing

tn = (sqrt(.8402528435+.0072522239*Tn*Tn)-.9166530661)/.0036261119/Tn  ?


and, in this case, how can I get the values rtn, gtn and btn?

Thanks a lot,

Marina

Dear all,

I was looking the rtcontutor example of the Radiance 2006 Workshop and the examples of the R3.8. I have a question for the 
second pass of rtcontrib. If I understand correctly, the input for rtcontrib is the tregsamp.dat
 file but modified by rcalc. The modofication applies to the rays origin which from 0,0,0 I think 
that they are distributed 1.7m off the facade of the building. It looks that the directions 
remain the same. In adittion, if one tries to actually plot the file it looks that all these rays are directed to the facade of the building.


The description for this step within the readme file was "The second stage computes the incidence of sky 
illumination on these portholes, and the results are combined".

Could somebody throw a little bit of light on this step as I can not figure out the logic behind. Hopefully, 
I have not misunderstood what's going on and this email does make a bit of sense. 

Cheers,

George

Hi users,

I just started using vwrays and encountered an error.

Here is my input:

scene_CIE_win1.oct > illum.pic

and I get the following error: rtrace fatal: Unexpected EOF on input.

Can any spot my mistake? Any help is appreciated :)

I would first check your model for coplanar surfaces. Maybe your box shaped room does not have a hole cut out where the glass is inserted?

I am trying to use radiance for visualising the illuminance at the workplane of a simple classroom model developed in ecotect. I am calling radiance from ecotect. Further I will use DAYSIM for detailed calculation of UDI and DC. I have downloaded RADIANCE for windows from http://www.arch.mcgill.ca/prof/reinhart/software/Radiance3P7forWindows.zip. I have used the materials library from http://irc.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ie/lighting/daylight/daysim/docs/NRC_LightingLibrarySetup.exe. However the image I am getting after rendering is pretty weird. It seems that the glass has not been properly rendered. I have set all the rendering options to medium. Even with high quality specification and ecotect libraries (glass material other than the link previously mentioned), I am getting the same result. Further when I am importing the .rad file to daysim the glass seems to be having some problem. Please find the image of the room after render attached and let me know how I can solve this problem.
 
Thank you
Regards
Chandrayee

You substituted "view_outside.vf" fro "view_down.vf" in the second  
use of vwrays, so it probably produced the wrong -x and -y dimensions.

Incidentally, "view_down.vf" better be a parallel view, or all your  
origin points passed to rtrace will be the same.

Hi George,

What part is unclear to you?  The second stage is a kind of forward  
ray-tracing to determine the relationship between sky patches and  
outgoing directions in each of the ceiling "sources."

Message-ID: <3acd9e4a0903142252q11a2543bt608decddfb28f4f8@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Radiance users,

I'm writing here for third time and I always sorry for just asking.
I'm modeling a small box has a several bared cylindrical fluorescent lamps
(actually UV lamps) inside and want to know the irradiance level on the
surfaces of the box. The cylindrical lamps has 32mm in diameter and 540mm in
length and The radiance of 44W/sr/m2 calculated with the UV output of the
lamps (7.5W) was applied to the lamps. Before calculating the small box
model I checked irradiance values with an experiment measuring UV intensity
at the distance of 1 m and compared that with the same simple RADIANCE
calculation and the result was reasonable. However, the calculation
results are higher than those of experiments by 2~4 times with the small box
model. The small box is not simple but not so complicated. I have modeled
the lamp both as a cylinder and 72 polygons  but there were not so much
changes. Only one channel was used to calculate irradiances of UV from
modeling to issuing results and only diffused reflections were assumed.
Geometric errors or abnormal radiance distributions of lamps could be
assumed to cause the discrepancy, but 2~5 times are too large
Here is my rtrace options.

cat pts_sensor.pts | rtrace -I -oov -ar 128 -ad 512 -as 256 -ab 2 -ds 0.02
uv.oct > uv.dat

It would be appreciated if anyone give me advice.

Hi,

are you sure the material properties of the box match those you use in
your experiment? How did you define the materials?

How did you measure the UV reflectance of the surfaces of your box?   
Most paints drop off dramatically from the visible spectrum to UV.   
White paints may re-emit UV as visible so they appear "whiter" under  
daylight illumination.  You really need to know the behavior of your  
paint with respect to ultraviolet wavelengths to do this correctly.

Are you sure that your view-file has the correct format? Maybe you first 
try it giving the views on the command-line as such:

Dear Lars and Greg,

Thank you for your replying. As you said, the reflectance for UV is usually
lower than that for visible light. Actually, the box is an air handling unit
and the materials are mostly galvanized copper plates and the reflectance of
it for UV is referred from other reference. I thought the result might be
caused by incorrect reflectance so I have checked the values when only
direct components were calculated by deleting -ab option. The values dropped
eventually but were higher than those of experiment yet. I'm checking if
there are problems with the lamp model.

Sung

Hm, how did you calculate the 44W/sr/m2 for the lamps? I get
7.5/(2*pi*0.54*0.032)=7.5/0.1086=69W/m2, divided by pi=21.99 W/m2sr.
This means that your light source is two times brighter than I would
expect it to be.

Well, it is probably not. But if you multiply the 7.5W to get the lumen
output, lampcolor will internally divide by 179 to calculate back to
radiometric values, so the result should be fine (as long as you do not
start to multiply the results of rtrace to get anything like lux or nits
from what is not visible light ;-) )...

One nice problem if comparing the result to experimental measurements
will be that the lamp's age will probably show some influence on the
real output. So most probably something like 7.5W*0.9 or 0.8 would be
more realistic. But I have NO experience with this UV stuff, so this is
something to find out first.

Thank you for your comments. As only radiance(W/m2sr) or irradiance(W/m2)
values are being dealt with from modeling to results lamp color does not
make problem as Lars said and radiance value also has no problem as 0.032m
is diameter, which Lars might already know. But the aging of lamps might
need to be checked, that means all the conditions of experiment should be
checked again as the experiment was done at the field, in case there is no
problem in RADIANCE calculation.

Hi!

Well, good point.... ;-)

Maybe this is of help:

http://www.uvequip.co.za/faq.htm

"Of the approximately 456 types of fluorescent lamps made all of the UV 
or Blacklight lamps make up less than 1% of the total lighting 
industries lamp production. Therefore there is not much economic 
incentive to do research to develop low UV depreciation LW phosphors and 
lamps. The typical UV depreciation of a 4W, 6W, or 8W LW lamp might be 
as much as 40% to 50% in about 2,400 hours.

UV SYSTEMS has just completed a scientific UV depreciation test using 
one TripleBright II LW LL-60-352 lamp. From this test it was determined 
that the UV output of that lamp depreciated to about 80% of initial 
output (a 20% reduction) after about 7,000 hours of use. While this was 
only a sample of one, it could be typical of all LL-60-352 lamps."

And some more tests (you can see a set-up how to determine the 
depreciation in this paper, too):

Hi Greg,

I don't know how I didn't thought about this. It seems also like quite
an intuituve description!
The results also look like right.

Nevertheless I define how I have proceeded, because there is a step that
could be wrong.

>From the hole transmitance spectrum of each glass sample I have just
taken the transmittance values at this wavelengths you said and then
calculated its tn

#glass sample 01

Rot=700nm        Tn=40.8            rtn= 18.093
Green=546         Tn=48.13          gtn= 18.813
Blue=436            Tn=42.87          btn= 18.317

void glass smpl_01
0
0
3    0.18093    0.18813        0.18317

And this would be the hole material description of this transparent
glass, als just one layer glass, 10mm thick

Thanks again,

Hi Marina,

The tn formula assumes your Tn values are between 0 and 1, not 0 and  
100% -- your results should be:

void glass smpl_01
0
0
3 0.4449 0.5248 0.4675

Good that you checked!

Hello Everyone,

I am simulating to find illuminance values for different angles of 
Venetian blinds, Using Mkillum.. Do we need to consider Blinds as 
part of the Luminous plane generated by mkillum..? We are getting 
better results when using just a plane polygon as Luminous 
secondary source as compared to when we include Blinds in the 
fenestration system as luminous plane. ( comparing two different 
systems of blinds of similar angles and characteristics.)


Thank you

If I understand you right - are you asking wether to replace the each
blind's surface by a mkillum-generated illum??? This makes no sense -
you have aluminium blinds, and no light will pass through a blind. This
must lead to really funny results.

Mkillum has been written to precalculate the effect of compex
fenestration such as blinds. You calculate a light source on the inside
of the complex fenestration using mkillum, so that during your (rpict or
rtrace) rendering, the light source for ambient calculations is not
obstructed. The reasons for this are explained in detail in the book
"Rendering with Radiance".

In your case there are only two reasonable options as far as I
understood so far. Either render without mkillum, but very(!!!)  high
quality settings for ad, as, aa, ab (which will take a long time), or
seal your complete fenestration system with mkillum-generated illum
surface(s) as explained in the book.

Lars is correct; as Greg Ward says, you want the virtual light source 
positioned just inside of "where it gets nasty".  You're basically 
taking the backwards ray tracing operation away from the view plane and 
placing it right up against the blinds to help guarantee that plenty of 
rays get through the "nastiness" and find those bright light sources out 
there.  The result of that calculation is then saved as a .dat file and 
used on that virtual light source plane in the regular calculation, 
giving much better results in less time (opposed to relying on brute 
force with the ambient calculation).  As Lars said, there is good 
information on this in the RwR text.

Message-ID: <91F362C23F834E4DAB6D76CAD0564171@UNIVERSI047A23>

Hi,

 

I am rendering a number of images on a machine with multiple processors. 

I'm using rpiece with the -PP option (splitting into 4 pieces with the hope
of running one on each or the 4 processors in my machine), but still only
ever seem to be using 1 processor at a time.

I get multiple rpict threads, but only one of them seems to do anything at
any one time.

 

Does anyone know where I'm going wrong, or even if it's possible to use
multiple cpus in the same machine at once?

 

Many thanks,

Glen Harding.

It is possible, and asked here from time to time. The trick is to start
one with all the command line arguments and the others without, so that
they will take over from the parent process. BUT: If you have several
frames to render, I would not care. It is much easier to render the
frames in parallel then slicing the single images. And to render all the
views at one (if you have enough processors) you just call rad -N 8 (for
eight CPUs), and it will start eight images at once for you. Much
easier, same effect.

Besides that, if you have really lots of frames, I have an old
documentation on how to use ranimate for similar stuff:

Hi Glen,

The -PP is used for memory sharing on a single host running multiple 
processes. If you have a machine with 4 cores then you will need to 
start 4 copies of rpiece. So with something like the following:

    rpiece -x 800 -y 800 -X 2 -Y 2 -F my_syncfile.sync <rpict options
    including -PP my_persistfile.pp> -o myimage.unf myscene.oct

    this command line would need to be run 4 times in order to get the 4
    processes up and running

This would result in an image split into a 2 by 2 grid and spread out 
over 4 processes. The memory including the scene would be shared among 
the 4 processes, thus reducing the memory footprint.

This can be automated simply using a Makefile or with other tools such 
as Perl or Python.

Let me know if you have any further questions and I can try to answer.

Hello Everyone,

I am trying to find illuminance values on an yearly basis, I am 
expecting to get different values for different seasons. Say if we 
compare between march nad december, we should get higher values of 
illuminance for december as compared to march. But I am getting 
almost same values for both the months.

I am not sure if the software is considering sun angles in 
calculations.

I am running this script to find the values,



#!/bin/csh -f

You are rendering an intermediate sky /without/ sun. Check the manpage
of gensky about how to switch on the sun. Do a test using rvu, looking
up with a fish-eye view - if you do not see the sun, there will be
little contribution for direct sunlight. You can always test the output
of gensky - if there is no light modifier defined called solar, there
will be no sun (which is defined as solar source sun, by the way).

> mkillum -ab 0 -ad 1024 -av 0.1 0.1 0.1 hr.oct "<"
> windowillum.rad>illumination.rad

I think you do not want -ab 0 for mkillum. You do not calculate anything
here - setting the ambient parameters high, but calculating 0 bounces
(this means nothing) is not very reasonable. If you still have your
blinds there, run mkillum with 2, than 3 and 4, and find out if you have
significant changes.

> oconv -i hr.oct outside.rad Conv-0.rad illumination.rad>hour.oct

You should be able to reduce -ad here, a much lower value should be fine
and give a great gain in rendering speed.

At a first glance the script seems fine.

But your problem is most likely that gensky does not know about the
absolute irridiance values of a particular sky. It only creates a distribution
pattern with an unspecified total value. If you want to create a sky with
ie. 50000lux you can specify this with one of the -b/-B or -r/-R options.

You can find typical values for the sky illuminance at your location in
climate data files which are available for various energy simulation packages.

Thomas

It seems strange that you define
mon=12   (= december)
and
Month=March

While it may be much better to use empirical weather data, gensky will 
calculate the brightness of the sky dome and the sun from the sun 
position. So while overriding these calculated values using b, B, r or R 
may be the way to improve results for a given location, the value given 
by gensky is not really unspecified. At least I would hope so... ;-)

Subject: [Radiance-general] modeling external glass lamella
Message-ID: <fdd7db810903250745u341a3753w19490a5c4b804f46@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Radiance list,

I have build up a model of a room with external glass blinds. The aim with
my simulations is to obtain the light transmittance of the glass blinds, and
for the entire system (blinds + window).

The blinds are modeled as polygons with the trans material. This means that
the blinds have no thickness in the model, but the reflectance and
transmittance values correspond to the information from the glass
manufacturer (r=0.31 and LT=0.65).

My approach is to obtain illuminance at three different locations:

1) Before the blinds, externally;

2) Between the blinds and the window, externally;

3) After the window, internally.



I have therefore made a grid of points in these locations. The orientation
of my measuring points is outwards, perpendicular to the fa?ade.

My results show that the illuminance level is increased at loaction 2
compared to location 1, which is a result I do not find reliable! I have
placed calculation points in the entire height of the window with a spacing
of 0.01, to be sure not to have the result affected by high illuminance
levels locally. I would have expected higher illuminance levels locally due
to the redirecting of light in the glass blinds, but I would not have
expected a higher average illuminance level.  My simulation approach is
given below  ? please let me know if you can find any mistakes.

Thanks in advance

/Anne

Hi Anne,

You need to share your trans specification, as this may be a  
problem.  It's too easy to get it wrong, and specify a surface that  
produces more light than it receives....

Anne,

There is also an excellent flowchart for understanding how trans 
interactions are calculated; it definitely helps in defining valid trans 
descriptions:

Hi Rob and Greg,
Thanks for your answers!
I have carried out simulations with two different definitions of trans, but
I get the same result for each type of trans. For both approaches, when
checking the material under a glow sky, I get the reflectance 0.31 when
looking down on the glass and I get the transmittance 0.65 when looking in
the direction upwards.

I have listed my discription of trans below - looking forward to hearing
your comments.

Br
Anne


The trans data is defined as:
# a1, a2 og a3 = 1, due to the color of the glass is included in the
transmittance end reflectance given by the manufacturer
# a4 = 0,31
# a5 = 0
# a6 = trans, determined from t_s=a6*a7(1-a4), where t_s is 0.65 and a7=1
# a7 = 1

void trans lamel_trans
0
0
7  1 1 1 0.31 0 0.942028986 1

I have also tried to define my trans material according to the description
in http://www.schorsch.com/rayfront/manual/transdef.html.
#Spec=Light reflectance = 0.31
#The color of the glass is determined from:
#Absorptance=(1-spec)(1-color) -> 0.04 = (1-0.31)(1-color), from where the
color is found to be 0.94
#Transmittance = (1-spec) *color* trans, transmittance is 0.65 and trans can
then be found to be 1
#Rough is set to 0, as the material is glass
#Tr-spec is set to 1, as the glass is a clear glass material



void trans lamel_transrayfront
0
0
7  0.94 0.94 0.94 0.31 0 1 1

Hi Anne,

The first trans definition should be correct.  The best thing to do  
at this point is to e-mail me your model so I can run the simulations  
and debug them on my end.  Don't send it to the list.

Thanks!

Subject: [Radiance-general] "Rendering with Radiance" still not available
Message-ID: <49D2DBCA.3040605@nus.edu.sg>

Hi!

I got the message from Amazon today that they gave up trying to provide 
me with the book that we tried to order several times over the last half 
year. Obviously it is not printed, even if multiple orders go in, as I 
read about others who also ordered during these last months.

Is there any possibility that the book will be printed again in the 
future? If not, has it been considered to provide it as a digital copy, 
like in ps or pdf format? I guess that even the smallest amount to be 
charged for download would result in better monetary benefit for the 
authors then a printed edition, which is listed at a higher price, but 
not sold because noone is printing it. Right now, the information 
collected in the book is simply lost for anyone starting to work with 
Radiance, only libraries that purchased a copy years ago have still some 
of the books available.

I feel that it is a pity to have this book, that is refered to in every 
second mail on the list, and probably the only source of information 
covering really more or less any aspect of Radiance, is currently 
disappearing from the library shelves and cannot be replaced, and of 
course will prevent radiance from playing a role in new programmes that 
cannot use it if no documentation is available.

CU Lars.

yes Lars,

I have ordered and they are still trying to find..

I am in for PDF format with small download price
