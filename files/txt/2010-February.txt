Dear all,

the rtcontrib lesson has found a new home here:
http://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/learnix/docs/rtcontrib_lesson.html

There are likely to be many typos, mistakes and inconsistencies left in 
it, but it's mostly done: Dynamic daylight simulations with Radiance's 
rtcontrib can be done. Well, sort of-ish.

As to the software--All scripts that are provided with the tutorial are 
available as a download. The link is on the page. Everything was written 
to get a particular task done. There is absolutely no flexibility built 
into any of the code. If you do decide to try some of the things that I 
have covered and come up with some better/more elegant/more configurable 
software or command lines, I'd be happy to hear from you. Please 
consider sharing your experience.

Thank you all for the feedback, especially Greg! You've been extremely 
helpful.

Cheers

Axel

If i delete the rif file and change the command " rad 5.rif" into "oconv
5.rad 5_sky.rad > 5.oct". And run again, the results looks the same.

Hi Victor,

sorry it is hard to help out. Can you please try to give clear 
information that allows us to reproduce what happened? If I take your 
words above literally, the "results" should be just one file in the 
current directory called "5.oct". This will always look the same as long 
as you do not change the file name and scene description. So, if you 
experience different results for different command sequences, exactly 
list the commands in the order you executed them and specify what you 
got as result. Usually, result will be a error message, one or more 
values or in some cases image files, that you could upload somewhere and 
refer to by giving a link in your email. So far we have no reproduceable 
problem description and cannot see what you really did or got back.

Cheers, Lars.

I am sorry about my explianation!
If i delete the rif file and change the command " rad 5.rif" into "oconv
5.rad 5_sky.rad > 5.oct". And run again, the result looks right and
reasonable.

If i donot delete rif file. And simulate with differrent "INDIRECT" number
in rif file and keep other settings the same. The results of illumiance in
the grid are differreent with the changing of "INDIRECT"
I thought the results of illumiance would not change with the different
"INDIRECT" However, it is not. I am confulsed by this. Do you know why?

Hi Victor, again, please take some time to clearly describe what you do!
> I am sorry about my explianation!

> "oconv 5.rad 5_sky.rad > 5.oct". And run again, the result looks right

So
1) you delete the rif-file
2) you type oconv 5.rad 5_sky.rad > 5.oct
3) you get a reasonable result

I do not believe this as most probably you did not get any result. If I 
reproduce your steps until here, all I get is an oct-file called 5.oct. 
You did not even run any simulation according to your description. I do 
not know what the meaning is of "and run again".

Do not take this as unfriendly, but if you expect people on this list to 
spend time thinking about your problem and helping out, the least you 
could do is to take your time to describe the problem and the steps that 
led you there. By the way, after having the typo in the subject line for 
how many posts, I corrected it. Please be a bit careful with what you 
post here. There are lots of quite busy professionals on this list, who 
will always do their best to help out if they get asked in a proper way.

Cheers

Lars.

I don't normally post conference announcements to the list, but this  
is an excellent symposium I have attended many times in years past  
(even co-chairing it one year), and the organizer, Karol Myszkowski,  
is a good friend of mine.

-Greg

--------------------
Call for Papers
---------------

The Eurographics Symposium on Rendering 2010 will take place in
Saarbr?cken, Germany, from June 28 to June 30, 2010.  This is the 21st
annual event in the series of very successful Eurographics Symposia on
Rendering and Eurographics Workshops on Rendering.

The local organizers are Karol Myszkowski and Elmar Eisemann and the
program chairs are Jason Lawrence and Marc Stamminger.  Up-to-date
information about the conference is available on the official EGSR
2010 web site:

      http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/egsr2010/


Conference Topics
-----------------

Conference topics include (but are not limited to):

- Global illumination
- Reflectance, volumetric scattering and translucency
- Representations of material appearance
- Human perception and error measures
- Rendering hardware and its application
- Computational photography
- Rendering dynamic/animated environments
- Shadows and visibility
- Monte Carlo techniques
- Finite element techniques
- Sampling, filtering, and anti-aliasing
- Texture models, analysis, and synthesis
- Non-photorealistic rendering
- Image-based measurement and rendering
- Sensing for graphics
- Point-based rendering
- Real-time rendering and real-time ray tracing
- Systems and software architecture for rendering
- Virtual/augmented reality and interactive systems
- Audio/sound rendering


The proceedings of EGSR will be a special issue of the journal Computer
Graphics Forum. Because of this there will be a brief second review
cycle for any papers that require changes to be accepted; such papers
will only be accepted after the changes have been confirmed by the
program committee.


Important Dates
---------------

All deadlines are 11:59 p.m., US Eastern Daylight Time (UTC-4).

Abstract submission deadline: Friday, April 9
Paper submission deadline: Tuesday, April 13
Author notification: Friday, May 14
Revisions due: Wednesday, May 26
Final PDF files due for printing: Friday, May 28
Symposium: June 28 - 30

The EGSR review and publication process is very short, and to achieve
this quick turnaround all deadlines must be strictly observed. In
particular, final PDF files for printing must be finished on time.

Instructions for Submission
---------------------------

All contributions submitted to the Eurographics Symposium on Rendering
2010 must be original, unpublished work. Any work that has previously
been published or simultaneously been submitted in substantially
similar form to any other conference or journal will be
rejected. Contributions must be written and presented in English.

Only electronic submissions will be accepted. Submitted manuscripts
should be formatted using the Eurographics publication style
proceedings templates, and be anonymized for the double-blind
reviewing process.

Papers should be as long as their content requires, but not
longer. Papers with average length requirements are expected to be 8
formatted pages long, including references and all figures; up to 10
pages will be allowed only where justified. During the review process,
each paper's contribution will be judged in proportion to its length:
a solid contribution described clearly and succinctly is more likely
to be accepted than the same result submitted in a longer paper.

All submissions must be made through the Eurographics Submission and
Review Management system, using the following URL.

  http://egmcp1.cgv.tugraz.at/SRM_SR2010

The submission deadlines will be strictly enforced.  The authors of

Hi Victor,

As is often the case with Radiance the problem likely lies outside what you
think is causing it.  That is why we need more info to properly diagnose.

I'd suggest posting all your scene files (sky, geometry and materials), rif
file and complete list of commands you are using to achieve inconsistent
results.  Proper etiquette is not to attach files to a list posting, but
instead upload them to a website and include a link in your list posting.

While I wait for more info, I'll speculate that maybe rad is creating an
octree file with extra or fewer scene files because the rif file is missing
something.

Best,
Andy

Hello all,

I've been working through Axel Jacobs' excellent 'rtcontrib' tutorial  
(thank you Axel!!) and have hit a wall when it comes to using the  
'reinhart.cal' file in lieu of the 'tregenza.cal file.  Using the  
latter 'cal' file I get a complete bin of images for each patch:
$ vwrays -ff -vf fish_up.vf | rtcontrib @rtc.opt -ffc $(vwrays -d -vf  
fish_up.vf)   -f tregenza.cal -b tbin -o ./images/patches/p%03d.hdr -m  
sky_glow -w test.oct

However when using the reinhart.cal file the images in the bin are  
only partially completed  and listed as 'unfinished' when viewed with  
ximage (I'm pretty sure that I'm using the most recent reinhart.cal  
file; v 1.4 2009/12/09 21:34:23):
$ vwrays -ff -vf fish_up.vf | rtcontrib @rtc.opt -ffc $(vwrays -d -vf  
fish_up.vf) -e MF:2  -f reinhart.cal -b rbin -o ./images/patches/p 
%03d.hdr -m sky_glow -w test.oct

Has anyone come across similar results?

Thanks and Happy New Years to all.
Chris

Hi Chris,

I normally recommend using the -bn option with rtcontrib.  Not sure if  
this will fix your problem or not:

$ vwrays -ff -vf fish_up.vf | rtcontrib @rtc.opt -ffc $(vwrays -d -vf  
fish_up.vf) -e MF:2  -f reinhart.cal -bn Nrbins -b rbin -o ./images/ 
patches/p%03d.hdr -m sky_glow -w test.oct

Best,
-Greg

As always, thanks for the response Greg.

As suggested I tried adding the -bn option, however ;rtcontrib' still  
only generates 248 unfinished files with the '-e MF:2' option.  All  
works fine with 'e MF:1'.  I tried sending the files to a ramdisk, but  
still no joy.

I'm wondering if I did something funny when compiling the most recent  
head under OS X?  Has anyone had similar results using Linux or Cygwin?

Thanks,
Chris H

Ah.  Sounds like you're running up against a system limit on the  
number of open file descriptors, which is typically set to 256.  I  
don't know how to overcome this.  The ulimit command should provide  
help, but I can't get it to behave for me.

When I use reinhart.cal, I don't usually produce separate component  
files for this reason.

Best,
-Greg

I was following Axel's tutorial myself yesterday and had the same
problem that Chris describes. At least I managed to change my
file limit ...

On Mac OS X the max number of open files is limited to 256 per
user process. That's pretty low and not sufficient for any subdivision
of the Tregenza sky pattern.

To change the open files limit (on OS X!) I created a file
"/etc/launchd.conf" with the line "limit maxfiles 1024 unlimited"
and I set the kernel limit with "sysctl -w kern.maxfiles=1024".

After a reboot I could set the shell's limit with "ulimit -n 1024".
This can go into your ".profile" if you're going to use it a lot.

I had a few odd observations regarding the missing or incomplete
patch files but that seems to be solved now  (just tried it with MF:2
and it worked fine). I am still puzzled by the fact that creating all
these image doesn't seem to take much time at all (a few minutes
at max). When I tried the "vwrays | rtrace" example yesterday it
took half an hour to produce the image ...

Further down the tutorial you will have to replace the "seq"
command in Axel's scripts (not available on OS X). A simple
loop with a counter will do.

Before Axel's tutorial I didn't know about reinhart.cal and the
use of genskyvec. It feels very elegant this way; better than
doing a separate calculation for defined sun positions like
daysim.

At the moment I just have a major problem with the quantities
in my simulation. At the end I achieve roughly 10% of Axel's
example values and the TFS values look just wrong ...

Anyway, a big thanks to Axel for this introduction.

Regards,
Thomas

Forget about that. It turned out that I had a mix of MF:2
and MF:1 files on my system. After rerunning all of the
steps with MF:2 I manage to get a similar result as Axel
did.

PS:
I rewrote the gen_yearvect script to allow the input of a
MF value on the command line and replace the failed
gendaylit calls with gensky. If anyone is interested I can
send it via PM. If you're following the tutorial you can't
use it, though, because other scripts still rely on the
preset names for directories etc.

Cheers,
Thomas

Dear list,

I am having some problems in the usage of pcomb.

If I use the latest release of radiance compiled for windows 
(
pcomb -v
#?RADIANCE 
CAPDATE= 2010:02:09 19:36:42
)
on a command like:

pcomb -h -e 'lo=li(1)+li(2)+li(3)'  -o C:\image_1.pic -o C:\image_2.pic
-o C:\image_3.pic > C:\Composite.pic

I receive the error 
'lo=li(1)+li(2)+li(3)'  
^ illegal variable name

If I use an older version o pcomb (-h not supported yet) it all works
fine but I seem to be limited to 30ish images maximum, otherwise an
error (too many picture files) appears. 
As I am planning to use a large number of images composted together I
would like to get rid of the header information and not being limited to
the number of images I can process (or at least being able to handle
some 100 files at once...).

Thank you in advance for your time and help!
As usual it is very much appreciated!!

Best,

Giovanni

Have you tried to use double quotes instead of single quotes?
I noticed that there is a difference between command prompt
in Windows and shell prompt in Unix. Can't remember which
one had to use on Windows, though.

With this weekend's HEAD I noticed that the -h command does
strip the headers from the input images, but the command used
to create the output is still there in full length. I can understand
that this is the desired behaviour. If you plan to combine a large
number of pictures I would recommend another pcomb command
with a single input file just to strip this header as well.

Thomas

Thank you so much Thomas, your tip fixed the problem in one second!
Would be useful to have the right syntax on the manual page as well though...

Thanks again,

Best,

Have you tried to use double quotes instead of single quotes?
I noticed that there is a difference between command prompt
in Windows and shell prompt in Unix. Can't remember which
one had to use on Windows, though.

With this weekend's HEAD I noticed that the -h command does
strip the headers from the input images, but the command used
to create the output is still there in full length. I can understand
that this is the desired behaviour. If you plan to combine a large
number of pictures I would recommend another pcomb command
with a single input file just to strip this header as well.

Thomas

Strange. That does not explain why your command with the
older version of pcomb did succeed. Unless you used double
quotes there.

Well, you can point out every oddity of every system Radiance
runs on.

I have used that version of pcomb quite a lot and (as per the manual
page) I have always used in that format without any problem...
The radiance manual pages are my on-line bible, to be believed and never
questioned! :)

Thanks again,

Hi Randolph,

I recommend "Digital Modeling of Material Appearance" by Dorsey,  
Rushmeier and Sillion (ISBN 978-0-12-221181-2).  Section 5.7 has a  
nice explanation of scattering in volumes that covers the basic  
principles.

Message-ID: <1555777.1265909327733.JavaMail.root@ps38>

Dear all, 

I am an undergraduate student trying to model a 10m x 10m room with 
one corner touching the origin and a window on the south facing wall. I 
have been trying to model this room with a film of translucent white 
plastic on the window, and am really really stuck and need help 
urgently, any advice would help a lot! 

Firstly,  I have a translucent white plastic material with a 
reflectivity value of 0.518 and Transmissivity value 0.046, how would 
you do the parameters for this material? 

secondly, I have a model set up, and I really need to get a working 
plane with lux values on it, how do you do this in either Control Panel 
or radiance itself? I have tried to use Ecotect, but it doesnt seem to 
be able to model a translucent material very accurately. 

Thank you for your time in advance, 
Sasa

Read through the following recent post regarding making a definition of your plastic:
http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-December/006434.html

And for workplane calculations on a grid see the following thread:
http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-May/000268.html

You can probably find a lot more help throughout the forum archives.
http://www.radiance-online.org/search.html


The following command process is generalized from that post. The cnt command cycles through a two-dimensional array of values (substitute your quantity of points for Xn and Yn), the rcalc command converts to XYZ and direction vector coordinates (adjust Xo and Yo for your first point, and Xd and Yd for spacing between points, and this assumes meter facing straight up, all at same Z coordinate), rtrace does the calculation (adjust calculation options as needed), and rcalc converts the RGB output to illuminance (this is assuming lux).

cnt Xn Yn | rcalc -e \
'$1=Xo+Xd*$1;$2=Yo+Yd*$2;$3=Zo' \
-e '$4=0;$5=0;$6=1' | rtrace -I -h [options] octree \
| rcalc -e '$1=179*(.265*$1+.670*$2+.065*$3)' >

Please refer to: http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/obj/irc/doc/pubs/nrcc48165/nrcc48165.pdf to find a description of how to set the Radiance material parameters for a translucent panel.

I did follow up with LBL's archivists, and they couldn't find it.

Did it by any chance turn up?

We scanned Gregs copy and the scan was posted on our pub site last  
year; you can download at http://btech.lbl.gov/pubs
then search grynberg

we have all of our pubs posted here- almost back to illustrated  
manuscripts or at least some done on typewriters
note you can search abstracts, titles, and/or authors
for example a search for the word "daylight" in abstracts will return  
156 documents you can review and download.

So...I read it. (Thank you Greg and Stephen.) And...it pointed me to an 
earlier report. Does anyone have a copy of Grynberg's "Comparison and 
Validation of Radiance and Superlite?" Or is that another one of these 
things to be found only in Greg's closet?

It's a really interesting report--good stuff on modeling, especially. 
Different from what I expected, but then that's why one reads the 
original paper.  I wonder if an ME professor I know could help me build 
that reflectometer.

Marilyne Anderson at MIT worked on building such a reflectometer,  
using an ellipsoid rather than a sphere.  I don't know where that  
project stands at the moment.

firstly, thank you so much for your help! Iv been working on that for a 
while now and that really moved me forwards..

Just one more quick question, the .dat file I get outputs just a list 
of lux levels, how do you export this into a tst file? or at least 
seperate the values by a comma as then I could import it into excel..as 
when i just change the file name to txt the list of numbers converts to 
just a long string of numbers which aren't separated in any way..

Thank you in advance!

Sasa.

Can you please be more specific about your problem?
In which context are you creating these *.dat files, which application
are you using and what is the command you use to create the files (if
you know that).

If the *.dat files contain only a single value per line (lux level)
then there should be another file that contains coordinates. Usually
this has the form "x y z dx dy dz" (no comma!). Excel can import these
files even if there is no comma in the line. You just have to set the
field separator correctly.

Regards,
Thomas

I usually find that for some reason if you assign the *.dat files to open with Excel, they open correctly without changing the extension (tabs are interpreted as column breaks). On the other hand, if you change the extension to .txt and force it to open with Excel, it doesn't do the formatting as you'd like it. For correct display of the text files in Excel 2007 try the Data menu tab, Text To Columns function. I forget what it's called in Excel 2003 and older, but I believe still in the data menu.

You can simply use the first bit of the command to generate the x,y,z file:

cnt 20 20 | rcalc -e '$1=1.3+0.470*$1;$2=1.300+0.470*$2;$3=1;' > coords.dat

Then use coords.dat and output.dat separately.

Alternatively, change the command so it writes the coords into the
output.dat file:

cnt 20 20 | rcalc -e '$1=1.3+0.470*$1;$2=1.300+0.
470*$2;$3=1;$4=0;$5=0;$6=1'\
| rtrace -I -h -oov -ab 2 phfinalwithshelf.oct\
| rcalc -e '$1=$1;$2=$2;$3=$3;$4=179*(.265*$4+.670*$5+.065*$6)'>output.dat

Mind the additional "-oov" and the use of $1 through $6.

The "output.dat" file will not contain "x y z lux" per line with tabs
between them. Excel should not have a problem with that.

Thomas

That obviously should read "... will now contain ..."

Hi All,

This is the first time i've tried using gendaylit on my Mac with Radiance 3.9 at home and i keep getting a segmentation fault error.
I've tried recompiling several times and can't seem to get around it.    Thanks for any suggestions.  

For example, issuing the following command:
gendaylit 4 13 7 -a 40.3 -o 79.9 -m 75 -W 401 41

returns:
# gendaylit 4 13 7 -a 40.3 -o 79.9 -m 75 -W 401 41
Segmentation fault

Hi Galen,

Try grabbing the latest HEAD from www.radiance-online.org and compile  
the modified version of gendaylit included there. It doesn't seem to  
have this problem.  I get:

% gendaylit 4 13 7 -a 40.3 -o 79.9 -m 75 -W 401 41

Hi Galen.

Which version of OS X are you using. I updated to Snow Leopard on a
32-bit system and since then most of the applications I compiled
myself end in a segfault. I think the new Xcode is not set up properly
for a 32-bit system or the usual (auto)config rules do not work
correctly for this configuration.

Exception: I downloaded the Radiance HEAD snapshot last weekend and it
compiled and worked fine, including gendaylit. Greg's Makefiles seem
to work just fine.

Regards,
Thomas

Hi George,

You want to check out the manpage for "ies2rad", which is the Radiance
utility for converting an ies photometry file to a Radiance light source.
There are a bunch of options so read it over carefully, but it works very
well. ies2rad will read in the ies file and create a luminous source based
on the dimensions it finds in the ies file. The output is two files: a
.rad file that describes the luminaire and a .dat file that describes the
distribution. Using replmarks, another utility in Radiance, you can place
"markers" in your model that can be replaced with the luminaires you
create with the ies2rad utility.

Hi Randolph,

Sorry for the delayed response.  I think this is another report buried  
in a box somewhere in my basement, but it's probably not worth digging  
out.  Although the work was well-done by Anat, it compares a very old  
version of Radiance to Superlite, and in it I seem to remember we  
discovered the problem of not subdividing large area sources (such as  
windows) for nearby points.  This led to the creation of the -ds  
option.  Otherwise, the programs were in fair agreement.

Cheers,
-Greg

Ooops! Hit the wrong button & a partial reply went out.

ies2rad does the basic job, but additional effort is required to 
combine the imported photometry with luminaire geometry. I'm working on 
a program to make this easier, but it's not quite alpha yet.

What's your situation? What are you trying to do?

Be especially careful with the units and lamp color look-up, most people
normalize to white as long as there are no different lamp types involved
in a project. It may be a good idea to place some measurement points and
get the illuminance from rtrace to verify everything is fine - IES file
handling is rather messy in my experience.

Barjesh.

When you say you installed Radiance "as per instructions" did you
follow the Unix instructions and compiled Radiance within cygwin or
did you install Windows binaries?

If you installed Windows binaries you actually do not need cygwin. You
can run the individual programs from the Windows command prompt. The
executables should be located in C:\Radiance3.9\bin\.

If you installed Radiance the Unix way check where the binaries have
been installed. The should be in "/usr/local/bin" (path within cygwin)
or perhaps somewhere in "/opt". Search for a file called "oconv" in
these directories. Here is a command that will help:

    find /usr/local -name oconv

(replace "/usr/lcoal" if you want to search somewhere else). If that
does not return a path to oconv then your installation was probably
not successful. Please provide more details about your installation
process.

If you get a path from that try to use the full path in your command at first:

/usr/local/bin/oconv room.rad > test.oct

If that works you just have to set your PATH environment variable to
include /usr/local/bin. You probably also have to set RAYPATH to help
Radiance find commonly used files.

Regards,
Thomas

My ltview utility is also useful for checking distribution, and that
orientation was translated the way you expected. It wraps your luminaire in
a 4' square box, places your eye looking along the +y and sets -ds .15 -ab 1
to get a decent view of the light. If working in different units, you can
use the -bs option to scale the "box size" so it's reigned in appropriately.

You can download a copy here:
http://www.rumblestrip.org/downloads/files/ltview.tgz

...and there's a short, stupid post on it here:

Hi!

If you want a direct export without the 3ds workaround, Schorsch has a 
dxf2rad that allows that as part of his commercial products.

If you go 3ds, which will break all your surfaces into triangles, it is 
possible to use Blender to do some "healing" on the mess. I usually 
export the 3ds by layername, so that all objects (triangles then) from 
one layer become one object. In Blender, I only have to select one by 
one (but the number of objects is limited to the number of layers, so 
that is fine) and de-triangulate the surfaces of the objects. Finally I 
export the whole model as OBJ - which is supported in Radiance almost as 
well as the native scene language ;-)

Cheers, Lars.

Message-ID: <694e132c1002261547u3816d691k1637d50bfa675d85@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list,

I was beginning an attempt to look at annual illuminance using the
information in a weather file (Energy Plus). As an initial test, I
used gensky while providing explicitly the direct normal radiation and
diffuse horizontal radiation from the weather file.
There was no actual geometry in the scene, just the sun, sky, skyglow,
etc. I then tested the illuminance with rtrace -I for a sensor
directed in the +Z direction as well as looking directly at the sun
where ever it was at that time.

What I found was that at the end of the day, the sensor point directly
facing the sun spikes dramatically. I've tried it with two different
weather files with similar results. Also, other sensor points pointed
in the general direction of the sunset spike correspondingly.

Here are links to two images, each showing the hourly averages for the
month of June:

Abu Dhabi: http://i49.tinypic.com/cnuhw.png
New York: http://i47.tinypic.com/20gz991.png

Does anybody have any insight to what may be causing this?

Cheers,

Hi David,

In the case of "cnuhw.png," it looks like you are specifying a  
horizontal irradiance due to direct solar that is pretty high all the  
way to sunset.  Since the direct horizontal is proportional to the  
sine of the solar altitude, and this goes to zero as the sun nears the  
horizon, the corresponding radiance of the sun has to increase  
dramatically to compensate.

A more realistic scenario would have the direct horizontal component  
dropping to zero as the sun reaches the horizon.  My guess is that  
your weather files aren't calibrated properly to the hour, or their  
direct measurements actually include a significant diffuse component.

Does anyone else have experience with this?

Cheers,
-Greg

I would recommend you double-check that you're pulling the right columns 
from the EPW file. If you're following the documentation in "Weather 
Data Information" on
http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/weatherdata_format_def.cfm
then the columns are counted 1,2,3,4,5,flags,6,7,... so that it easy to 
get confused. It's also likely that the script which you have written 
counts the fields starting with 0, not 1 like in the documentation.

Can you let us know which date your processing that produces the evening 
spike?

Thirdly, have you considered using gendaylit instead of gensky? 
gendaylit works really well with the Abu Dhabi data, and only produces 
one error in the entire year (not counting a dozen or so 'zenith 
warnings'). This probably means that the sky conditions in Abu Dhabi are 
rather Californian (or British ;-)

You cannot do it using the libraries of the opendwg alliance (or 
whatever it was called). So basically you either support only anything 
but the ACIS stuff (well, this means that you build you models 
completely out of 3dfaces), or you stay away from Autocad. Which is a 
general rule, as they step-by-step removed all(!) exporters to 
non-Autodesk formats to lock in users. As soon as you move to 
standard-CAD-formats (such as step, iges, ...) you will have a choice of 
tools to do the conversion. Take a look at brlcad for example, it is a 
great conversion tool for 3d-geometry. But of course they support 
documented open standards, not propietary file-formats.

Cheers, Lars.

You cannot do it using the libraries of the opendwg alliance (or 
whatever it was called). So basically you either support only anything 
but the ACIS stuff (well, this means that you build you models 
completely out of 3dfaces), or you stay away from Autocad. Which is a 
general rule, as they step-by-step removed all(!) exporters to 
non-Autodesk formats to lock in users. As soon as you move to 
standard-CAD-formats (such as step, iges, ...) you will have a choice of 
tools to do the conversion. Take a look at brlcad for example, it is a 
great conversion tool for 3d-geometry. But of course they support 
documented open standards, not propietary file-formats.

Cheers, Lars.

Dear all,

I've been re-reading some of the sections in RwR,
and started pondering about graphical methods which might
help in determining good settings for -av and -ad.

For demonstrating the concept, I've rendered some glow cups
into a simple test room. The cups form iso-elevation bands
in 10 deg steps that are all at the same distance from the
sensor position and are 2 deg wide. The blue band is at
elevation zero. Red ones are below the working plane, green
ones above it. This is an equiangular projection as seen
from the position of the sensor:

http://www.luxal.eu/pickup/images/cball_sensor.jpg

Here is my train of thought:

a) Stratified Monte-Carlo projection for -ad
============================================

When taking interior illuminance measurements, it's
important to make sure that all windows are hit by at least
one of the ambient sampling rays. When the windows are
fairly small and/or very far away, setting -ad appropriately
can be tricky. Raphael's tutorial, rc97tut.pdf on
http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/index.html has a table
on page 38 listing -ad against the required angular
resolution down to 1 degree.

I was wondering about a more visual approach to do this. The
ambient samples are not sent out with a cosine correction,
like an 'inverted' lux meter would do. Instead, a what is
termed stratified approach is taken which is essentially a
projection of the hemisphere onto the plane that ensures
each are of the projection is identical to every other area.
I'm not entirely sure if this can be called an 'equi-area
projection', but it probably can.

RwR, 2ed, pp. 536--537

To put this in other words: If we generate a special fisheye
view that has the same properties as the 'stratification
projection' employed by Radiance's Monte Carlo sampling, we
can visually judge if the image dimensions are sufficiently
large to ensure that even small window openings show up as
at least one bright pixel. The number of pixels in the
smallest image that allows us to see all of our small/far
away windows would then be the equivalent to the minimal
required -ad setting. Each ring in the image below has the
same area:

http://www.luxal.eu/pickup/images/cball_equiarea.jpg

Unlike the MC sampling that sends out the rays randomly
within each area of the stratified region, the rays in the
image do not have any jitter if we use a cal file and rtrace
to compute the view. This is because rtrace does not have
rpict's -pj option. For this reason, it's probably safe to
set the -ad to a little more than the number of pixels in
the just-about-big-enough image.

Furthermore, the sensor can only see above the working plane
and the corners of the fisheye projection would not
contribute to the ambient illuminance. Counting just the
pixels in the image would thus overestimate the required
samples: area_circle = 0.785 * area_square. We might use
this discrepancy as a safety margin.

b) The crystal ball: Setting -av
================================

RwR, 2ed, p 552, ch 12.2.1 Computing Indirect Irradiance:

"This ambient value is set by the -av option, given in units
of watts/steradian/m2. It corresponds to the average
radiance measured in all directions over the visible scene
(excluding light sources) and is used in place of a locally
computed average from hemisphere samples."

This again appears to be the job for a special projection.
This time, what we need is an 'equi-solid-angle' projection
of the sphere. Because we don't want 'dead' corners in the
projection, we'll project onto a cylinder.

http://www.luxal.eu/pickup/images/cball_equisolidangle.jpg

Ensuring that all our windows are accounted for (see a)
above), we can simply render an image with this projection,
and let pvalue and total work out the average. It's
probably a good idea to take the weighted average of R,G,B
to avoid any colour cast. We place the crystal ball in the
corner of the room this is furthest away from any window.

It is also important to exclude any direct light sources
that might be visible, so we set -dv-.

This, I believe, should produce good ambient value for the
scene.

Does this all make sense?

Cheers

Axel

Thanks for the summary, the confirmation of my intuition, & the cite of 
brl-cad, which I'd only vaguely been aware of.

I think it might be possible to get around Autodesk's restrictions by 
writing a script that would run in the AutoCAD environment. Such a 
script, I think, could directly create files in an export format. It 
would have to be quite a script, though!

I looked at AutoCAD scripting for a while but I found that a simple
"scripted" solution will only allow you access to a few element types
but not the whole set.

The best solution to get polygons out of AutoCAD still seems to be
3DSOUT. If that some day is incompatible or not available for the
next AutoCAD release then we will probably have to spend even
more money on some other apps like Rhino or Max and hope that
they can import AutoCAD and export polygons.

Regards,
Thomas

Dear David,

Did you maybe mix up direct normal and direct horizontal radiation data?
I have seen this type of graph in the past when Daysim users tried to
run an annual illuminance simulation using their own radiation data. You
could try to simply run an empty scene in Daysim loading in your epw
file.

Best,

Christoph

Hi David,

In the case of "cnuhw.png," it looks like you are specifying a  
horizontal irradiance due to direct solar that is pretty high all the  
way to sunset.  Since the direct horizontal is proportional to the  
sine of the solar altitude, and this goes to zero as the sun nears the  
horizon, the corresponding radiance of the sun has to increase  
dramatically to compensate.

A more realistic scenario would have the direct horizontal component  
dropping to zero as the sun reaches the horizon.  My guess is that  
your weather files aren't calibrated properly to the hour, or their  
direct measurements actually include a significant diffuse component.

Does anyone else have experience with this?

Cheers,
-Greg
