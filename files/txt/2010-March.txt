Hi Guys

Has anybody tried microstation?

I downloaded V8 XM last year. After thirty days it reverts to 15 minute
sessions but apart from that is still FULLY FUNCTIONAL!

The import / export is infinitely better than anything Autodesk: IGES,
Parasolid, STL, STEP, ACIS, Sketchup, Collada, CGM and DWG/ DXF!

It's a bit of a pain to get used to after Autocad but at least you can get
it talking to blender and sketchup.

I looked at AutoCAD scripting for a while but I found that a simple
"scripted" solution will only allow you access to a few element types
but not the whole set.

The best solution to get polygons out of AutoCAD still seems to be
3DSOUT. If that some day is incompatible or not available for the
next AutoCAD release then we will probably have to spend even
more money on some other apps like Rhino or Max and hope that
they can import AutoCAD and export polygons.

Thomas

David,

As it happens, I use the EPW Abu Dhabi weather data to illustrate a  
point re: the Pearls Design System (sort of LEED specifically for Abu  
Dhabi). A visualisation of direct normal and diffuse horizontal  
illuminances doesn't show the effect you refer to -- scroll down to  
section 'Abu Dhabi climate':

http://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm/doku.php?id=academic:daylight-compliance

[See page 'Daylight and Compliance' if the link gets mangled by your  
mailer.]

I had a closer look at the weather file data and it seems OK.

I have noticed an effect when processing weather files that can result  
in direct normal illuminances steadily (and unrealistically)  
increasing throughout the day.  However, that happens when direct  
normal has to be calculated from global horizontal and diffuse  
horizontal.  An offset in the time calibration of just half an hour  
can result in massive sunset values for direct normal.  Also, I have  
come across EPW files where the the direct normal in particular can be  
dodgy -- perhaps because it was derived from other quantities with  
flakey time calibration.

None of this however helps to explain what you noticed.  Also, I would  
have thought that your method would have resulted in a more-or-less  
exact match between weather file direct normal and predicted direct  
normal (ab=0).  I'm guessing you are aiming your sensor towards the  
sun using the direction vectors you get from gensky, yes?

I'm puzzled too.

Hi Carlos,
Hi Radiance group,

we are currently working on an update of photon mapping to the current
Radiance version and fixing a bug with the -I option of the
rtrace-version of photon-mapping.
In addition to this we are implementing photon-mapping into daysim.

I will announce it as soon when it is available (photon-mapping within
the next 6 weeks, daysim-photon-mapping takes a little bit longer).

Message-ID: <694e132c1003021605o2b27d2fbgbadb99571da24f07@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Radiance gurus,

First, thank you all very much for your help and suggestions. I also
should have mentioned that I initially turned to Daysim, but it was
having trouble with the geometry, and the only way to get the geometry
to compile was to use meshes.

I guess I have two actual questions out of all of this:
A. If I wanted to get a Radiance scene description that would [best]
match the climate, what are the best data to use as inputs?
B. Is gendaylit a prudent way forward instead of gensky CIE skies for
this climate? What about other climates?

So, keeping those in mind, let's see if I can address some other
people's questions:
1. I double checked everything and am quite certain I was picking the
right columns (see test code below email).
2. As far as Greg's thought about basically having a large intensity
to generate high enough horizontal illuminance values, shouldn't that
be the case in the morning as well?
3. I had never used gendaylit before, but gave that a chance. I'm
unsure how to catch errors on the output though, so I ended up
ignoring the errors (script assumes illuminance is 0 and outputs that
instead).
4. I also ran an empty Daysim scene using the same weather file (60
minute step) with a sensor point at 0 0 0 in direction 0 0 1. I pulled
in the .ill file to the mix to compare it to the rest as well.
5. The vector to the sun is parsed out of gensky output, I assume that
it is very similar to the gendaylit vector, but I didn't check.

I ended up running the test loop over again with these additional bits
of information as well as plotting the actual information within the
weather file.

I've posted a chart of the June hourly averages for Abu Dhabi here:
http://i47.tinypic.com/2r7a98m.png

Some thoughts:
+ I have a lot of confidence in the Daysim and gendaylit outputs that
seem to follow each other and other lines' trends.
+ I haven't looked at the Radmap code to see how it handles the
information, and I'm only part way through wrapping my head around
some of the annual simulation readings that were recently introduced
to the list.
+ I've read the ASHRAE papers on how the weather files were made. It's
like making laws or sausages - best not to look behind the scenes if
you want to appreciate them.

Any further insight is appreciated. Again, thank you.

Cheers,

--Dave

Hi David,

John mentioned that a half hour variance can create massive spikes in direct normal irradiance at sunset when calculated from horizontal irradiance data.   I think you have such a discrepancy at the root of your problem.

Irradiance data in weather files is typically the average over the previous hour.  So the irradiance for 10:00 is actually the average irradiance from 9:00 to 10:00.   If this is true of your weather data, then you should subtract  a half hour from the time in the weather data for your gensky command.  That way you are using the average sun position over the hour rather than the ending sun position.

Best,
Andy

Hi David.

I have played with gendaylit recently and also thought about the
problems it has.

On Wed, Mar 3, 2010 at 12:05 AM, David Smith <dbs176@gmail.com> wrote:

Given the information available in data files and the input our
generators expect using radiation data seems to be a good choice. It
might be more accurate to use illuminance data instead and divide this
by Radiance's built in sky efficacy of 179. If you use irradiance and
solar radiance you imply that the sky has this same efficacy, which is
not true. However, illuminance data is not always available (EPW files
do have this information, other climate files do not).

BTW: I noticed in your plot that you labeled the gensky parameters as
"-B" and "-r". I think you have to use "-r" because the information in
the EPW file is direct _normal_ radiance not direct _horizontal_
irradiance. This might well be the cause of your odd spikes because
with "-R" you ask for a cosine correction which will be quite extreme
for low angles.

I hope someone can confirm this because I don't know too much about
the EPW file. I just found the units for the various radiation data.
Direct normal is given in Wh/m2. Does that mean we have to convert to
Wh/sr/m2 if we want to use it with "-r" or apply a cosine correction
if we want to use "-R"?

Gensky implements a number of sky models (uniform, overcast,
intermediate and clear). When you use gensky you will have to decide
which of the models you want to use. There is not much guidance on how
to do this. You could go by cloud cover and visibility if you have
that information.

Gendaylit does not need this information. It will calculate the
brightness distribution based on the radiation input which makes it
much easier to use in a script.

There are certainly sky conditions where neither of the models creates
an accurate description. Depending on the climate this might be true
for a large number of the records in the climate data file. However,
without an alternative you have to make a choice which of these models
you want to use and hope that over the whole year these errors have no
significant impact on the distribution.

Yep. Script seems fine.

Axel has used gendaylit with loads of climate data records recently
and came up with two basic error scenarios:

a) The direct component is 0. Some records refer to a time where the
sun is actually not visible and more. Gendaylit can't handle that and
so it will create no output at all. You can help yourself here by
adjusting the time as Andrew proposed until the sun is above the
horizon again.

b) Gendaylit simply segfaults. This seems to be rare. Perhaps cheating
with the values a bit might help (change by a few % or so) or simply
replace that sky with a gensky generated one which seems to be more
generous in what it accepts.

Still, it's worth validating the generated sky as you did in your
graphs to see how big the error actually is. That will give you an
idea of how accurate your simulation results are going to be.

Thomas

Message-ID: <C7B56E83.2C0A%robert.guglielmetti@nrel.gov>

Anyone seen this before? I issue a simple rpiece command, like:

Rpiece @args &

The args file has some basic stuff in it:

-x 1024 -y 1024 -vf foo.vf -o foo.hdr foo.oct

When I issue the command, a zillion bash shells get spawned (can see them in
top) and after a few seconds the following errors print to the screen:

./rpiece: fork: Resource temporarily unavailable
./rpiece: line 3: RADIANCE: command not found
./rpiece: line 4: -vtv: command not found
./rpiece: line 7: -Y: command not found

...followed by a bunch of garbage characters. Anyone know what's going on
here?

It looks like your system isn't case sensitive. Rpiece is 
interpreting that as a request for a rendering in 1M parts.

Hi Mark,

But my system *is* case sensitive. It's running OSX and it's a standard
POSIX compliant bash shell. You mean it's interpreting the -x as -X?

Rob,

That's the easiest explanation for the symptoms that you are 
seeing. I hope someone else can explain why it got triggered on 
your system.

Hi Rob,

Are you setting -X and -Y in @args? Are you using a syncfile with -F?

Hi Jack,

I am specifying -x and -y (lowercase) in the args, and specifying a syncfile
with -F (in args). Mark thinks that my system is somehow interpreting -x
1024 -y 1024 as -X 1024 and -Y 1024.

?

Hey Rob,

Well it does seem a bit odd. I believe that rpiece defaults to -X = 4 
and -Y = 4, if nothing is specified on the command line.

It does look like too many copies are being forked though, thus all the 
bash shells getting spawned and the error message for fork indicating 
that no more resources are available.

Perhaps as one test it would be worth explicitly setting -X and -Y and 
seeing what happens? Is this a standard system you are running on or a 
cluster of some sort?

-Jack

Actually now that I think about this, the forking has to do with 
something else, -X and -Y only specify how an image gets divided up not 
processes.... (it has been awhile since I have actually looked at how 
this works).

Perhaps another test would be to run (1) rpiece instance with the 
arguments explicitly at the command line (eg not in @args)....

Is it possible the code that generates the @-file is putting an upper 
case '-X' in it? Is it perhaps a Windows shell?

I used OSX to create a simple args file from the command line for testing purposes, so there's no case funny-stuff going on in that regard. No, not a Windows shell (not at all!). I didn't have a chance to just test with all the args on the command line today, as Jack recommended, but will try tomorrow.

You have not specified either the "-X -Y" resolution or an existing
syncfile that rpiece should use to coordinate the processes. Rpiece
should treat that as a command error but apparently it doesn't.

Anyway, add either one of the options to tell rpiece how to chop up
the image and you should be fine.

Careful, Rob.

The bash is case sensitive, but the OS X file system is not (by default).

Hi Thomas, 

I did specify a syncfile. Sorry I guess I left that out in my summary. There is a -F (syncfile) in the args too. The syncfile was simply created at the bash prompt with "echo 1 8 > syncfile", so it should not have any character or line ending issues. I will try leaving it all out there on the command line when I get in to the office today.

Thomas you mention that OSX is not case sensitive by default? I have never seen this behavior. How does one ensure that it is behaving in a case sensitive manner? Case insensitivity is kind of a problem with rpiece since there are -x and -X, -y and -Y options that are important!

Hi Rob,

Thomas is referring to the fact that filenames on the default OS X  
filesystem are not case-sensitive, so "Foo.dat" is the same as  
"fOo.DaT".  If you create the former, you can refer to it as the  
latter.  It will still show up with the case you created it with, but  
the system silently ignores case when you refer to it.  You can't have  
both "Foo.dat" and "fOo.dat" in the same directory -- creating the  
latter would overwrite the former.

This has nothing to do with what goes into a bash script, or how  
rpiece gets its options.  Only on older Windows systems is case  
ignored in the command line itself.  I don't know when that stopped  
being true, but I don't think that's true any longer.

I am as puzzled by the behavior you're seeing as everyone else.   
Without having all your files and scripts, though, it's pretty  
difficult to reproduce.

Cheers,
-Greg

Message-ID: <1AA13BAB-4DBD-492D-82D3-EB41D5B28ADF@gmail.com>

As some of you know, Jan Wienhold has offered to host this year's  
Radiance workshop at the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy (ISE)  
in Freiburg, Germany.

We have been discussing dates for the workshop, and so far, our  
favorites are:

	September 22nd-24th (Wed-Fri)

Second choice dates would be:

	October 6th-8th (also Wed.-Fri.)

We're floating these dates out to the group in case there is an  
important conference or conflict that makes the first week  
unfavorable.  (It's not so much that we're asking for everyone to vote  
their favorite.)  If you do know of a significant conflict with either  
set of dates, please write to the list for further discussion.

Cheers,
-Greg

Problem solved. I had an *image* called "rpiece" in the current working
directory (and . in my search path). I'm not exactly sure what causes that
to spawn all these bash shells, but obviously my system was very confused.
Thanks for all the suggestions and the insights on case sensitivity.

And thanks to Mark for his runsmp script (in the benchmark package), which
does a nice job of keeping my processors busy (it's hot under my desk!).

Weird.  Normally, image files and the like aren't "executable" -- you  
must have had that bit set on your file, somehow, and the OS  
interpreted the header as a bash script.  No wonder you had such a mess!

Yeah, I don't know how it could have been set as executable either, and I
already deleted the file so I can't even know for sure, but that must have

Makes sense - if the image had been created by rpiece and gets executed,
 the header lines listing all commands to generate the image will be
processed just as in a script.

Greg

Do you know any good radiance developers in the Chicago area available for
contract work?

They have to be able to handle complex daylighting not just windows

You can see our product that needs to be incorporated into the model at
www.solar-track.com


Thanks

George

Weird.  Normally, image files and the like aren't "executable" -- you  
must have had that bit set on your file, somehow, and the OS  
interpreted the header as a bash script.  No wonder you had such a mess!

hi... as you may remember, I had the chance to have a closer look at  
your products. You do not need a programmer for modelling this.  
Technically the photon map extension is essential for you. modelling  
may require some cheats (especially if you have bent pipes attached)  
and scripting to make the mirror system track the sun. Still no  
programming.

Hi George,

I can't think of anyone in the Chicago area off-hand, but others on  
the list may be able to refer you (or suggest themselves).

It looks like the elements in your system are diffusing, which means  
you could probably model them with standard Radiance using the mkillum  
program.  Most advanced users who apply Radiance to daylighting  
problems should be familiar with this method, and could help you.  It  
would require some scripting as Lars points out, but this is pretty  
standard in the context of daylighting problems.

Best,
-Greg

Hi Greg, George,
actually that is an interesting question whether it can be considered  
diffusing. a lensplate strays light, but it is not diffuse (if it was  
it had to look white from below). Still it may be a valid approach to  
treat it as diffuse in a model.
Cheers
Lars.

If the surfaces are "partly specular" then you can still treat it in  
mkillum.  If it is purely specular, or has a purely specular  
component, it gets a bit more complicated and you'd have to use the  
mirror type, but mkillum would still work so long as the surfaces are  
flat.  The photon mapping method really only applies when your  
surfaces are both highly specular and curved, which I don't think is  
the case, here.

Cheers,
-Greg

Subject: [Radiance-general] rtcontrib and rtrace-parameters
Message-ID: <1606003220815333702@LAPTOP2>

Dear radiance gurus,

based on Axel?s extremely helpful tutorial, I started to use rtcontrib. At the end of the day the target is annual daylight simulation, but at the moment there are questions quite at the beginning.
I have a small test room, quite similar to Axel?s without any sun protection. I did two rtrace runs for clear sky conditions. The first sky (k4) gives direct sun for the first two measurement points, with the second sky (k5) there is no sun entering the room.
For the rtcontrib run I use reinhart.cal and compared two MF-settings (2 and 4). The rtrace-options are -ab 6 -ad 4096 -as 2048 -aa 0 -dj 1 -lw 2e-10.
With this settings I get the distributions in Graph1 http://www.meinalbum.at/Foto-LRSDFU3V-D.jpg
To get the distribution I use genskyvec.
Additional I did some rtrace runs with the same options und compared the results for sky k4 in the second graph http://www.meinalbum.at/Foto-CKMDQR4R-D.jpg

To this results the are some questions:
1.) Are this useful rtrace-options, am I on the right track?
2.) What can I do, to get closer to the rtrace-results?
3.) MF=2 seems to get smoother results, than MF=4 - dose that make sense?   
4.) Can I reduce the differences between different rtrace-runs with the identical options?

Any comments are very appreciated.

Thank you
Martin Klingler

Yes -- I missed that.  If there's an attached (specular) light pipe, I  
agree that the photon map would be the best way to go.  You could  
still get by with mkillum and standard Radiance in cases where the sun  
was not striking the curved light pipe directly, only after bouncing  
off the diffuse or semi-specular reflectors, but I'm not sure what the  
case is here.

Thanks for pointing that out.

Hi,

I just wanted to draw your attention to the fact that the main reference 
for Radiance is not available. The cheapest price for "Rendering with 
Radiance" at amazon.com as of today is 1000$ for a used copy. Booksurge 
gives 0 results on a search. I wonder whether making the book available 
as a paid pdf would not be better then not having it at all. This is a 
big problem for application of the software, as anyone using it gets 
pointed to this book as a reference, but no one could buy it. I have 
been trying to buy a copy for an institute here for one year without any 
success. Besides preventing potential users from starting with Radiance, 
this increases the amount of beginners questions, that had been answered 
in the book.

Cheers

Lars.

Hi Lars,

This has been a problem for a while, as you know. A grand for a used copy on Amazon now, eh? WOW. Last time I checked, people were asking ~$300 for a copy, but that was years ago. I feel old, because I bought my copy of RwR by plucking a freshly-published copy off the shelf at my local bookstore a few blocks from work, but this was in nineteen ninety-(cough)! =8-)

Seriously, the issue in the past is that Greg and Charles Ehrlich's supreme efforts were thwarted by what seemed to be a lousy print-on-demand publisher they secured a few years ago. I know they were going to look into other publishers and I think that hard copy was the way they wanted to work it. I do not know if they are close to finding a new publisher.

This is one of those recurring conversations, and I know it must seem  
incredible that we haven't managed to sort this out in all the time  
we've had to spend on it.  The fact is, all of us have day jobs, and  
no one knows how publishing works (other than the publishers).   
Creating a new printing of a book, even a reprinting, somehow requires  
small, meaningless (to us) changes in the ISBN and/or Library of  
Congress number, which we don't know how to do.  Rob Shakespeare has  
lined up a new printer, but they need to secure the rights from the  
old printer, and none of us are sure what's going on with that, either.

I'll use this as a reminder to get on it again, and if we can't  
resolve it by Summer, I think we'll just release the PDF to the world  
and solve it that way.  It's my least favorite solution, but at least  
it is a solution.

Best,
-Greg

I think you wanted to write 'rtcontrib runs' - at least that's what your
labels say.

When you use genskyvec you also remove the sun 'source' from the sky
description and distribute its brightness to the surrounding sky patches.
rtace treats a sky with sun differently than a sky without sun. Therefore
you will not achieve identical results from rtrace and rtcontrib.

That obviously depends on your scene complexity. If you have blinds in front
of your window I would say that the results you get are sufficiently
accurate for climate data studies.

If you have a simple geometry like in Axel's tutorial I think that the -as
2048 is overkill. You already have a high -ad setting which should account
for window openings in a typical room.

Effectively you have turned off ambient caching by setting -aa to 0.
rtcontrib does not use ambient caching anyway so that's probably not going
to make a difference. Ambient caching might have smoothed out your
individual point results a bit.

Your -dj value seems high, but given that there are no sources it should not
matter.


> 2.) What can I do, to get closer to the rtrace-results?

As I said above, you can not reproduce the direct calculation with
genskyvec. You could split out the direct component and do a separate
calculation just for the sun. It will just make things far more complicated,
though.

You could try and switch off Monte Carlo sampling with '-u-'. That should
give you a deterministic sampling pattern which should result in 'identical'
values.

rtcontrib-runs?

Perhaps you should investigate where the error originates in your
calculation chain. When you use rtcontrib to calculate illuminance values at
a point the only value affected by the rtrace options is the contribution of
each sky patch. This is only a fraction of the 'brightness' the patch is
ultimately assigned so small variations in the contribution can result in
noticeable changes of the illuminance values. I would start by comparing the
patch contributions between rtcontrib runs. If they are reasonably constant
your error is introduced somewhere else.

IIRC the multiplier for each patch contribution is calculated via genskyvec
at specified directions (saved in tregsamp.dat). That should result in
constant values for the multipliers but you can still check.


Overall I think that your current values are sufficiently accurate. In the
end you will apply these values to a large number of (inaccurate) sky
descriptions to then calculate an average from all these results. The error
you introduce by the use of insufficient sky models should largely exceed
the error resulting from the rtcontrib/genskyvec process.

Anyway, good that there is more interest in validating climate data
calculations.

Thomas

Message-ID: <BF35B0A4E2142940B9C69BB4D6E505A203C901@EXMS3.staff.ad.curtin.edu.au>

Hello list,

I am having folder specification difficulties setting up a test ranimate across multiple computers (using samba)

My test.ran files is:
RIF= test.rif
DIRECTORY= animation_process_network
VIEWFILE= anim.vf
DISKSPACE= 100
#host= localhost 1 ~/test/current/animation_process_network masteruser
host= remote 1 ~/test/test/current/animation_process_network testuser
TRANSFER= ran2tiff -W 0.7 -h -z frame*.hdr

Notes:
1. Assume the remote workstation is called remote
2. The remote username is testuser
3. The master usernmae is masteruser
4. I have commented out the localuser host as this works
5. ssh has been set up using RSA keys pairings
   Setup ssh key pairs:
   On the host system: ssh-keygen -t rsa (use enter for no passhrase)
   ssh-copy-id -i /home/masteruser/.ssh/id_rsa.pub testuser@remote
6. Samba mount:
   ssh testuser@remote
   smbmount //master/masteruser ~/test -o username=masteruser

On the host system I start the process with:
ranimate test.ran >& animation_process_network/anim.err

The anim.err file shows:
Process started on remote
remote: Error output from: rpict @animation_process_network/render.opt -vp -505.575 812.796 321.761 -vd 0.608355 -0.458502 -0.436495 -vu 0.396724 -0.283029 0.873215 -vh 56.547 -vv 41.1546 -w0 -o animation_process_network/frame%03d.unf -x 3708 -y 1644 -S 1 octrees/test.oct < animation_process_network/anim.vf
bash: line 0: cd: ~masteruser: No such file or directory
bash: animation_process_network/anim.vf: No such file or directory
ranimate: error rendering frames 1 through 3

1. What is confusing is where does the 'masteruser' come from (it is the username on the master workstation) when processing on the remote workstation the username is testuser!
2. Is the 'local directory' parameter on the host line (parameter 3) suppose to point to the same folder as the test.ran file is located (ie the same location as in the localhost line). Obviously on the remote workstation this folder 'smbmount' at some point x in the local filesystem.
3. The rpict command when run on the remote workstation works quite happily in the same folder.

I am using Linux - specifically Kubuntu 9.10 and radiance-3R9+20090811-1 (latest version)

Hi Terrance!

Can you replace the ~ by the absolute path? I guess that the home
directory get resolved on the master and not one the slave nodes of your
rendering cluster. Would be worth trying, unfortunately I cannot test it
right now.

Cheers, Lars.

Hi Terrance,

I remember having to deal with this a while back, but I do not recall 
exactly the solution. Nevertheless here are a couple of things to look at:

   1. ssh - you may need to set the environment for ssh, when used this
      way (eg ssh command_to_run) it does not use the PATH information
      found for your standard login shell, you can set the correct PATH
      and RAYPATH. This is done in an "environment" file for ssh, check
      the man page for ssh for further information.
   2. host specification
         1. explicit path in hosts specification- I think that you might
            want try specifying an explicit path (rather than ~) to the
            location where the host needs to look for the animation
            related files. Not sure if it makes a difference, you may
            need to try out the following as tests:
               1. relative to user home dir - ../../../path_to_render_dir
               2. path from root - /path_to_render_dir
         2. mount point - I seem to recall that the easiest thing to do
            is have the mount point and user be the same on master and
            slave nodes. So if you are mounting to /RENDER which is what
            your slave (render host) nodes see then you should have this
            in your path on the master node. This way you can just cd to
            /RENDER on the master node and run  ranimate job.ranim and
            have master and slave nodes seeing the same directory
            hierarchy. And this way you do not need to specify path or
            user in the host specification, eg host= render-host 1
            rather than host= render-host 1 path_to_render_dir alt_user
         3. different users - wouldn't it be easier to just have the
            same user replicated onto the slave nodes?
   3. samba - I am not sure about this, I have never really been clear
      on the difference between the file locking protocols between samba
      and NFS, I guess I will be interested to hear if this works or
      note, however you may end up needing to use NFS.

Hope this helps.

That would mean, if I am only interested in daylight (in combination with rtcontrib), I can forget
aa and dj and reduce as.

That is a good point. I am quite sure, that the differences are coming from the
patch contributions. The calculation time for the rtcontrib run is extremely short,
at least I think so.
What are the critical parameters concerning accuracy for a rtcontrib run, I really
wouldn't have any problems with longer computation time.

OK, they are constatnt over simmilar calls to genskyvec.

Thank you for that comment. Yes that is true. But can I say that as long as I compare
different daylighting solutions with the same (inaccurate) processes, I will get still
valid results?

Many thanks and best regards

I think you wanted to write 'rtcontrib runs' - at least that's what your
labels say.

When you use genskyvec you also remove the sun 'source' from the sky
description and distribute its brightness to the surrounding sky patches.
rtace treats a sky with sun differently than a sky without sun. Therefore
you will not achieve identical results from rtrace and rtcontrib.

That obviously depends on your scene complexity. If you have blinds in front
of your window I would say that the results you get are sufficiently
accurate for climate data studies.

If you have a simple geometry like in Axel's tutorial I think that the -as
2048 is overkill. You already have a high -ad setting which should account
for window openings in a typical room.

Effectively you have turned off ambient caching by setting -aa to 0.
rtcontrib does not use ambient caching anyway so that's probably not going
to make a difference. Ambient caching might have smoothed out your
individual point results a bit.

rtcontrib-runs?

Perhaps you should investigate where the error originates in your
calculation chain. When you use rtcontrib to calculate illuminance values at
a point the only value affected by the rtrace options is the contribution of
each sky patch. This is only a fraction of the 'brightness' the patch is
ultimately assigned so small variations in the contribution can result in
noticeable changes of the illuminance values. I would start by comparing the
patch contributions between rtcontrib runs. If they are reasonably constant
your error is introduced somewhere else.

IIRC the multiplier for each patch contribution is calculated via genskyvec
at specified directions (saved in tregsamp.dat). That should result in
constant values for the multipliers but you can still check.


Overall I think that your current values are sufficiently accurate. In the
end you will apply these values to a large number of (inaccurate) sky
descriptions to then calculate an average from all these results. The error
you introduce by the use of insufficient sky models should largely exceed
the error resulting from the rtcontrib/genskyvec process.

Anyway, good that there is more interest in validating climate data
calculations.

Thanks to both Lars and Jack for your suggestions.

I will try your suggestions tonight.

   1. The different users are a pain - but not always easily resolved.
      It seems that ranimate was designed to handle different users (at
      least by the provision of the host username parameter) though I
      have not looked at the source code.
   2. I had the same errors to a different remote workstation with the
      same user name just a different folder location due to the mount
      command!
   3. I suspected there might be a 'environment' error with ssh not
      running the .bashrc - will check that out. From the errors, it
      appears that the rpict program was found and run - maybe this is a
      bogus error. Will check tonight after resolving the ssh 'environment'.

Hello Greg,

I have a need to compile radiance for my Mac OSX students who have a 
variety of versions of OSX. Can you advise what is the rmake you used to 
produce your Mac OS X (10.4 Universal)binaries. The standard makeall 
install that I used:
#!/bin/sh
exec make "SPECIAL=ogl" \
     "OPT=-O2" \
     "MACH=-DBSD -DNOSTEREO -Dfreebsd -I/usr/X11R6/include 
-L/usr/X11R6/lib " \
     ARCH=Intel "COMPAT=" \
     INSTDIR=/Applications/ray/bin \
     LIBDIR=/Applications/ray/lib \
     ESUFFIX= \
     CC=cc CONFIGURE_ARCH=i386 "$@" -f Rmakefile

only works on my Snow Leopard 10.6.2

By the way I was able to use Xcode to make an intel universal version of 
Simon Crone's genrad program, but can not figure the correct settings 
for the makeall script.

If you don't have the information then I will make up a install pkg 
using the 10.4 tar.gz from radiance-online.

Have you thought about putting a standard install package together for 
Mac OSX on the website? I have been playing with the xcode PackageMaker 
app which seems relatively easy to conjure up and is ideal for the 
complete novice to install.

Hi Terrance.

Since I upgraded to Snow Leopard I had various problems with compiling
my own binaries. Luckily, Radiance's makeall script works fine,
although I only use them on my machine.

With Snow Leopard Apple switched to gcc 4.2 and a few new core
technologies under the hood.

To produce binaries that run on 10.4 you have to install the 10.4u SDK
component of Xcode. To use it you have to set the "-isysroot" option
in gcc.

You have to use gcc 4.0 as compiler, not gcc 4.2. I think it also only
works if you produce 32bit binaries (which you would want to do
anyway).

Plus there are probably a number of other things. I recently found
that I couldn't run an application because OS X 10.5 needs to be at
the right patch level ...

All in all I now think that it is safest to compile on a 10.4 system.
This will run on 10.5 and 10.6 but is much less hassle to set up.


Just my less-than-2c,

Thomas

I would think that '-as' can be reduced but that depends on your geometry.

As far as I understand it options affecting the ambient interpolation
('-aa' and '-ar') will have no effect because rtcontrib needs to
disable the interpolation ('-aa 0'). Any source related option will
have no effect because the base sky used to calculate the patches does
not have a source. After that any sky is sampled at predefined angles
which makes most rtrace options obsolete.

Yes, that surprised me, too. I haven't done any testing on serious
scene where multiple reflections should lead to a contribution of
almost every sky patch. In my test scene at first every patch 'behind'
the window wall was ignored because there was nothing to bounce light
back into the room. The I introduced another building in front of my
room to reflect a more realistic scenario.

I don't know what good values for rtcontrib would be. It simply uses
rtrace in a fancy way so all parameters that apply to an rtrace
calculation in the same scene should be fine (see exceptions above).

Perhaps we just have to use ridiculously high '-ad' values to make
sure the sky is sampled at a high density. This would result in less
variation due to the number of rays that hit a specific sky patch.

With Radiance there will always be some 'inaccuracy'. All we can do is
try to understand where the error is introduced and how we can
estimate its magnitude (as you're doing right now). If your rtrace
results are within 5% of the rtrace results for the same scene then
that might be the built-in inaccuracy of rtcontrib.

Add that to the difference between sky model and real sky and you may
end up with 20-30% inaccuracy for the whole climate data based
approach. That's what we have to live with until we can  coax another
student into writing a better sky generator or a more accurate
rtcontrib ...

However, even with this high error margin we can now at least start to
work on daylight models that take into account the weather, seasons,
location and orientation of buildings. I won't start calculating ADF
with rtcontrib; rtrace is much better in doing that. But perhaps there
is some information to be found in a RDF ('real daylight factor') that
can efficiently only be calculated with something like rtcontrib.

Thomas

Dear Cramer,

 

We are extensively using GenCumultativeSky as part of the GSD Rhino
Toolbar for Radiance/Daysim. The toolbar is currently used in five GSD
studios and we intend to publicly release it later this year. (Matthias
is using it in his GSD class as well so you can talk to him about it.) 

 

GenCumultativeSky produces cumulative radiation maps based on EPW files.
We are properly validating it right now but I think that it will yield
very similar results to RADMAP. I got the source code form Darren
Robinson earlier this year and modified it a bit so that it can now read
in EPW files and you can select time of day and year intervals for a
more detailed analysis. If Darren is OK with it, I can share the
modified code with anybody interested.

 

BTW, this is a good way of announcing to this group that we will be
offering another three day executive education program on 'Daylighting
Buildings' on July 14-16 2010. In the program we will be covering a
range of topics from climate-based daylighting metrics to glare analysis
of simulated and real daylit spaces using HDR images generated with
Photosphere and Radiance as well as annual daylight glare probability
calculations and the above mentioned Rhino plug-in for Radiance/Daysim.

Message-ID: <001701cac07e$a4d33d80$ee79b880$@com>

Hi,
I am trying to do a similar process as below email, but with an illuminance
plot. 
I would like to know the % above a lighting threshold of 300lux in an
illumination grid output from radiance.
 
My office uses Ecotect to build daylight models with 2d analysis grids
(.pts). After running radiance the analysis grid is populated into a .dat
file that is renamed in the Ecotect Batch to a .ok file.
The .ok file consists of illumination data by point.
So when I open the .ok file in a text editor the values are in exponential
form, ie.. (1.501146e+000   1.570207e+000   9.277438e-001). 
When viewed in the Ecotect grid this value is 270.316 lux. 
 
Is there a way to have rtrace give me that percentage while the batch is
running or at least convert the data from exponential form to 'real' values?
 
Please let me know what to add to the batch, I assume it will be at the
rtrace section or after in the batch:
rtrace .rendering settings. gridtest.oct < gridtest.pts > gridtest.dat 
@RENAME gridtest3.dat gridtest3.ok 
 
Thanks,
Nick

The conversion from RGB irradiance to illuminance is:

so you can use rcalc to calculate the percentage you desire like so:

Hi,

I am not sure whether Nick wants to find out the fraction of the 
required illuminance level each point achieves (that is what Andrew 
calculates) or the fraction of (the amount of) points that meet the 
criteria. For the second you have three steps involved:

1) filter the input according to you treshold (300lx)
2) count the value meeting the criteria
3) divide by the total number of points and multiply by 100 to get a 
percentage

This can be translated like into:

 cat test.dat | rcalc -e '$1=1; $2=if($1-299,1,0)' | total | rcalc -e 
'$1=100*$2/$1'

The first step, rcalc, takes one column (you can adapt this according to 
your input file) and writes out two columns. The first is set to 1 for 
any input, the second is set to one for inputs > 2990 and to 0 for 
anything below.

The second step, total, sums up the result of the first step. You get 
the sums of two columns - two numbers, the first being the amount of 
original input values, the second the amount of values that are above 299.

The third step, rcalc again, divides the number of points meeting the 
criteria by the total number of values and multiplies this by 100. This 
results in the percentage of values meeting the criteria.

There are quicker ways to achieve this, but I wanted a transparent 
format that one can explain. Hope this helps, cheers

Lars.

Oops!  Lars you're right.  I should have looked closer at the emails Nick
referenced.

Nick, you'll need some of what I gave you to get from rtrace output to
illuminance:
rtrace ...  |  rcalc -e '$1=($1*0.265+$2*0.670+$3*0.065)*179' > test.dat

Then what Lars gave to calculate the percent of points above a threshold.

Subject: [Radiance-general] su2rad import numeric results
Message-ID: <4B9ABC0F.2090404@transsolar.com>

Hi Thomas & All

I'm experimenting with su2rad as a new way of doing our daylight studies 
(second time actually, hopefully i get a good workflow fully developed 
this time). I don't have it fully working yet, but I do have useful 
radiance geometry exports that i can use with our existing radiance 
(linux) setup. Now I just need to get results back into SketchUp. I see 
that su2rad can import "numeric results," but what format are these 
supposed to be? I'm not running radiance from sketchup yet, but I ought 
to be able to reformat the results I do have to view in SketchUp (if 
it's plain text). Can anyone out there tell me what file type/format I 
need to be using, and maybe send a sample file so I can see the 
contents? Or do I really need to get the windows-based radiance side of 
things up and running? I may be trying to put a square peg into a round 
hole...

Thanks,
Cmamer

I'm sure Thomas can aswer better, but from what I've gathered...

It will bring in results from rtrace, such as a grid of illuminance values calculated from
cnt 47 25 | rcalc -e '$1=-1.4+.1*$1;$2=-.25+.1*$2;$3=1;$4=0;$5=0;$6=1'\ | rtrace -I -h -oov -ab 5 octrees/br.oct | rcalc -e '$1=$1;$2=$2;$3=$3;$4=179*(.265*$4+.670*$5+.065*$6)' > b_roomab5.dat

b_roomab5.dat looks like...
-1.4	-0.25	2	1.8598357
-1.4	-0.15	2	2.08278938
-1.4	-0.05	2	2.17479814
-1.4	0.05	2	2.13924843    etc....

Great. Exporting geometry is more or less what su2rad is all about. If
that works you can use any common way to run the actual calculations.

The data files have to be in a plain ascii format that can be produced
by rtrace and rcalc. Records are stored in the file one per line. The
lines can be of the format "x y z value" or "x y z dx dy dz value".
You can produce this output with the "-oodv" option for rtrace and a
bit of rcalc:

cat field.fld | rtrace -ab 4 ... -I -oodv scene.oct | rcalc -e
'$1=$1;$2=$2;$3=$3-1;$4=$4;$5=$5;$6=$6*-1;$7=($7*0.265+$8*0.67+$9*0.065)*179
> field.lux

The corrections for $3 and $6 is necessary because rtrace with -I
option reports origin and direction differently.

If you prefer a shorter command line you can calculate only lux (or df
or whatever) values in a separate file and then use rlam to combine
them:

rlam field.fld field.lux > field_import.lux

(that last one is untested).

su2rad doesn't offer an option to run Radiance from within SketchUp
(yet). I do my programming on a Mac so things get developed and tested
on a Unix type system first and then I work on making them work on
Windows. su2rad will also always export data in a format that can be
used with the basic Radiance tools.

Cheers,
Thomas

Gensky only produces the distribution function for the sky but nothing
it is applied to. The "sun" is created as a source but not the sky
dome (see below).

These lines are just comments with useful stuff about the sky. The do
not contribute to the scene.

These two groups define a 'light material' called 'solar' and apply
this material to the geometry type 'source' to produce the 'sun'.

As above this group defines a material that describes the light
distribution over the sky dome. What's missing is a geometry it can be
applied to. I assume you have used gensky on the command line and
saved the output to a file. Add the following lines at the end of the
file:

# basic glow material for sky; brightness is defined by 'skyfunc'
skyfunc glow skyglow
0
0
4 1 1 1 0

# sky dome: 'source' type with skyglow material covering upper hemisphere

# material for ground; use same brightness function but reduced to 10 percent

Subject: [Radiance-general] ranimate Host directive
Message-ID: <4B9CA17D.3020300@curtin.edu.au>

I have been experiencing errors when attempting to use ranimate across 
multple host computers. Specifically if the remote host does not have 
the same user name accounts.

extracted from the .ran file:
host= localhost 1 /export/ranimate/current muser
host= remote1 1 /export/ranimate/current
host= remote2 1 /export/ranimate/current ruser

where muser is the user account name where the ranimate command is 
issued and ruser is the user name on the remote2 computer.

The ranimate man page states:

*host*
    A host to use for command execution. This variable may be assigned a
    host name, followed by an optional number of parallel processes,
    followed by an optional directory (relative to the user's home
    directory on that machine), followed by an alternate user name.
    Multiple /host/ assignments may appear. It is not advisable to
    specify more than one process on a single-CPU host, as this just
    tends to slow things down. The default value is "localhost", which
    starts a single process in the current directory of the local machine. 

clearly it seems that the intended operation is to work from the users 
account

However when the fourth parameter is used eg remote user name, ranimate 
only users this in the ssh command and reverts to the master user name 
in the cd commands (The user name on the master computer that initiated 
the ranimate process). This can be seen in the dump from remote 2 using 
the ps x command:

ruser    4403  1.0  0.1   4712  1700 ?        Ss   15:58   0:00 bash -c 
cd ~muser ; cd /export/ranimate/current ; pfilt -1 -e -2 -x 1854 -y 822 
-pa 1 animat
ruser    4404  3.0  0.0   2052   788 ?        D    15:58   0:00 pfilt -1 
-e -2 -x 1854 -y 822 -pa 1 animation_process_network/frame022.unf


Is this behaviour the intended process or a missing issue in the man pages.

It should also be noted that as soon as a dummy account is made on the 
remote2 computer under the name of muser, everything continues as 
expected (without any changes to the ran file - that is still using the 
ruser parameter)!

Hi Terrance,

This is the as-designed behavior for ranimate.  The basic assumption  
is that you have an NFS-shared filesystem or the like where user names  
are preserved.  Therefore, even if you are logging in as a different  
user on the remote machine, it assumes you want to execute ranimate in  
the originating user's home directory, and you have set up directory  
and file permissions accordingly.  I suppose I should add a check on  
the remote directory, and if a full path is given, forego the cd to  
the originating home directory.

The recommended workaround if this is not the case is to write your  
own remote ssh-replacement and do whatever custom things you want done  
with that, assigning the RSH variable in the .ran file.

-Greg

Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance 4.0 release
Message-ID: <1BA2D45C-215E-4900-B63D-285A412ACDA3@gmail.com>

I just uploaded the official 4.0 release of Radiance, long overdue, to  
the main LBNL website:

	http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/framed.html

I haven't had time to compile binaries for anything but Mac OS X (10.4  
and above), so help with compiles under Linux, Solaris, etc. would be  
welcome.  (Be sure to use static linking if possible.)

The major changes in this version are listed below, with a complete  
list to be found at:

	http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/Notes/ReleaseNotes.html

I will get around to updating the official release on www.radiance-online.org 
  a little later.  As always, the HEAD release with the most recent  
changes and bug fixes will post there.

Enjoy!
-Greg

================
Major updates in 4.0
----------------------------

Added -n option to rvu to provide parallel rendering.

****** COMPATIBILITY CHANGE ********
Changed ".pic" extension to ".hdr" in all sources and documentation
to improve interoperability with other software, since this has become
the de facto extension for Radiance RGBE and XYZE pictures.

Added -N option to objview to support multiprocessing.

Improved sampling of circular sources (source, sphere, ring types) with
quite a bit of help from David Geisler-Moroder.

Added "rpict" and "rvu" variables to rad, and made these as well as
the "oconv", "mkillum" and "pfilt" variables accept an alternate
command path in each case.  Change suggested by Lars Grobe based
on similar Radzilla (radz) facility by Carsten Bauer.

Added gendaylit to distribution (finally).

Created genklemsamp(1) utility to generate samples suitable for
BSDF-based annual calculations.  This is the first Perl script to
be added to Radiance.  Hopefully, others will follow.

Added klems_int.cal file to compute Klems bins for windows.

Created genskyvec  utility to sample a particular sky and
evaluate average radiance over the standard Tregenza sky patches.

Created dctimestep program to compute a set of sensor values or
a combined image for a particular time using the daylight
coefficient method.

Added -n option to rtrace for executing on multiple cores.

Waah! I was hopping that was a exception. How many scripting languages
do we need now to run Radiance?

Anyway, thanks for the upload.

I can't say I enjoy Perl all that much, but at least no one has to  
port the new scripts to Windows...

I'm wishing now I'd picked Python, though I'm not sure what difference  
it makes.

Cheers,

Greg,

I installed your Mac Radiance 4.0 binaries and all is well except when I try to use rvu with X11.
rad foo.rif works fine and produces an hdr image

rad -o x11 foo.rif produced this error
dyld: Library not loaded: usr/X11/lib/libX11.6.dylib
Referenced from: /usr/local/bin/rvu
Reason: image not found

At first, I did not have a /usr/X11 directory, but I do have usr/X11R6
So I copied the contents of X11R6 into a new folder at same level called X11 (don't cringe!) and got this error
dyld: Library not loaded: usr/X11/lib/libX11.6.dylib
Referenced from: /usr/local/bin/rvu
Reason: Incompatible library version: rvu requires version 9.0.0 or later, but libX11.6.dylib provides version 6.2.0

When I copied back all the Radiance 3.9 binaries, I can view in X11 again.
Do I need to update X11 or something?
I'm on a Intel Core2 Duo Mac OS 10.4.11

Thanks
Rob Fitzsimmons

Hi Rob,

You might just try compiling your own binaries from source, and when you get to the part of the makeall script that presents the Rmakefile, and asks you if you want to change it, simply answer yes; you'll be dropped in a vi window where you can change X11 to X11R6. I always had to do that on some Linux boxes I used to admin.

Sorry, I plead ignorance to how X11 gets installed under various  
versions of Mac OS X.  Mine was pre-installed, I think.  There is a  
symbolic link from /usr/lib/X11R6 to X11 (in the same directory) on my  
machine, but I'm not sure how it got there.  There are only dynamic  
versions of the X11 libraries near as I can tell, so static linking  
for the purposes of binary distribution isn't supported.

Rob G's suggestion to recompile yourself is probably best.  Sorry I'm  
not more help.  Anyone else have a solution?

X11 wasn't installed on all versions of Mac OS X, and the procedure  
keeps changing.  You might see if it's an optional item on your OS X  
disk.  But, also, Greg, what version of Mac OS are you using?  If it's  
Leopard (10.5) or Snow Leopard (10.6), it might be that that version  
of the library doesn't exist on Tiger (10.4.)

Yes, I compiled under 10.5 (Leopard) this time.  Perhaps there's a way  
to back-link it to a version that's supported on earlier OS releases?   
(Let's this discussion to the dev list.)

Downloading and unpacking rad4R0all.tar.gz  I see the README says:
    "This is the eighteenth release, Version 4.1,"
and src/rt/VERSION says:
    "RADIANCE 4.1a"

What version is this?  4.0, 4.1 or 4.1a?

Dear users,

 

I produced a couple of hdr images, each from a different light source
(using the radiance module of Relux). I am looking for a way to merge
them and to be able to adjust their intensity. I tried to load them into
Photoshop, but I am not sure how to overlay (lighten?) them, and the
Photoshop layers are not working. 

 

Are there programs where I can easily do that (The one I know  is
Vivaldi from Zumtobel - is that any good?)? If I can do this in
Photoshop, how can I put the images onto different layers to be able to
mix them? How can I produce a little animation of fading in and out of
two images?

 

Thanks for your help

 

Anselm

Hi Anselm.

I don't know if Relux produces plain Radiance RGBE HDR images. If so
you can modify them using the tools provided in the Radiance
distribution. You will have the command line, though.

To mix two (or more) images you can use the program pcomb. You can
specify a multiplier for each image. For example, to mix
"downlight.hdr" with 60% and "wallwash.hdr" at 40% you would use the
command:

pcomb -s 0.6 downlight.hdr -s 0.4 wallwash.hdr > room_6_4.hdr

Using HDR images as input will give you the 'correct' amount of light
in a space. However, if you are only interested in a 'visual' fade
between the two you can simply convert the two images to a 32bit TIF
or BMP image and use the controls you know from Photoshop. I would
think Relux has tools to do that. If not this is the equivalent
Radiance command line:

ra_tiff images.hdr image.tif


Regards,
Thomas

Hi,

on radiance-online.org, the download pages still show 3.9 as latest
release. Is there a way to update the download page?

Cheers, Lars.

Further to this, I was wondering if I could volunteer to update the main
site menu to include info about the 2009 workshop. Christoph and Kera put up
a great page on the Harvard GSD site with all the presentations, but it
would be good to link to it from the side menu on radiance-online.org.

My goof -- it is 4.0, and the rest of the files should be correct.   
This is something I must have messed up in creating this particular  
collection, and I'll fix it along with some other minor things and  
upload later next week.

This is what I get for doing things in a hurry!  Thanks for pointing  
it out.

Thanks for the reminder about the 2009 workshop.  I have been so  
swamped with other things, that I haven't had time for the usual  
website updates.  I'm not really the competent person to do those, but  
I'm the only one at the moment...

I'll also put the 4.0 distribution up on radiance-online, once I get  
the kinks out!

Cheers,

Hi

A possibilty for easy addition and other operations on hdr images is  
HDRShop ... Downloadable in a free 1.0 version from www.hdrshop.com

Rob, did you try starting the X server first by opening 
/Applications/Utilities/X11.app first, then invoking rvu from within an 
xterm window?

Yes, I usually launch X11.app

Is there any harm in having all other binaries as 4.0, but keeping the
rvu 3.9 version?

That's working for me now. Correct me if I'm wrong but rvu is only used
to display in X11 is not used in producing an hdr image.

 

I just signed up for the radiance-dev list if you want to comment over
there

Thanks

 

Rob

Rob, did you try starting the X server first by opening

There should not be a big problem. But you will not be able to use the
new fancy multi-process option. I don't know if rad can pass that on
to a rvu but if it would try at some point you will get an error.

No. rvu is interactively producing the image. To display an image you
would use ximage. Have you tested that yet? Or glrad? I think those
are the only apps that need xlib.

Hi,

You can also try
RadDisplay<http://deluminaelab.com/en/raddisplay_details.html>,
on tab ImagesManipulation you have section Compare Images, where you can
add, substract images and do other manipulations (you can also manually
change pcomb command inside the program to tune results better).

Hope it helps,
Marija

Subject: [Radiance-general] wrong results in Daysim
Message-ID: <75738c941003230710v792c9c3bp4f5bfabcc101cdc4@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all;
I?m been using Daysim for a few weeks now and I?m getting some strange
results that does?t make sence to me. I?m using ecotect from wicht I export
to daysim and when it?s finish I import the results into ecotect again.
I receiveng 0% DA near a window and 100% inside a close space with no
windows. This seems to happen only when I create a grid inside a space with
a lot of internal subdivisions  like walls and pillars. Also seems to happen
only when the grid covers multiple orientations. When is only one (north,
south, etc) this does?n happen either.
Does anyone else experience this using daysim true ecotect????
Anyone knows the problem?

Dear Alejandro,

 

Daysim/Radiance does not distinguish between simple and simple geometries. (Of course, if a sensor is located  in a wall it should yield zero lighting unless your ambient accuracy value is set too high.) My suspicion is that you are reading in a wrong set of sensor points into Ecotect. Ecotect has no intrinsic way of making sure that a DA file actually goes with your current sensor grind. It is up to you to make sure that the two are consistent.

Dear Alejandro,
It has been my experience that when creating interior partitions and pillars in Ecotect the intersecting planes can make some of your outside walls disappear. Making your model incomplete the fact that you are getting 100% in a closed box leads me to believe you are having a modeling issue and not a daysim issue. Check your visualize screen and make sure all your planes  are present

Message-ID: <89355c0f1003231437oe2619dbq190053060fa87140@mail.gmail.com>

Hello.

I have finally managed to modified the falsecolor script to produce
legends with "round" values instead of the default "in between"
values. And while I was at it I also added an option to clip the
magenta background of full colour plots.

The script and example images are here:

http://sites.google.com/site/tbleicher/radiance/falsecolor2

It is still a csh script so it's no use for Windows (although at some
point I considered rewriting the whole thing in Python. I am really
not a csh man ...)

Thomas

I've been thinking about that for a while, too. Maybe, now that you've 
got this far, I'll be persuaded to get off my duff.

Message-ID: <3ccbd68d1003251820s55bfa371k6254b7c016eaba8d@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all:

I have some questions relating to gensky command.

(1) The book of "Rendering with radiance" says luminous efficacy is set to
179 for all CIE sky models. Is that true for current version?

(2) If I know Solar direct radiation and diffuse radiation, I hope to use
Perez's (source: Modeling daylight availability and irradiance components
from direct and global irradiance, 1990 solar energy) models (that is,
interpolate two CIE sky model according to radiation), is that possible to
generate a new sky luminance distribution model by interpolation of two
standard CIE model in Radiance in order to calculate the interior
illuminance more accurately?

Thank you,.

Jia

The 179 lm/watt is the standard luminous efficacy conversion for Radiance, and yes it's still the same for the current version.

If you know direct and diffuse radiation, you can use gendaylit (recently added to the default Radiance distro) to generate a Perez sky model directly. Check the manpage for gendaylit. I have been using it lately for some studies based on TMY weather file info and it works well!

Thank you very much, Rob.

Do you mean I should download the latest version to use that? My OP is
Ubuntu and I am not sure whether the latest one is compatible with this OP.

Hi Jia,

gendaylit was only included in the source distribution for the last couple months (maybe even less than that, the days are blurring together lately). Not sure what you mean by "it" was developed in 1994. Are you using pre-compiled binaries, or some kind of rpm distribution? If so, I doubt you have gendaylit installed, as this was included in the Radiance source distribution only recently. Gendaylit has been around a while, but prior to the new Radiance release, you had to go get it and compile it yourself. If you are compiling from source, then you could grab the latest official release (announced very recently) and compile, and you'd have it. 

At any rate, it's worth seeking it out one way or another because you can use it for precisely what you're talking about.

Hi Rob:

You are right.The lastest version notes it includes the Gendaylit
finally. I can not install Radiance through Makeall because there is an
error indicating that some directory can not be copied (because of existing
file). I followed the instruction at
http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-August/004398.html
to install new Radiance version download from
http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/framed.html. Is that right?

Thanks,

Jia

Message-ID: <92f99fb41003270915p558d05fbj11b53db8248ce5c9@mail.gmail.com>

Hello list,

I would like to simulate LED lights in order to compare them with
fluorescent ones. The simulation process remains the same and i have to
change only the geometry and the data of the light source or something
completely different is required ?

Thank you in advance.

What are you trying to compare? If just the distribution and intensity, and you are looking at an LED luminaire or lamp that has been tested per IES LM-79 and you have a properly formatted (IES LM-63) .ies file as a result, then yes, the process is the same as for fluorescent. Simply create radiance lights with ies2rad for your two (or more) luminaires, and color balance by defining them all as "white" light sources (with the -t option in ies2rad).

Could you be more specific on the error you're getting? Sounds like it's probably a permissions error, but I'm not sure. Are you running the makeall script as root (using the sudo command)?

Not sure what you mean by "it" was developed in 1994. Are you using pre-compiled binaries, or some kind of rpm distribution? If so, I doubt you have gendaylit installed, as this was included in the Radiance source distribution only recently. Gendaylit has been around a while, but prior to the new Radiance release, you had to go get it and compile it yourself. If you are compiling from source, then you could grab the latest official release (announced very recently) and compile, and you'd have it.

Hi Rob,

I see the point, I have to change the light properties. I just found that
companies provide technical data for their LED models.

Thank you for the answer

Hi, I forgot to use sudo command. it is a permission error. It is installed
now by using: sudo ./makeall install. In the end, the Gnome terminal
indicates there are some errors. But it seems that it is running without
problems.

Thank you.

If you did not download and install the "rad3R9supp" package you are
probably missing libtiff and the makeall script complains about errors
related to that. ra_tiff has not been created and other converters
have not been installed to the ../bin directory. Those were the
problems I remember; it's worth checking.

Hi, I am new for ubuntu and confused with different kinds of files for
Radiance. I used the following command to install Radiance, is that right?

navigate to the directory"rad3R9pp"
run:  ./makeall install    (nearly all options in this process are yes
(default). it says there are some error at this step)
Then, ./makeall library

navigate to the directory "ray" (unpack the package downloaded from
http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/framed.html)
run: ./makeall install    (still there are some error)
then, ./makeall library
then, ./makeall clean

Anyone know what is the difference between main distribution (from
http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/framed.html) and "rad3R9all" (from
http://www.radiance-online.org/)?

Thank you,

Jia

Jia.

The current official release is 4.0 from radsite.lbl.gov. This package
contains all files for the core tools. It does not contain source
files for libtiff which is only required if you want to compile the
tool ra_tiff which allows conversion from and to TIF images. However,
there is a small bug in the makeall script: if it can't compile
ra_tiff it will not install any of the other converters. It will
report errors instead.

To avoid these errors you need to download an additional package,
rad3R9supp.tar.gz (or any other archive). This file contains the
libtiff sources and a lot of other material (example scenes, images,
mesh objects). It's a pretty big file and because it's not essential
for the core Radiance tools it was spit out in a separate package.
Don't worry about the version number. The "supp" file should work with
the new 4.0 Radiance from radsite.lbl.gov. All other files on
radiance-online.org need to be updated. The official 4.0 release of
Radiance is only a couple of days old so there was no time yet to
update that site, too.

The best way to compile is:

1) Download and unpack rad4R0all.tar.gz. This will create a "ray" directory
2) Download and unpack rad3R9supp.tar.gz. Unpack this in the same
directory. This will extract its files in the same "ray" directory
that was created before.
3) cd into "ray"
4) compile with "sudo ./makeall install | tee makeall.output"

This will create a file called "makeall.output" with all the stuff
that's scrolling by on your terminal during the process. You can check
it for errors later. If you see the message about errors again send
this file and we can see what was going wrong.

Regards,
Thomas

A small correction to this.  The "rad4R0all.tar.gz" download does  
contain the TIFF library and all the example files and directories.

Best,

Hi Jia,

Your compile results are strange.  It seems like all the binary files  
are being compiled, but the final copy to your executable destination  
is usually skipped.  This may be due to a false error being reported  
by the linker or some other configuration problem.  I would try  
rerunning "makeall install" a second time to see if that doesn't fix  
it.  It shouldn't be necessary, but something is wrong with your build  
system.

-Greg

Hi Greg:

Does these errors affect running Radiance? or do you know if there is any
possible way to check problems of my build system? I once installed Radiance
3.9 using an approach from
http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-August/004398.html
.

Thank you.
Jia

Hi, Greg:
Thank you very much. I will check it to see which is missing.

Just wondering: Does a new Ubuntu system actually have a /usr/local/ directory?

If you don't have that you would get an error at the last "cp ..."
command shown in the output file.

Yes, it has the director. Maybe sudo should be added before cp comannd.

Hi All,

I just wanted to report that Radiance 4.0 compiled with no problems on 
the following Linux variants:

    * Fedora Core 5 - yes an old file server but still running strong
    * Ubuntu 9.10 - the only thing that I had to do was install the
      following packages to get the compile to work smoothly:
          o csh
          o libx11-dev

Thanks, Jack.  Any idea how portable Linux binaries are?  Does it make  
sense to share them with others on the main site?

Hi Greg,

I think they are relatively portable. In our typical environment, I 
normally compile on the old Fedore Core 5 server, but then run on a 
variety of Linux installations with the binaries served via NFS. I would 
be happy to tar the latest compiles and upload them somewhere if that 
would be a help.

-Jack

At the risk of creating some additional confusion, is there some reason 
the usual Ubuntu distribution of Radiance can't be used, and gensky 
added to it?

Hi All,

I have compiled the latest Radiance release (4.0) on Ubuntu 9.10. For 
those who are interested, I have placed a tarball on our ftp site which 
can be downloaded as follows:

   1. go to: ftp.visarc.com
   2. user: u36117396-rad
   3. passwd: rad-r40
   4. get: rad4R0-linux-ubuntu.tgz

This is a temporary location for the short term. I will check in with 
Greg about making this available through www.radiance-online.org.

Please see the README for some basic notes on installation. Note that I 
have also included the documentation directory.

Please let me know if there are any questions and I will answer them as 
I am able.

Regards,

-Jack de Valpine

Uploaded to Debian unstable a few minutes ago. Won't make it into the next
Ubuntu release, though. The current packages is based on the CVS head from this
morning.

Cheers,

You could just create a backport of the official Debian packages. Guess its even
possible to use an Ubuntu PPA for that. If there is enough interest, I would
build the packages, too, but I need to know for which architecture and which
Ubuntu version.


Cheers,

Bernd
