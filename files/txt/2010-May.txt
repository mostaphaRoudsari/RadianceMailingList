Jia.

I don't have any experience with a Revit based process. Below are just
a few general remarks to obj2rad (and CAD import in general).

That is not necessarily a bad thing. The RGB values would almost
certainly be based on screen RGB values which have to be converted for
Radiance. It's better to define a set of materials for Radiance and
assign colors/materials with the same name in your CAD application.
After you have converted the geometry (material data not necessary)
you add your Radiance materials file to the scene and all polygons
will pick up the assigned materials with correct definition.

The idea of the -n option is to give you an understanding of the
objfile structure. You can use the output to define a mapping file
which, for example, assigns a new material to each group in the file.
If there are any useful groups or objects in the file depends on the
way the converter works.

No. The mapping file contains rules that define something along the lines of:

"for any face in the group 'tree' that has the texture 'bark' use the
Radiance material 'brown'"

There is no definition of the material 'brown'. You have to provide
that only when you compile your octree at a later stage.

The above rule in the mapfile would look like:

brown (Group "tree") (Map "bark") ;

You can find out which objects and groups are used in the objfile with
the -n option.

You have to write the map file yourself because it depends on the
definitions in your obj file. If the man page and the above example
are not clear enough you can export the geometry into different obj
files based on their material (all "wall" polygons go in one file, all
"floor" polygons in another). Then you use a single line with the
material name you wish to use for each object. So the mapping file
"floor.map" contains only the line

floor ;

and would be use in the obj2rad command:

obj2rad -m floor.map floor.obj > floor.rad

Radiance does not care about the surface normals. The obj file can
only contain 3- and 4-vertex polygons which Radiance can handle. If
Revit produces surface normals for all polygons and you have only flat
objects you can use the "-f" option of obj2rad to ignore this
information. This will make your *.rad file much smaller.

Caveat: Yesterday I tried to import a *.obj file created by 3D Max.
The file was not a valid file and obj2rad (or rather obj2mesh in my
case) stopped with an error. This is obviously not the fault of
obj2rad but the usability of this work flow depends on the quality of
the *.obj files you can create.

George also has a stand alone application available for download:

http://www.schorsch.com/download/dxf2rad/

I'm not sure about the Linux version with all the glib versions out
there but the Windows version should still run on a typical Windows
machine.

Wow. Easier than obj2rad, eh? Please note that su2rad will also covert
your RGB colors to the Radiance RGB values. You can use your existing
Radiance materials if you want, though.

Thank you very much, Thomas and all the other experts!  Through your
explanation, I am more clear about the usage of this command.

Only one question about the surface normal you mentioned. Genrbox and other
functions have option to determine the surface normal.  For polygon, does
the surface normal affect the materials? i.e. the sequence of vertex in
command Polygon will determine which face has the material.

In .obj file, the face with vertex index 1, 2 and 3 and face with vertex
index 3, 2 and1 should have opposite normals,  So are the materials added to
the two surfaces are different. Is that right? I just copy a simple obj
file to help you understand my problem. It is a wall (10' by 20').

Radiance only uses one material per polygon. Front or back does only
matter if you use a emitting material like 'glow' or 'light' which
only emits to the front side.

The front face of a polygon is defined by the right-hand-rule. But
since front and back material are identical it does not really matter.

That's what I meant about the quality of the *.obj files. You only
need the vertex normals if you want a smoothed surface (for example
for a round column) instead of the faceted polygons. If you can't get
it to work with -f you can just delete all the lines starting with
"vt".

All.

I have updated my Python falsecolor scripts to version 0.2. This
update includes a new stand alone command line executable to replace
falsecolor on Windows.

Download:

You can find download links for the Windows executables and a zip archive here:

http://code.google.com/p/pyrat/downloads/list


A short introduction page is here:

http://sites.google.com/site/tbleicher/radiance/wxfalsecolor


Core Features:

falsecolor2 supports all the features of the original falsecolor. I
have added a few new features and some original features behave a bit
differently:

*) The formatting of the default legend is different.
*) -cb creates a falsecolor image of discreet colours instead of an
obese variation of contour lines.
*) -h shows a summary of the command line options. This option does
not create an image but prints a help message to stdout (terminal).
*) -lp allows you to specify the legend position; legends above and
below the image are horizontal instead of vertical.
*) -mask <minvalue> masks all values below minvalue with the
background color (black).
*) -z creates legends starting at 0

With wxfalsecolor you can

*) load and display Radiance RGBE images
*) display RGB and Lux values (even after conversion to falsecolor image)
*) set falsecolor2 options interactively
*) drag-and-drop images in a desktop environment


Enjoy.

Amazing Thomas! Works out of the box. I have been waiting for a Windows

Hi Andy,

Let me know if I can help. I guess a web based would be the most widely 
accessible. I would certainly be willing to take a look widgets on 
Ubuntu Linux. I would also be happy to help out on a web based version 
as well and provide hosting presuming the hosting environment is suitable.

Best,

I just opened the main.html file of the widget in a few browsers. It
works fine on Safari (OS X) and Chrome (OS X).

Chrome on Windows 7 works but the labels are not visible (might be
related to my vm-ware shared drive). These labels are crated by
javascript which is unfortunately compacted and very hard to modify.
They could easily be made static which would make the widget/html
usable on Windows/Chrome, too.

Firefox shows the sliders as text fields. The sliders (as used) seem
to be a Webkit only feature. It should be easy to translate that to a
cross platform toolkit like jQuery. Dojo is already part of the mix
somehow.

All in all it seems trivial to produce a stand alone javascript
version of this.

Thomas

Hi Thomas,

You're right, it should be trivial.  I tested the html file in safari and firefox over the weekend and came to the same conclusion regarding the sliders.  I used dashcode to create the widget, so next step is to see if one of the other sliders in dashcode is generic javascript and not webkit.

I've also received feedback that it doesn't work in OSX 10.4 which is a bummer, and probably related to the webkit sliders.

I'm not sure what to do about the labels.  dashcode has a nice drag and drop interface builder, and I don't remember there being many options for text but I'll look more closely tonight.  Maybe there is an easy way to make the text static that I missed (like a checkbox or something).  

Unfortunately my ability is currently limited by the capability dashcode (apple's IDE for dashboard widgets).  I'm not the best person to develop a web tool.   If there is someone with javascript and web development experience that is interested in adapting and enhancing the widget to a website I'd actively encourage them to do it.  My plan is continue to develop it as a dashboard widget within dashcode but to remove and avoid webkit specific components (if possible).  Hopefully avoiding webkit will allow it to function in most browsers.

Best,
Andy

The sliders seem to be generic javascript (files are in
/System/Library/WidgetResource/AppleClasses/) but the license limits
them to be used in Dashboard Widgets only. So for a browser/web based
page they have to be replaced.

The labels are no big deal. The static text can be placed in the main
html file. The surrounding DIVs are already there; they are just not
filled in by javascript.

Message-ID: <i2t3ccbd68d1005041903jf67fd22bsad3f767af78947f0@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all:



Thanks to many suggestions and help from this group, I tried some approaches of
importing files to Radiance. I hope to share my experiences and also want to
know if anyone knows how to solve the questions bellow.  First of all, sorry
for such a long email.



To import models to Radiance, there are three basic ways (obj, dxf and
ecotect) (There are others, but I just know the following three):



*(1) **The following uses obj2rad:*

       (a) Convert to *.obj* file by other tools,

   (b) Then use *obj2rad* to convert the *obj* file to .*rad* file;

   (c) Define materials in another .mat file (material names could be found
in the objfile.data by using command: obj2rad -n objfile > objfile.data)



*(**2**)** The following uses dxf2ad*

    (a) In revit, export .dxf file (save as *autocad 2000* rather than
current version),

(b) Then use *dxf2rad* to convert the .dxf file to .rad

But I found all the geometries get the same materials.

So, does anyone know how to handle this problem?



*(3)  The following uses Ecotect *

(a) Export .dxf file from Revit (I can not import dwg by Ecotect, is that
normal?)

(b) In the diag, define different zones *by item name;*

(c) Export the model into .rad file directly, including .mat file

The problem is that .mat file seems not correct. One material is assigned to
one zone. For example, in the Door object, there are two types of materials,
but they are combined into one material after importing to Ecotect.

So does anyone know how to deal with the materials problems?



For the above methods (1) and (2),  the key is to get .obj and .dxf file. To
get .obj file, there are 4 ways;

*(1) In revit, use FBX converter to get obj file*

(a) In revit, export fbx file;

(b) Download FBX converter at URL:
http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/pc/item?siteID=123112&id=10775855

(c) Convert fbx to .obj

The problem is that I always get some zero value of  ?vn? in obj file. Even
if I use ??f? option or delete ?vt? ?vn?, it still does not work because the
?face? in obj file uses ?v/vt/vn? format.  If I delete them, errors appear
because obj2rad can not find ?vt? and ?vn?. Could anyone know how to solve
this problem?



*(2) Use 3D max to get obj file*

   (a) In revit, export fbx file;

   (b) Import fbx file to 3ds max

   (c) Make some changes in 3ds max to get export obj file.

I have not tried this way, but I think this way is better because I can
re-assign or change materials in 3ds max easily and can get the correct
material names. Is this right?



*(3) Using 3ds max to get obj file*

   (a) In revit, export dwg file;

   (b)  Import dwg file to 3ds max;

   (c) Assign materials in 3ds max

  You can see it at  http://www.becausewecan.org/node/190    Should I assign
materials again in 3ds max?   I have not tried this way, but it seems good
as (2).



*(4) using sketchup pro to get obj file. *

**

As always, thank you all.

Jia

The dxf2rad man page says:

"Output primitives will have modifiers based on the layer of each
entity in the form "l_<layer>"."

Basically you have to make sure your DXF has the elements split on
layers based on their material. If Revit uses another convention you
will have to export export elements with different materials
separately.

DXF can only hold information about linetype and linecolor but not
advanced properties like 'material'. Ecotect otoh uses a very
sophisticated material definition to account for all the thermal,
acoustic and reflective properties. In your step (b) above you assign
materials to the layers ("item name") and split them out into zones.
If your door has two materials on the same layer you loose that
information. You can still assign a different material to individual
polygons in one zone, though.

We usually import geometry as 3DS or obj, assign materials in Ecotect
and export to Radiance. Typically we only have 4 or 5 materials so the
problem of defining different materials for a door does not arise.
When we model the geometry in Ecotect we don't even include doors ...

Zeros for vt should not cause problems; it's a perfectly acceptable
value for a texture coordinate. The normal vector should always be
normalized to 1 so (0,0,0) doesn't work. Perhaps you can find a 3D
modeler/converter that can recalculate the normals and produces better
quality *.obj files.

You should be able to replace all normals with a (fake) 0,0,1 value.
If you use the -f option obj2rad should ignore the actual value.

Thomas

If you have access to Rhino you could use that also to open a DWG file and export to OBJ. If the DWG is separated by layers you can assign each layer a material name in Rhino, which will be carried into your OBJ export and kept successfully via obj2rad. Occasionally I?ve seen bad DWG export that when opened in Rhino moves some surfaces out of place.

 

This process usually creates good OBJ/RAD files. The Rhino OBJ export also allows you to select the polygon size/count you require depending on how complex your geometry is.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Laser Cut Panel (LCP) Modelling Problem
Message-ID: <r2u4a3e24cc1005050808mb02fcda3t5510ac9f2dc529d@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I have run into some trouble using the lcp0.cal file that models a Laser Cut
Panel.

The problem I'm seeing is that when I replace my regular window with one
made of the lcp_material direct sunlight seems to eliminated entirely (both
deflected and undeflected) from the interior of my room. My facade is south
facing and is fully glazed with either glass in the 1st case or lcp_material
in the second. The 1st case, with no LCP, shows a diagonal stripe of direct
sun hitting the wall. In the second picture with the lcp_material, instead
of the direct beam being split into deflected and undeflected portions as
expected, the direct beam is completely eliminated.

I have read Phillip Greenup's paper "RADIANCE algorithm to simulate
laser-cut panel light-redirecting elements". I get the feeling that there's
something wrong with my alignments somewhere, but I haven't been able to
find a combination of -rz material rotation, surface normal of the polygon,
and rotation of the room as a whole that produce the correct results.
Everything I've tried results in the same thing: direct beam sunlight
eliminated from the room. One thing I'm not clear on: the -rz rotation in
the prism2 material definition should point the surface normal of the
material in the same direction as the final orientation of the polygon, and
both of those normals should point toward the exterior, correct? I am
defining the room with the +Y wall being the window and then rotating that
room 180 degrees so that it is south facing. As a result, my -rz rotation is
270, to point the normal in -Y. Unfortunately, the results have the same
problem I described whether the -rz rotation is 90, 180, 270,  or 0. I've
included some of the relevant code at the bottom of this email.

I'm hoping this is something that someone else has run into before. I've
been using Radiance for about 8 months, so I've learned some, but definitely
not all, of the ins and outs of the program.

Thanks very much for your help,
Kevin Thuot

I also noticed that your window polygon is oriented towards the exterior of the buillding! You shoud rewrite your polygon this way so that its normal points towards the interior:

One thing I'm not clear on: the -rz rotation in the prism2 material definition should point the surface normal of the material in the same direction as the final orientation of the polygon, and both of those normals should point toward the exterior, correct? I am defining the room with the +Y wall being the window and then rotating that room 180 degrees so that it is south facing. As a result, my -rz rotation is 270, to point the normal in -Y. Unfortunately, the results have the same problem I described whether the -rz rotation is 90, 180, 270,  or 0. I've included some of the relevant code at the bottom of this email.

I'm hoping this is something that someone else has run into before. I've been using Radiance for about 8 months, so I've learned some, but definitely not all, of the ins and outs of the program.

Thanks very much for your help,
Kevin Thuot

Hi Jia,

Here are a few additional pointers on obj from revit.

NORMALS
For whatever reason it seems that fbx converted to obj using the FBX 
converter can for some normals report:

    vn 0 0 0

which make obj2rad unhappy.

So the best thing that I have found is generally to take the convert 
fbx->obj file and process it through something like Rhino, Polytrans, 
NuGraf, or Blender (other suggestions out there...). Which have 
functionality to recalculate normals and otherwise process meshes/polygons.

MATERIALS
First off as I believe some others have pointed. Material information 
from other programs is useless! They do not report valid reflectance 
information. The only thing that you should hope to get is that the 
geometry is organized by material name.

A stock conversion from fbx->obj will for what ever reason organize 
geometry by object name! This is despite the fact that there is a valid 
usemtl statement in the obj file. This can be ok however it does mean 
that you probably need to have some kind of parser to do some material 
mapping in a useful way (there can be hundreds of object names). I did 
this in perl early on in my experience processing Revit models into 
something useable by Radiance. However, this all can be better managed  
by processing the fbx->obj file through Rhino, Polytrans, NuGraf or 
Blender where you can process the file and send out an obj with normals 
and material groupings that make you and Radiance happy.

Best,

-Jack

Hi Jia,

I think that in Rhino the thing to use is the "repair mesh" tool. And 
then when you "save as" you should select the check box to export 
material names.

Hi Andy, this is great!  Looking forward to the iPhone app.....

I'm curious how / where you and others are obtaining / calculating the  
input values for Trans, specifically for the transmitted specular  
component?  I've often found this (Tspec) a tough value to get or  
derive at as it's not measured for the LBNL, IDGB data base, nor by  
most glass and film manufactures.

Cheers,
Chris

Hello:

I download the evaluation version of Rhino V 4.0 SR 8 (about 120 M, the
latest evaluation version with full funcations) from its official
website. It has a limitation of 25 times of saving files.

 I can import dwg (2007) from revit 2010 and export obj by Layer.Another way
I tried was to import fbx which was exported from Revit 2010. I intend to
export obj file through "export material definition". But the command line
of Rhino says Error importing XXX.fbx.

I asked this question in Autodesk Discussion Group and they say "FBX from
Revit 2010 is only compatible with Max 2010. It doesn't work like
earlier versions of FBX where other programs could open it."  So the problem
is that current Revit uses a new version of fbx while Rhino seems to use an
old one.

Regards,
Jia

Sounds familiar to anyone who has been using Autodesk-products before. 
Once you save your data in one of their formats, it is basically gone - 
formats are changing with every release and are hardly documented anywhere.

Still as another hint, there are two attempts to get access to at least 
some data in dwg files. One is still in development:

http://www.gnu.org/software/libredwg/

They have not published their recent updates to the code, but aim at 
some rather ambitious parsing library for dwg.

The other attempt is support for 3d-dxf in Blender:

http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Extensions:2.4/Py/Scripts/Import/DXF-3D

The idea here is to ignore dwg (which is changing too often and has 
terrible documentation if any) and instead rely on dxf. They recommend 
the use of another external tool to convert from dwg to dxf in case it 
is required, which works perfectly fine also using wine on Linux.

Still, as a note from my side: if Revit does not support any export out 
of Autodesk formats at all, and the application is generating models for 
simulation - may be Revit is just the wrong software for this? There is 
a lot of great, relieable modeling software out there developed by 
companies playing fair and not locking users away from their own data... 
I cannot imagine to spend money on a modeler that does not support any 
standard format (e.g. step or iges would be a must and would already 
solve your problems).

Cheers, Lars.

Is there any reason not to use the dwg as exported from Revit? In the
rhino layer manager, there is a column for material. If you enter a name
for the material of each layer (no need to specify color here), that
will carry over to the obj export if you check the box to export with
material definitions.

 

If fbx was able to work would this maintain material names assigned in
Revit?

Dear All,

I am trying to programmatically convert a number of radiance images into
their falsecolor equivalent. As the images display a wide range of
possible values I am trying to figure out a method for automatically
adjust the scale.

The manual page of falsecolor reads: "If the argument given to -s begins
with an "a" for "auto," then the maximum is used for scaling the
result." Which is exactly what I need, unfortunately it does not work
for me: no error is thrown but the scale is always the standard 0 to
1000.

This is the syntax that I am using:

" Falsecolor -ip mypic.hdr -s a -n 10 -l Lux > mypic_fc.hdr "

I am using Radiance 3.9 on Windows, which might be the reason.

I have also tried this on the real useful falsecolor2 by Thomas Bleicher
(thanks!!) and in this case I receive the error 'bad option'.

Does anyone have any suggestion/clue?

Thanks in advance,
Best,

Giovanni

Hi Jia and Lars,

A few thoughts here.

FBX
I think that if you are going to use fbx in your workflow from Revit, 
unless you are using Max, you will need to use the FBX Converter, to 
process the fbx to some other format, such as obj. Note though that the 
FBX Converter does enable you to process fbx to older versions of the 
fbx format. Perhaps with some experimentation you can determine which of 
these might work with Rhino's fbx import capability.

DWG
The problem that I have noticed with dwg exported from Revit is that the 
layer organization is vastly simplified, so that while the geometry will 
all be there, it may not be broken out by layer the way you want and 
trying to reorganize the geometry in Autocad is probably impractical. 
FBX on the other hand does maintain correct material associations with 
the type of work flow that I have outlined previously. NOTE however that 
for some simulation purposes a model in dwg format and layering may be 
perfectly sufficient!

REVIT
I think it is pretty obvious that Autodesk would like to achieve some 
level of vendor lock-in across their product family (I think that for 
the most part they have been successful in this regard looking at their 
acquisitions and product offerings). Thus, all the pains (over the many 
years) that we have had to deal with in trying to get usable geometry 
out of applications such as Autocad and now Revit. I agree that there 
are other good solutions for modeling that are probably more open in 
terms of their import/export formats and other functionality. However, 
my observation is that more and more architectural design firms are 
moving towards Revit which I have to say actually produces models that 
are reliable and reasonably well organized, to the extent that I feel 
that we can actually make use of client produced models. I think that it 
make a lot of sense to figure out how to leverage this model data from 
Revit for simulation purposes, to do otherwise is impractical and 
missing how the architectural design process/industry is evolving.

Giovanni.

The "-s auto" option uses phisto and sed to work out the maximum scale
from the image. One or both may not be available on your system. BTW:
Where does the falsecolor binary come from? The 3.9 MinGW bundle does
not have it, iirc. Perhaps that feature is not implemented at all.

As for falsecolor2 I just haven't implemented the "auto" option.

If you can script a bit you can try to find the max value with
pextreme and calculate a maximum scale from that.

Regards,
Thomas

Hi,


For one or multiple false color images generation you can use
RadDisplay<http://deluminaelab.com/en/raddisplay_details.html>.

You have an option for palette type "Image based proportional", and it makes
palette according to values in the image, You can change number of colors,
and also start and end color for the palette.

There is an option to make multiple FC images at once using common color
palette and scale.
On images manipulatio tab you have a section "Create false color images",
and there you can define multiple images and create for the same palette FC
images.

Note that scale and colors palette is made littlebit different then in
Radiance (but still based on colors in original False color program).

If you have futher questions on this topic, you can contact me here on list
or on private mail.

Regards,
Marija

Thomas,

Thanks for the quick reply, 
I thought about the possibility of using pextreme, although I was really
hoping somebody had that already worked that out for me! ;) Moreover the
solution implemented by Greg with -s auto is so much more elegant than
what I could do with pextreme! 

Thanks anyway and thanks for falsecolor2 and wxfalsecolor, they are
really nice and useful tools!

Best,

G

If it can wait a day I can add a "-s auto" option with pextrem to
falsecolor2. I can't build a binary until this evening so if you
really need it this afternoon you have to install Python (if you can).

I guess an option like that would be rally useful,

I am controlling radiance through batch files written in ecotect
scripting (maybe not the most straightforward way of doing it but it
serves the purpose).I have no knowledge of python but I guess I can try
to make something with pextreme. 
Anyway it would be nice to have such an option directly in falsecolor2
and I can wait until tomorrow ;)

Thanks again,

G

If it can wait a day I can add a "-s auto" option with pextrem to
falsecolor2. I can't build a binary until this evening so if you
really need it this afternoon you have to install Python (if you can).

It's your lucky day! It turns out that I have all my packaging
requirements here on my work PC. I have added a "-s auto" option and
tested it a tiny bit. You have to do the rest.

I couldn't send you the file via PM so I have uploaded a zip with the
binary here:

https://sites.google.com/site/tbleicher/radiance/wxfalsecolor/falsecolor2.zip?attredirects=0&d=1

If the link doesn't work go the attachments at the bottom of the page.

To the rest of you out there: I really haven't done much testing. Use
at your own risk. There will be another release of
wxfalsecolor/falsecolor2 soon which will include this feature (and
more).

Hi Chris,

This depends on the level of accuracy you need...

For blinds, in the past I've made a crude approximation using manufacturer's reported normal incidence data: http://www.hexcelscreen.com/xlscreen/index.htm
Ts = openfactor
Td = Tv - openfactor

However I've since learned that the typical measuring process does not measure the hemispherical transmission (the light exiting in all directions) but just the light exiting in the specular direction.  So light transmission is under represented, especially for lighter colored fabrics.

Way back when Rob G. had a measurement procedure to measure exiting light at many angles for diffuse glazing samples.   Greg provided a method for fitting trans to the measured data:
http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-January/001415.html

If you want the manufacturer to provide test data there is a european standard that describes a blind measurement procedure for hemispherical transmission.  I don't know the standard number, but perhaps someone else on the list knows what it is?  This procedure only measures values for normal incidence though.

For the most accurate result at all incident angles you may need to abandon trans for mkillum with the new BSDF feature. 

Hope that helps.
Andy

You would probably end up doing a full measurement of the bidirectional 
reflection / transmission distribution. Then you could use the data to 
e.g. fit a trans material to it. The normal incidence alone is not 
really suitable to reflect the incident distribution for a window...

Cheers, Lars.

Hello:

Thanks for your advice. I almost forgot FBX Converter because I used it to
convert the FBX to OBJ and always get "vn" 0 0 0.  I try that again, and
find if I convert FBX to 3DS and then import 3DS to Rhino, it works at my
first glance! and also contains correct material names  though in one layer.


Revit could directly export DXF (2007) and DWG (2007) by layers (the
materials seem missing), which can be imported to Rhino to get OBJ.
As Christopher and Jack said, it was required to reorganize layers (e.g, in
revit) before DXF/DWG (is any difference for the two?) is exported.  I will
also take a look at other ways Lars said.

 The layers for DWG/DXF format in Revit are organized according to its
categories and family types. I tried to customize and reorganized
some layers based on the default layer organization and it may
be acceptable for not complicated geometry.

Thank you all.
Jia

Hi Jia

Not sure why you want to go fbx to 3ds with the converter. 3ds is an old 
format that has limitations to geometry that may impact your model. You 
should be able to go to obj and then import the obj into Rhino to do 
what you want (such as fix normals and export a "good" obj). For obj2rad 
you want the object to have material names assigned.

Layers and materials are distinct methods of organization. If you are 
working with Autocad and going to Radiance, layers are the principal 
method of organizing your geometry. If you are working with Revit, 
materials are the principal method of organizing geometry (unless you 
want to work on a per object basis).

If I recall correctly, it has been awhile, if you export from revit to 
dwg, then certain family categories will get compressed onto one 
representative layer. Depending on what you are doing this may loose 
critical geometry differentiation that you need to have. And it is a 
really big pain to try to edit the resulting autocad model to recover 
such differentiation.

Hello Jack:

You are right, I should convert fbx to obj. I am not very familar with
different types of formats.  In revit, some families categories are combined
into one layer. My way is to re-define them by myself and in this case I can
get different layers with different materials.

Thank you,
Jia

It is a very good way by converting FBX to obj via FBX converter and then
using Rhino to import obj. It contains all material information and can be
used by obj2rad.

Thank you!
Jia

Hi Jia,

You should not have to worry about layer conversion/mapping in revit if 
you are going fbx->obj. However, your families will need to have useful 
materials assigned, where useful is defined as a unique name rather than 
a <by category>, does that make sense?

When you "save as" obj from Rhino there is a checkbox for materials that 
you should check.

Hi Jia,

Thanks! I have to admit it took some trial and error to get it figured

Hi Jack:

In Rhino, I use "Rebuild mesh normal" tool to make zero "vn" disappear. Is
that right?

Thanks,

Hi All

 

I'm doing a glare analysis using Radiance in IES Virtual Environments.

 

For some reason, the components in the room sometimes don't show up and
I get the following error:

This error came up after I changed the sky file, but it happened quite
randomly before, so I'm not sure whether this has anything to do with
it. Sometimes the same simulation worked fine when I ran it on a
different PC. However, the problem seems to spread.

 

Did this happen to anyone before? Can anyone point to what am I doing
wrong?

Hm, it looks like you have a modified version of oconv, never seen the 
time output for it before. I also do not know xform2. However the 
message is clear - the files are not found. Either this is a mistake by 
xform2 or by the tool that was supposed to generate these files. So the 
first thing to do is to check whether the listed files are at the given 
locations. I guess the weird directory name have to do with some windows 
file-system limitations? What surprises me is that xform2 uses 
backslashes for directories - is this the modification against xform 
that led to the name change?

If it happened randomly before there seam to be other reasons.

So as mentioned before, it seams that the commands involved are not 
really part of radiance but some derived, modified binaries. Start 
debugging by finding out whether the error messages correctly detect 
these missing files. Then one could start to find out how this IES 
Virtual Environment works and creates / names / writes the files. In 
radiance, one would also typically have a variable RAYPATH set including 
all file system paths where scene files are to be found.

Lars.

Message-ID: <AANLkTil8SpcRVzVMsPz_tYNibRE7alF8bvviLhoR5o9q@mail.gmail.com>

All.

I have updated wxfalsecolor and falsecolor2 over the weekend.

As usual, executables for Windows and source package can be found here:

    http://pyrat.googlecode.com/files/wxfalsecolor_v0.3.zip

Documentation is here (bottom of page):

    http://sites.google.com/site/tbleicher/radiance/wxfalsecolor


Short feature summary:

falsecolor2:

* The formatting of the default legend is different.
* -cb creates a falsecolor image of discreet colours instead of an
obese variation of contour lines.
* -h shows a summary of the command line options. This option does not
create an image but prints a help message to stdout (terminal).
* -lp allows you to specify the legend position; legends above and
below the image are horizontal instead of vertical.
* -mask <minvalue> masks all values below minvalue with the background
color (black).
* -z creates legends starting at 0
* -s auto option for automatic legend scale adjustment (new)

wxfalsecolor:

* load and display Radiance RGBE images
* display RGB and Lux values (even after conversion to falsecolor image)
* set falsecolor2 options interactively
* drag-and-drop images in a desktop environment
* set pcond options interactively (new)
* display labels for spot and average pixel values (like ximage; new)
* save image as bitmap (improved)
* view image headers (new)


Enjoy,
Thomas

Chris,

Xform2 is an additional program that IES created.  Similar to xform,  
IES uses xform2 to create rectangles of arbitrary dimension for, it  
seems, use as workplanes (and perhaps other functions).  It does this  
by applying arbitrary scaling in the x and y dimensions  
(independently) on a unit square polygon (z = 0.8) and translating the  
output to the desired location in the scene.  In addition to the usual  
xform options, xform2 has -sx and -sy to perform the scaling in the x  
& y dims.

I came across this IES peculiarity when transferring IES created  
geometry to other platforms for simulation using standard (UNIX)  
Radiance.  In those instances it was simply a matter of stripping out  
the xform2 commands, which didn't affect the building geometry since  
their use was confined to generating workplanes.  However, from the  
error messages that you posted it seems that xform2 is being used for  
more general transformations where xform would suffice.  Perhaps IES  
have replaced xform with their own xform2. As an aside, I'm surprised  
to see any form of xform/2 command used for general building geometry  
created in IES because I expected its 3D modeller to create explicit  
geometry (for all but the workplanes).

	heading?
Message-ID: <D537B22C-55D6-4085-A0F9-769067408D97@dmu.ac.uk>

Fellows,

The intention here is to try to envisage what the software landscape  
might be like in five / ten years time, at least for Radiance users  
doing climate-based (i.e. annual) daylight modelling, perhaps  
including complex glazing systems.

Jan Wienold mentioned a while back that a photon-mapping Radiance add- 
on (I assume pmap) is in the works, and that it would be integrated  
with DAYSIM for annual simulations. Greg Ward has recently  
demonstrated the rtcontrib-BSDF approach that seems to offer similar  
functionality.

So, are we being presented with a fork in the road ahead?  If so, how  
will we decide which path to take?  Is now perhaps the right time to  
consider working-up a checklist of capabilities/strengths/weaknesses  
for the two approaches?

I don't believe that we are too far away from seeing metrics founded  
on climate-based daylight modelling appearing in guidelines such as  
LEED etc.  In which case, there could be something of a scramble as  
potentially many, many new Radiance users join what is still a fairly  
small bunch of 'enthusiasts' doing annual simulations.  It think it  
would be useful to get this discussion on the go sooner rather than  
later.

Best,

-John

Sounds like a great idea, John.  I see it as a (very) friendly  
competition, where two groups are trying to solve a similar set of  
problems with slightly different approaches.  I can probably come up  
with a set of goals and known limitations for the rtcontrib approach  
as a starting point.  The photon map has been around long enough and  
has been used by a sufficient number of people that I hope we can  
solicit reviews from users as well as the creators (Roland and Jan).

Cheers,
-Greg

Thanks John and Lars

I tried a few things based on your comments, e.g. calling up xform
instead of xform2, making sure that the location input is ok, but
unfortunately without success.

The problem really seems to be specific to certain computers. One file
which ran fine yesterday on my colleagues computer, didn't work on mine
when I tried to run it just afterwards.

Could it be that there is something in e.g. my windows registry that
causes this issue? The batch files created by VE include the following
line before they run the radiance programs:

SET PATH=C:\Windows;C:\Windows\system32;C:\Program Files\IES\VE
6\apps\ray

Message-ID: <FA7EAE3B-6BE9-4955-8952-2156982DDF5F@dmu.ac.uk>

Another peculiarity of IES, at least the Radiance part, is that it  
doesn't like to work from anything other than the system disk, i.e.  
trying to work from a project saved on USB stick/drive nearly always  
leads to problems (I imagine it's the same for FW drives). You're  
advised to save a project as a CAB file and copy that if you want to  
transfer a project between computers. Probably best to ensure also  
that the various PCs are running the same version of IES.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Upgrading to R4: "There were some errors."
Message-ID: <645889300.741273589319356.JavaMail.root@scalix.transgmbh.local>

Hi All,

I just attempted to upgrade my existing R3.9 installation on Ubuntu 9.10 to R4. I did:
sudo ./makeall install clean per the readme file (actually the readme doesn't mention sudo but a couple steps in i realized i needed it). Lots of scary things flashed by, and i caught various warnings going by. It then stopped with "There were some errors." So I tried an rtrace job that I know runs on 3.9, and it still runs. But when I add the -n option (-n 2 or -n 4, for example), it crashes with a fatal error: command line error at -n. (It's a four core machine with 4gb ram)

To the extent that it remained on the screen, the output from my installation follows. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks,
Cramer

Cramer,

It appears that your system's X11 header files are not in 
/usr/include/X11. Every error in the output is because the 
installer is looking in /usr/include/X11 for header files. The 
warnings are all ignorable. And rtrace is still running the old 
version, which doesn't have the "-n" option.

Do an "ls /usr/include/X11" and see if that directory contains 
files like "Xutil.h" and "Xlib.h". If not, see if 
/usr/include/X11R6, or some other directory like that contains 
them. Once you've found them, when you run the makeall script, 
choose to edit the makefile. Change the "-I/usr/include/X11" to 
reflect the header files actual location.

I hope this helps.

Mark

PS. I use Fedora (10 now) and things work.

Lots of scary things flashed by, and i caught various warnings going by. It then stopped with "There were some errors." So I tried an rtrace job that I know runs on 3.9, and it still runs. But when I add the -n option (-n 2 or -n 4, for example), it crashes with a fatal error: command line error at -n. (It's a four core machine with 4gb ram)

Hi there.

One thing I could see in this shortened output:

rhd_x11.c:11:23: error: X11/Xlib.h: No such file or directory
rhd_x11.c:12:29: error: X11/cursorfont.h: No such file or directory
rhd_x11.c:13:24: error: X11/Xutil.h: No such file or directory

You don't have the X11 development package installed. Search for a
package like "X11-dev" or similar and install that.

You should probably do a
sudo ./makeall clean
sudo ./makeall install

After that you can add another "makeall clean" to remove files from
the process. Unfortunately the makefile doesn't have a 'build' target,
so you could restrict the sudo to just the installation step.

Use the following to capture the output into a file:

sudo ./makeall install | tee build.log

That will copy all the output to "build.log" and you can inspect it
later in detail.

Have you checked that you are actually running the new 4.0 version?

rtrace -version

Hi,

I think that for a stock install of Ubuntu you need to install a few 
additional packages (using synaptics makes this pretty easy), off the 
top of my head you will likely need the following:

    * x11 development libs
    * csh

Not sure what else off hand. Note however (a quick search of the list 
might have come up with this...), that I actually have provided Radiance 
4.0 binaries compiled on Ubuntu 9.10. These are available as follows:

Lots of scary things flashed by, and i caught various warnings going by. It then stopped with "There were some errors." So I tried an rtrace job that I know runs on 3.9, and it still runs. But when I add the -n option (-n 2 or -n 4, for example), it crashes with a fatal error: command line error at -n. (It's a four core machine with 4gb ram)

As several people mentioned, you're missing some build-dependencies.
Running
apt-get build-dep radiance
should install them for you.

Or just install radiance from the packages which are distributed with Ubuntu:
apt-get install radiance
Also you might want to look at the descriptions of radiance-sse3, radiance-doc,
radiance-materials.
Ubuntu 9.10 should ship with radiance 3R9, Ubuntu 10.04 with 4R0.

Cheers,

Bernd

Mark, Jack, & Thomas,

Thanks for the tips! I tried adding the libx11-dev and csh packages, but 
it still didn't work. So I (gave up and) grabbed Jack's compiled version 
from his ftp site, copied the files to the right places, and it now 
reports 4.0 as the version for rtrace and rvu.

I'm hung up a new error though, rtrace reports that it can't find 
"inglas.cal". Does that sound familiar to anyone? It could be a file one 
of my german colleagues made that I lost in the process, but 
unfortunately they've all gone home for the day already...

Thanks again,
Cramer

one more thing about this missing "inglas.cal" file: if i take the -n 4 
option out of my rtrace call, it runs fine (on one core).

Hi Cramer,

This must be a special cal file that your firm has developed. For any 
custom cal files that we develop I place them in a separate library 
(separate from the radiance standard lib), this way we know what we have 
developed. If your firm has used a similar model for any custom files 
then you may just need to find out "where" they are on your 3.9 
installation and make sure that RAYPATH is also pointing to your custom 
library location.

It is a bit puzzling that removing the -n 4 switch makes the rtrace run 
work...

I'm puzzled by this as well.  The use of the new "-n" option for  
rtrace shouldn't affect whether it can find .cal files or not.  I  
suspect that something else changed between tests, such as the setting  
of the RAYPATH environment variable.

Subject: [Radiance-general] rcalc if, else, then
Message-ID: <7E9191C753C6724DB772B5610559B2CF023056E31C@winxbeuk01.exchange.xchg>

HI Group,

This is bugging me and possibly easy to resolve but I'm struggling.  I am testing materials and their reflectance and need to use rcalc to help me identify which materials my ray is hitting.

Using a simple mirror material I have created a blue material with close to 0 red and green.  I have fired a ray in the direction of this material and now I need to determine whether it is a hit.  Using -ab 0 I get the following result:

5.475634e+01	5.475634e+01	2.737817e+02

My material is below:

void mirror wall
0
0
3 	0.2 0.2 1

I'd like to use rcalc to tell me whether I am hitting the material or not.  I was thinking of something like 

rcalc -e 'if($1=$3,$1=1,$1=0)' test.dat > test_res.dat  simply to give me a Boolean dat file of either 1 or 0.

But obviously that doesn't work so can someone help me with a possible solution?  I've trawled the mailing list to no avail so far.

Many Thanks

Dan

Hi Dan,

I don't know why you wouldn't use the rtrace -om option, but doing it  
your way, you just need the right syntax:

	rcalc -e '$1=if($3-2*$1-2*$2,1,0)' test.dat > test_res.dat

I chose these factors based on your material that reflects 5x as much  
blue as red and green.  The above should work for white illumination  
and assuming you don't have other blue materials in your scene.

Best,
-Greg

Hi Greg,

I'm also eventually testing the direct solar reflectance from my trace point so I felt that the rcalc method would answer both questions.  It would probably have made it more clear if I explained that originally.  Thanks for the quick response, it works like a charm.

Cheers

Ouch, just had to realize that it does not.

Here are short instructions to build the packages:

sudo apt-get install fakeroot devscripts
sudo apt-get build-dep radiance
dget -xu \
 ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/r/radiance/radiance_4R0+20100331-1.dsc
cd radiance-4R0+20100331
dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot
cd ..
sudo dpkg -i radiance*.deb

I could provide packages for lucid if there is some interest, just let me know
for which architecture please.

Greg & All,

echo $RAYPATH currently yields nothing, so maybe that's the problem (but 
PATH does include usr/local/bin). My problem is, i'm not really a linux 
guy, and googling how to set it returns no fewer than a gazillion 
different places that PATHs are set. Can you tell me where the best 
place would be, and what exactly the line is (in Ubuntu 9.10)? Sorry, I 
know it's a newbie question, but there doesn't seem to consensus on the 
internet (not that there ever really is) on how to do this.

Bernd, adding the build-dep packages didn't solve the compiling problem. 
If the setting raypath doesn't fix it, I'm starting with a fresh install 
of the OS with all packages selected. Radiance is the only thing I use 
this machine for, so it's not really a big deal.

Thanks,
Cramer

Hi Cramer,

installing the complete operating system is certainly not required. Did 
you (exactly) follow Bernd's instructions, not only adding the packages? 
What the procedure he described does is actually building Radiance on 
your system, but not by simply copying the binaries to /usr/local, but 
by integrating them into your system using the package manager whenever 
it is possible. Just follow his steps one by one.

I would strongly advice users to go this way - the generic 
/usr/local-approach leads to a lot of confusion with people ending up 
with a mess of files in that directory. This makes debugging difficult 
and successful updates become challenging. Nothing to say against it as 
long as one really keeps track and can do a rm -R /usr/local from time 
to time - but impossible to maintain for a casual user.

Cheers,

Lars.

This is required ONLY for those not using an installer or package 
manager. Typically these are developers or advanced Radiance users who 
do not need this advice. I however add this to complete the thread on 
installing Radiance.

The RAYPATH variable contains directories that are searched by Radiance 
at runtime for all scene-related files. This can be geometry, octrees, 
procedural cal-files, textures,... It is NOT used to search for binaries 
- the system's standard PATH variable is used for that.

1) To do anything useful with Radiance, one should have the directory 
containing the cal-files coming with Radiance included in RAYPATH. This 
is the lib-directory in the installation target - the default makeall 
script would probably use /usr/local/ray/lib (you are asked for the 
library location when running makeall). So this is the first.

2) Many of us will maintain their own library for textures, cal-files, 
octrees to be used as instances. This one should be the second directory 
included, say, /usr/share/radiance/objlib

3) There may be a directory containing a similar library, but only for 
use with one project. This may be a subdirectory of the project, say, 
/home/cramer/project/theater1/lib

4) Many of us like to have the current directory in their RAYPATH as a 
default. May lead to messing up the system, but is comfortable while 
developing e.g. a cal-file that is not ready to go into the library yet.

So - the RAYPATH should always include 1, 2, and 4, but 3 on a 
per-project base. If you are using the Bash as a shell (probably you do 
on Linux), add the RAYPATH to your Bash-configuration in your home 
directory:
--
cd
gedit ,bashrc
--
(if you do not want the Gnome-GUI use nano instead of gedit) and add the 
following line to the end
--
export RAYPATH=$RAYPATH:/usr/local/ray/lib:/usr/share/radiance/objlib:.
--
This APPENDS the directories to the RAYPATH instead of overwriting it.

For point 3, you can just include it before starting a simulation by typing
--
export RAYPATH=$RAYPATH:/home/cramer/project/theater1/lib
--
at the command line before starting a simulation, or you add it to the 
beginning of a small script that you may use for calling the necessary 
commands for your simulation.

I hope this helps. It should at least explain why you found many 
different RAYPATH-setting in the archives - it really depends on where 
people keep their stuff.

Cheers,

Lars.

Sorry, a typo here, of course the settings are in the file .bashrc ...

And, to take effect, you must reload the configuration. Either close

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.1005131434260.30830@goldenaxe.gpcc.itd.umich.edu>

I am using a Radiance mesh primitive, converted using obj2mesh, 
which contains texture coordinates. I want to use those texture 
coordinates to set the grey reflectance of the mesh. But when I 
rvu the model, I get:

rvu: Ly`grey: undefined variable

My .obj file looks like:

vt 0 0.136413
v -1.86092 -2.25017 -0.364442
v -1.8692 -2.23265 -0.387964
v -1.8692 -2.22994 -0.385942
v -1.86092 -2.24745 -0.36242
v -1.87395 -2.25237 -0.361491
v -1.88223 -2.23485 -0.385014
v -1.88223 -2.23214 -0.382992
v -1.87395 -2.24965 -0.359469
f 1/1 2/1 3/1
f 1/1 3/1 4/1
f 4/1 3/1 7/1
...

My scene.rad file is:

void brightfunc basecolor 2 refl grey.cal 0 0
basecolor plastic def 0 0 5 1.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 0.0
def mesh amesh 1 scene.msh 0 0

And grey.cal is simply:

refl = Ly;

What am I doing wrong?

Hey Mark,

Do you mean to use Lu instead of Lv? The texture coordinates for a mesh 
object are Lu,Lv.

Gah! It was that simple. At least I spent some time re-reading 
the ray.pdf manual and browsing rayinit.cal for new stuff.

Hi,

On Ubuntu 9.10, if bash is your shell (check with the following):

    printenv | grep SHELL

then, you can edit .profile (ls -lf to see the . files) to include 
something like the following (at the end of the file should be fine):

    RAYPATH=.:/usr/local/lib/ray
    export RAYPATH

then to set this for the current login session:

    source .profile

future logins should be fine.

To check if RAYPATH is set and what to:

    printenv | grep RAYPATH

Hello all again. I have ran into a slight problem when rendering fish eyes
with multiple processors.
If you look at the linked image you can see that some of the frames are
misplaced, incomplete and/or dropped. It is almost always along or near the
edges of the renderings. It is frustrating as non-fisheye images render fine
95% of the time.

Subject: [Radiance-general] "Dynamic Radiance" and Radiance Terminology
Message-ID: <FFF56A6D37A3A54F91A03601AC22DA320C46211B22@MAILBOX2.nrel.gov>

Greetings, all.

Following an entire week in Las Vegas for Lightfair 2010, I am delighted to be home, with wallet and liver both beat up a little bit, but largely intact, and not hooked up to any machines or the like. The end of the week, as many of you know, featured a new Daylight Symposium organized by Lisa Heshong (which was an amazing and heroic event). That I was invited to attend this event, to be a part of the discussion that included many of the best and brightest minds in daylighting, was an honor -- and that is why I write this message with some trepidation, because I hope to not ruffle any feathers here. But I believe that the creation and subsequent misuse of the term ?Dynamic Radiance? is leading us toward a blurred distinction between the tools and the techniques of climate-based daylight modeling (CBDM), and that this should be addressed.

As many of us know (and as John Mardaljevic pointed out the other week on radiance-online.org), daylight simulation is at an evolutionary crossroads. Core components of the Radiance toolkit have once again evolved, this time to support climate based daylight modeling (CBDM) in an efficient manner. The resultant new Radiance programs are largely the result of a support effort for the work being done by Lisa Heshong and Heshong Mahone Group in support of the IESNA?s Daylight Metrics Sub-Committee, and this work is being reported on a fair amount these days as the all the pieces of that important research come together. As a result, these new tools that were added to the Radiance toolbox, starting with rtcontrib and ending with all the recent tools developed to make rtcontrib usable by mortals (genklemsamp, dctimestep et al.), ended up getting a generic catch-all phrase for ease of use in discussion and in PowerPoint slides: ?Dynamic Radiance?.

With all due respect to Lisa Heshong, I respectfully submit my opposition to the use of this name for these new tools and processes. I understand the need to wrap the new developments into something linguistically tangible; Lisa was one of the first people to have to refer to these new tools in a meaningful way in papers and presentations (and I saw many over the last week and previously). But I would argue that the core tools rtcontrib, genklemsamp and dctimestep are merely the latest additions to that wonderful collection of programs (rpict, rtrace, and over seventy others) which already exists, and for the past two decades has been collectively called, cited, and referenced as, Radiance. 

Many times over the course of the Daylight Symposium I heard phrases like ?the ?new version? of Radiance?, or ??used ?Dynamic Radiance? to calculate??. Maybe I?m being a semantics wonk here, but I do feel we are doing the simulation community a disservice by referring to these new additions to Radiance as a whole new thing, with a whole new name. Indeed, the foundational tool (rtcontrib) for the three-phase CBDM simulation paradigm was initially released five years ago. (!) Rtcontrib and the other new tools were formally released a month or so ago as Radiance v4.0, and I submit to you all that ?Radiance Version Four? (Radiance v4.x) is what we should be referring to when we talk of using Radiance at the most basic, ?bare metal?, form, to perform daylight coefficient-based annual simulations -- with or without complex fenestration systems (CFS), user interactions, blinds, etc. 

Were the tools in Radiance v4.x to be packaged in such a way as to be more easily used, either with a GUI or some sort of web-based frond end, that end result certainly would deserve and require a name like Dynamic Radiance, much like Desktop Radiance was a fitting title for the Windows/GUI project from LBNL, which was a stand-alone program that used Radiance. Today we have Daysim and SPOT and IESve that are also standalone software tools in their own right that use Radiance under the hood or behind the scenes or at its core or around the curtain or whatever phrase you like to use. 

Applied in the traditional manner, so-called ?Classic Radiance? refers to a single light-backwards raytracing step to solve for global illumination for a single point in time. So-called ?Dynamic Radiance? is in actuality not a product or single tool, but the process of using the new Radiance tools to employ a three-phase approach to CBDM; we are still talking about a light-backwards step, albeit this time multiple light-backwards steps to build up matrices for applying BSDFs to simulate CFS in an annual daylighting simulation context. It?s a change in process (and a very important addition in capability), but the tool is the same and should be called the same thing. 

Radiance has a marvelous evolutionary history spanning two plus decades; tools, materials and geometry primitives have all been added to Radiance over the years to add functionality to the suite. Yes, some real game changing tools have recently been added to Radiance, but it?s still Radiance. Let?s call the tool what it really is (Radiance v4.x), and agree to another term(s) for the process. Currently, this process is known as the three-phase approach, but I?m sure we can come up with a more interesting/fun one, or five or six that we can all argue over. 

Papers will be written and presentations will be given over the coming months and years that discuss this process and its underlying tools. Codes, standards and building rating systems will evolve, adopting these tools and methods as their agents of formulation and refinement, and for determining compliance. All I would like to see are some sensible definitions and usage here. 

Respectfully, 
Rob Guglielmetti

Hi Rob,

I 100% agree, Radiance has always been able to be used for "dynamic" 
simulations, as it has always been scriptable. The fact that over the 
last few years, several additions have been added in for the convenience 
of people working with weather data does not even touch the core. I know 
that people like the brand-alike words a lot, but it is misleading here. 
The fact that Radiance got the name it carries is one of the brilliant 
things in it - it reflects the fact that it simply models radiant 
transfers and at the same time already gives the units. This is clear. 
"Dynamic" can be anything - sounds great but is not clear. So - why not 
write what we are doing - using e.g. Radiance with models based on 
weather-data?

Cheers, Lars.

Hi,

I may be wrong, but I see two different primary applications. As far as 
I understood, rtcontrib is optimized for operation with weather data. 
Especially patch-based sky models seam to be a perfect application. The 
photonmap is currently not all that efficient in these applications. On 
the other hand, it allows to include a forward-raytracing step without 
modifications in the scene (well, maybe adding photon-ports to 
optimize). Maybe it is because of I never did it, but modelling a facade 
with non-planar light shelves sounds scary to me to attempt using 
rtcontrib, while almost trivial using the photon-map. On the other hand, 
I admire the potential of rtcontrib when used with sky patches or a 
bunch of light sources. Maybe it is because there is no such compact 
documentation available for using rtcontrib with redirecting structures 
as the photon-map manual. So - from my perspective - it would be perfect 
to have both. Pmap to easily include a very generic forward raytracing 
step. Rtcontrib as an optimization for those who know what they are doing.

Cheers, Lars.

Hi,

I must admit I've fallen into the trap of using the term Dynamic Radiance myself.  It's so easy and succinct.  But I've realized that using that name is a disservice to everyone.  Potential new users have enough confusing quirks to navigate without the addition of a phantom program.  And as a current user I don't want to add another frequent question to the list:  "Where can I get Dynamic Radiance?"

I agree with Rob's suggestion of using the term "Radiance version four" instead of "Dynamic Radiance" to describe the recent version of Radiance (including new utilities).

Andy

Greg and all,
It seems that I was running the scene with an Ambient resolution that was
too high. I ran the scene at ar=2056 and had problems with frames dropping
with the fisheye cameras and then again with section perspectives (clipping
plane). I reduced the ar=1028 and all was well. The renderings turned out
fine and no frames were dropped.
Thanks,
Nick

Hi Nick,

I have no idea what was causing this, but Jack de Valpine said offline  
he's seen similar issues with rpiece and image sections (pieces) that  
have very little going on, like the corners of your image.  It may be  
a race condition that the NFS lock manager isn't handling properly,  
but nothing I can really do much about.  I don't know how the ambient  
resolution would affect this, so it's a puzzle.  It could just be  
coincidence.

In related news, I just made an enhancement to the "rad" executive  
program to run rpiece automatically when -N is set >1 and only a  
single view is being requested.  It even does automatic recovery if  
the rendering gets interrupted.

Best,
-Greg

Hi Lars,

Thanks for starting the conversation...  It may work best if the  
originators/maintainers of the various software explain what they see  
as the strengths and weaknesses of what they've developed, and those  
who have used it can chime in with their experiences.

Rtcontrib is essentially an interface to rtrace that runs it in such a  
way that individual ray contributions can be tallied.  Because there  
are so many ways one might want to do this, the command-line interface  
is quite complicated, as is interpreting the output.  There is no  
interface directly to weather files or data, and a lot of other tools  
and scripts are needed to make it truly useful.  That said, here is a  
quick list of strengths and weaknesses, with mention of related tools  
for rtcontrib:

Strengths
========

o Records contributions or coefficients between source rays and scene  
surfaces.

o Separates the notion of ray-tracing from the notion of generating  
images or values.

o Can compute daylight coefficients or lighting contribution components.

o May also be used to track flux through optical systems.

o Output is binary or ascii data files or component/coefficient  
pictures.

o Use with genklemsamp, genskyvec, and dctimestep for annual  
simulations with BSDFs (illuminance values, animations, etc.)

o Use with pcomb for combining component images.

Weaknesses
==========

o Difficult to use in a stand-alone fashion.

o Uses Monte Carlo path tracing, which does not make use of irradiance  
caching.

o Results can be noisy if parameters are set improperly.

o Won't explicitly do forward ray-tracing, but with some effort it is  
possible to trace flux and create a candlepower distribution.  (See  
2006 Radiance workshop presentation below.)

o Less useful for single time-point calculations.

Dear List, 

 

I am trying to simulate a scene with a number of specular reflections
into a cavity.

I was trying to use the trans material to this goal, as I want to have
specular reflections combined with some light transmission.

After having the simulation running for 17hours I received this message

 

rpict: system - out of memory in makevsrc

 

these are my rendering parameters

 

-dp 2048 -ar 104 -ms 0.26 -ds .2 -dt .05 -dc .75 -dr 3 -sj 1 -st .01 -ab
4 -af myscene.amb -aa .1 -ad 1536 -as 768 -av 0.01 0.01 0.01 -lr 12 -lw
.0005

 

Would some change to those parameters allow me to run the simulation or
too many specular reflections are bound to cause problems?

 

Thanks for your help in advance,

 

Best,

 

Giovanni

Hi Giovanni,

I see nothing wrong with your parameter settings, so it may have  
something to do with your scene description.  You must be using the  
"mirror" primitive in order to generate your virtual sources -- is  
this correct?  How many surfaces do you have using the mirror type?   
Is it a large surface tessellated into many smaller polygons?  The  
fewer surfaces you hand to the virtual source calculation, the better  
it will do.  I've never encountered this error before.

Rob:

Thanks for the well-put diatribe.  I would have to agree to your 
arguments.  I had thought that the term "Dynamic Radiance" had been used 
in only local activities like IESNA etc, but given its publicized use in 
a symposium involving stakeholders from the US and EU as well as 
conference papers for IBPSA and ACEEE, it has the danger of confusing 
the general Radiance community and setting a precedent of "ownership" to 
an otherwise free and easy, open source code model of collaboration.

Greg Ward has been more than generous with his efforts to keep the 
Radiance community alive at a subsistence level, I might say, and his 
efforts have been aided by some incredible talent world-wide 
(Mardaljevic, Reinhart, Andersen, Fraunhofer, EPFL, LBNL to name a 
few).  The rtcontrib tool evolved from mardaljevic (dissertation) to 
reinhart (daysim) to nytimes project (greg's implementation).  Modeling 
of complex fenestration systems (CFS) with BSDFs has an even longer 
history starting with work at LBNL in early 1990s to define the models 
and build experimental systems to measure BSDFs, to Window6-BSDF link to 
mkillum and validation by Ward/Mistrick/ LBNL last year, to creation of 
rtcontrib-bsdf (or rtcontrib4.0 or rtcontrib') via HMG/ SCE and LBNL 
funding.  If none of these activities had happened through the hard work 
of others and shared with the general Radiance community, the new 
version of rtcontrib would never have materialized.  More work is needed 
to validate rtcontrib' (LBNL is in the process of doing this work; 
collaborators welcome) and make the tool accessible and useable by the 
general Radiance community. There's still a lot of work to be done to 
make simulation of optically complex fenestration systems routine and 
this will require world-wide collaborative efforts to make this happen. 

By the way, the term "dynamic" in Dynamic Radiance is meant to encompass 
CFS, annual simulations (temporal/ spatial variations), operable facade 
elements like automated blinds, but this makes things even more 
confusing in my humble opinion.  We've been able to do annual 
simulations with TMY data and split flux method (ok not great) and 
operable facade elements for two decades using DOE-2.  Daysim has been 
doing annual simulations and operable facade elements for the past 
5-10(?) years.  What's new is the modeling of CFS.  This method has been 
"documented" in the Radiance Workshop last year -- Andrew McNeil will be 
working on additional documentation with Greg Ward to make this feature 
more accessible to the Radiance community. 

Another postscript: I think new software titles that include the word 
"Radiance" has to be pre-approved by LBNL. 

best, el.

The end of the week, as many of you know, featured a new Daylight Symposium organized by Lisa Heshong (which was an amazing and heroic event).

But I believe that the creation and subsequent misuse of the term ?Dynamic Radiance? is leading us toward a blurred distinction between the tools and the techniques of climate-based daylight modeling (CBDM), and that this should be addressed.

Core components of the Radiance toolkit have once again evolved, this time to support climate based daylight modeling (CBDM) in an efficient manner. The resultant new Radiance programs are largely the result of a support effort for the work being done by Lisa Heshong and Heshong Mahone Group in support of the IESNA?s Daylight Metrics Sub-Committee, and this work is being reported on a fair amount these days as the all the pieces of that important research come together. As a result, these new tools that were added to the Radiance toolbox, starting with rtcontrib and ending with all the recent tools developed to make rtcontrib usable by mortals (genklemsamp, dctimestep et al.), ended up getting a generic catch-all phrase for ease of use in discussion and in PowerPoint slides: ?Dynamic Radiance?.

I understand the need to wrap the new developments into something linguistically tangible; Lisa was one of the first people to have to refer to these new tools in a meaningful way in papers and presentations (and I saw many over the last week and previously). But I would argue that the core tools rtcontrib, genklemsamp and dctimestep are merely the latest additions to that wonderful collection of programs (rpict, rtrace, and over seventy others) which already exists, and for the past two decades has been collectively called, cited, and referenced as, Radiance.

Maybe I?m being a semantics wonk here, but I do feel we are doing the simulation community a disservice by referring to these new additions to Radiance as a whole new thing, with a whole new name. Indeed, the foundational tool (rtcontrib) for the three-phase CBDM simulation paradigm was initially released five years ago. (!) Rtcontrib and the other new tools were formally released a month or so ago as Radiance v4.0, and I submit to you all that ?Radiance Version Four? (Radiance v4.x) is what we should be referring to when we talk of using Radiance at the most basic, ?bare metal?, form, to perform daylight coefficient-based annual simulations -- with or without complex fenestration systems (CFS), user interactions, blinds, etc.

Today we have Daysim and SPOT and IESve that are also standalone software tools in their own right that use Radiance under the hood or behind the scenes or at its core or around the curtain or whatever phrase you like to use.

So-called ?Dynamic Radiance? is in actuality not a product or single tool, but the process of using the new Radiance tools to employ a three-phase approach to CBDM; we are still talking about a light-backwards step, albeit this time multiple light-backwards steps to build up matrices for applying BSDFs to simulate CFS in an annual daylighting simulation context. It?s a change in process (and a very important addition in capability), but the tool is the same and should be called the same thing.

Yes, some real game changing tools have recently been added to Radiance, but it?s still Radiance. Let?s call the tool what it really is (Radiance v4.x), and agree to another term(s) for the process. Currently, this process is known as the three-phase approach, but I?m sure we can come up with a more interesting/fun one, or five or six that we can all argue over.

Subject: [Radiance-general] illum-like behaviour for sky dome
Message-ID: <4BF9A378.4060003@gmail.com>

Dear list,

I have a brightfunc applied to the glow of the sky dome. I would like 
this pattern to be visible to the camera, but use a normal gensky 
generated sky for all sample rays.

Conceptually, this is similar to the illum type where a different 
material is applied when the object (the sky in my case) is viewed directly.

I did try with illum:

skyfunc glow skyglow
0
0
4  1 1 1  0

skyglow brightfunc bracelet
2 band bracelet.cal
0
0

skyfunc illum skymat
1 bracelet
0
3  1 1 1

skymat source sky
0
0
4  0 0 1  180

This works, but results in about twice the horizontal illuminance 
compared to a normal glow sky. The sky now takes part in the direct 
calculation (this works with -ab 0), and all light expectedly emenates 
from the zenith. So using illum is not an option.

Many thanks for your ideas

Axel

What about separating the skies into two different octrees, then
combining two images with pcomb? If you render your intended visible sky
with zero ambient bounces then it won't contribute to the scene
illumination in its image. And if the gensky is defined as an illum (or
somehow masked out afterward) it will contribute only to the scene
illumination and be otherwise invisible in the composite.

Hi Axel,

Your sky is probably twice as bright because without turning on direct  
jittering, all ray samples will be taken from the zenith, neglecting  
to integrate the cosine factor.  You can try again with -dj 1, but I  
don't think you'll like the noisy results.

A better approach is to remove the significant low frequencies from  
your sky, replacing them with the desired gensky or gendaylit  
distribution.  See the following entry in a thread from a couple years  
ago:

	http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-May/005046.html

Christopher's suggestion is also a good one.  You can save the depth  
buffer using the -z option, convert it to an image, then use pcomb to  
select for depths greater than 1e9 as the sky, like so:

	rpict ... -x 1024 -y 768 -pa 0 -pj 0 -vf view1.vf -z view1.zbf  
scene.oct > view1.hdr
	rpict ... -x 1024 -y 768 -pa 0 -pj 0 -vf view1.vf sky_only.oct >  
view1sky.hdr
	pvalue -r -h -y 768 +x 1024 -df view1.zbf | pcomb -e  
'sel=if(gi(3)-1e9,2,1)' \
			-e 'ro=ri(sel);go=gi(sel);bo=bi(sel)' view1.hdr view1sky.hdr - \
			| pfilt -1 -r .6 -x /3 -y /3 > filtered.hdr

The sky_only.oct contains the nice, captured sky you wish to  
reproduce.  The final pfilt improves the appearance substantially.   
The -pj 0 turns off the usual pixel jittering, which can lead to some  
aliasing but is necessary to get exact pixel correspondence between  
renderings.  I'm sure you can figure out the rest, fixing any mistakes  
I made above.

Cheers,
-Greg

Yes, well, I also tend to goof -- forgot the -b option needed for pvalue.

Chris, Greg,

thank you for the suggestions and for reminding me about the -pj 0 
option which is important in this case.

I took the liberty of uploading a zbuffer image for those of you that 
have never seen one (I don't think there is that many applications for it):
http://www.luxal.eu/pickup/zbf_normtiff.jpg

A zbuffer stores the distance to the objects as a grey value: Black is 
very close, white very far away. When converting the zbuffer file to an 
image, the -p[RGB] option needs to be set, since the zbuffer has only 
one channel.

pvalue -r -h -y 768 +x 1024 -df -pG view1.zbf > zbf.hdr

The approach suggested by Greg works well. However, I ended up with a 
slightly different approach: Image one has the normal sky and is 
rendered with 'normal' options. Image two has the fancy sky in it and is 
rendered with -ab 0, making all objects except the sky black (as long as 
the sun is switched off). I then use pcomb, telling it to use the pixel 
from the normal image if the fancy sky image is black at that point, and 
to use the pixel from the fancy sky otherwise.

RES=600
rpict $AMB -pj 0 -x $RES -y $RES -vf views/nice.vf \
normal.oct > images/normal.hdr
rpict $AMB -ab 0 -pj 0 -x $RES -y $RES -vf views/nice.vf \
bracelet.oct > images/fancymask.hdr

pcomb -e 'sel=if(gi(2),2,1)' -e 'ro=ri(sel);go=gi(sel);bo=bi(sel)' \
images/normal.hdr images/fancymask.hdr > images/combined.hdr

Here is the final result, with the solar bracelet 'painted' onto the 
sky. The zebra stripes indicate the hours of the day:
http://www.luxal.eu/pickup/combined_pfilt.jpg

I did not pursue the mapping approach further since my solar bracelet is 
parametric rather than an image.

Cheers

Axel

Hi All,

Has anyone out there done any daylight modeling for LEED projects? We're 
considering it, but wondering about how the LEED process affects things. 
Perhaps the glazing factor option is the way to go, instead of full-on 
modeling? And what about this sky condition, clear skies at noon on the 
equinox...including direct sun? Really? Not daylight factors under the 
CIE 10k? Sure, neither are perfect, but...

Hi Cramer,

I've done a fair amount of daylight modeling for LEED
certification/documentation -- more than I'd like to have done, honestly!
At my last job, we would use the glazing factor method if the spaces were
simple enough, and rely on Radiance models for the more complicated
designs. There are spaces that are simply not supported by the glazing
factor method, and then you need to rely on better tools like Radiance or
AGi32 to do the required simulations.

The sky condition is, admittedly, a gross simplification. Better than
daylight factors for predominantly clear climates, though. But you're
right, neither are really adequate for quantifying the daylighting on an
annual basis. Hopefully the emerging tools in Radiance v4.x, and planned
improvements to AGi32, will provide more thorough climate based daylight
modeling capability to more users, and that this practice will find its
way into the emerging daylight quantity and quality metrics, and building
rating systems.

- Rob G.

Hi Cramer,

It all depends on the complexity of the spaces.  The corporate HQ project I
mentioned some time ago looks like it will meet NC 2.2 Platinum
requirements.  We've got Tim Metcalf at Kalwall doing the LEED NC2.2
Daylight modeling as we speak (they keep their glazing properties
proprietary for the skylights).  It is a ca. 1972 2 story Federalist box
which is redesigned with a lot of curtainwall, two central atria with
Kalwall roof skylights to supplement the perimeter offices with punched
windows.  Glazing Factor doesn't work in our case because there are a
variety of openings that interact with the interior spaces (and it is
conservative, no bounce).  Option 3 (measurement) looks like it might work
based on some preliminary test I did at the site, but who it is time
consuming and problematic near the great Lakes around the equinoxes.  I'll
let you know what the modeling tells us.

How's it going?

Regards,

Gary

I apologize that this is not really a post regarding Radiance but hopefully is still applicable to some users. 

Does anyone know of any professional daylighting groups or societies? Especially one that is geared toward the consultant? I am aware of the Daylighting Collaborative at the Energy Center of Wisconsin, however their membership pricing structure does not seem to be geared toward the independent consultant, but more toward larger manufacturers. I have asked them about changing their pricing structure, but they do not seem to want to budge. 

Would anyone be interested in starting such a group with me? Or in persuading the Daylighting Collaborative into changing their pricing structure? Email me directly at jilldalglish@yahoo.com

As you will see, it's more than a little problematic.

Subject: [Radiance-general] dumping xglaresrc result to a file
Message-ID: <4BFD4539.80404@gmail.com>

Folks,
I am writing a script that will take a bunch of HDR files and run the 
glare analysis.
How can I dump the result of xglaresrc to a file (in PNG format, for 
example)?
By default xglaresrc is calling ximage in the background, so I will end 
up with a lot of windows. What I want is to capture those pop-up windows 
and dump it to a file.
Thanks,
Ery

How much scripting are you willing to do? If you can relate the output
of findglare to the graphic representation in xglaresrc ("use the
source ...") you could reproduce the output with a simple drawing
library like ImageMagick.

Other than that you could create a shell script that

1) starts xglraresrc
2) waits a few seconds for the highlights to appear
3) takes a screenshot of the ximage window with xwd
4) kills ximage/xglaresrc
5) repeat with next image

Regards,
Thomas

Thomas,

Thanks for the suggestions.

I am trying to avoid the first option that you suggested below. I get 
the impression that it is more difficult. Can you elaborate further?

I tried your suggestion to use xwd. The problem with this route is that 
both the ximage (which is called by xglaresrc) and the xwd are 
interactive programs. We end up trying to automate something that is 
interactive.

The catch is how to select the window to be dumped. The xwd by default 
asks the user to click on the window to be dumped. I tried to use the 
HDR file name as the window_name and pass it to xwd. Something like:

$ xwd -name sc01jd_view.hdr -out sc01jd_view.xwd

It works but (1) it assumes that no other window is on top of this 
window and (2) it captures what is displayed. The first catch means that 
we cannot do anything else on the computer while the script is working. 
The second catch means that if the xglaresrc picture is bigger than the 
monitor (e.g. netbook screen) the picture is actually cut.

For now, I think I can live with that.

Thanks,

Ery

ximage is interactive if you have to adjust the exposure of the image
first. I think you could use pfilt on the image first to get a
reasonable exposure adjustment that displays nicely without further
tweaking. A pfilt preprocess will help with oversized image, too.

xwd is only one app to create screenshots. On Linux you have plenty of
other choices. I would have thought the biggest problem would be to
identify the window. If you can use the image name, fine.

As long as you use a screenshot based method you will always have to
keep the screen free of other windows. If you can't find the time to
let the computer run for a while and you need to do this type of
highlighting a few times you should invest some time in a script that
replaces xglaresrc without ximage. It really doesn't seem that
complicated. Initially I even thought it was a shell script ...

You should reduce the size of large images to something that fits on
your screen. Remember to run findglare again on the smaller size
image! xglaresrc uses a fixed text height and if you have a huge image
the text labels will look tiny.

Problem solved then.

Yes, Thomas. The solution I have works for now. I still want to look at 
the other option (the first option you suggested) because I need this to 
run at least under linux and mac. That solution seem to be more platform 
independent. I will keep you posted.
Thanks for your help,

I believe a surface modeled with the material type "light" behaves as a diffuse source. You can use the lampcolor table to calculate the RGB definition based on lumens and surface area.

How will you calculate the brightness of this diffuse surface at various points along the light shaft?

In a recent project I used mkillum to calculate the light available to a
disk at the top of the building, then moved the disk down to the level where
I wanted the light pipe to terminate. The output was reduced by 6% per meter
which is a value the manufacturer mentioned in one of their brochures
(although on the phone they were much more pessimistic about the performance
of a very long light pipe).

I don't know if this is an accurate way of calculating the performance. If
you think a light pipe is a realistic option in your situation I would
recommend a mock up.

Message-ID: <AANLkTimX-TYa4WS355opj_64RnzOseGpaE5QMZ-aksax@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Radiance experts,

I'm new to Radiance and appreciate if you can help me on this simple
question:

The following commend in the Shell of Unix will get the horizontal
irradiance value due to the uniform sky as defined in the sky_uni.oct file:

% echo "0 0 0 0 0 1"  |  rtrace  -h  -r+  -w  -ab  1  sky_uni.oct

May I ask in order to do the same thing what DOS commands I should use do
the same thing in the command window of a Windows XP or Vista system when
I'm using the Desktop Radiance?

Thank you!

Ji

First of all: In your command below you need to substitute the "-r+"
with a "-I+" (upper case i). If you copied this command correctly from
your source then you need a better source of information.

You can create a file "points.txt" with "0 0 0 0 0 1" in it (ASCII
text file, not a Word doc!). These are basically the coordinates of
the point you want to test (0,0,0) and the direction in which you
point your virtual sensor (0,0,1 = "up"). Now use this command on the
DOS prompt:

rtrace -w -h -ab 1 sky_uni.oct < points.txt

Later on you will want to test more than just one point. Then you can
just add a new line for each point to the file and you will get one
line of output (r,g and b value) for each line/point.

PS: If you can install applications on your system then you should
replace the Radiance installation from Desktop Radiance with a more
recent version. You can download a Windows installer for the 3.9
version here:

Hi!

There are some papers out there trying to give algorithms for  
calculation of flux through mirror pipes. Two typically unsolved  
problems are that they either assume purely diffuse or purely specular  
reflection, and are difficult to apply to different sky conditions -  
cloudy, sunny, all the distributions are hard to get in there. It is  
possible to do simulations in radiance, which may require extensions.  
However modelling a complete system is challenging.

By the way, depending on what you are exactly modelling, glow may be a  
useful option. I do not know how large these luminous areas are  
though...

Cheers, Lars.

My apologies for any cross postings.

 

Dear all:

 

Some of you and/or your associates might be interested in a three day
executive education program on 'Daylighting Buildings' that we will be
offering on July 14-16 2010 at Harvard University, Graduate School of
Design. During the three days we will be covering a range of daylighting
design analysis techniques ranging from rules of thumb to
state-of-the-art Radiance simulations and high dynamic range photography
for glare analysis. The main simulation programs used will be
Rhinoceros, SketchUp, and/or Ecotect for CAD modeling as well as
Radiance, Daysim, Evalglare, and Photosphere for climate-based daylight
modeling, glare analysis and solar radiation assessments. To those who
know Grasshopper, we will be showing you how to generate animated
Radiance/Daysim simulations such as the ones on our web site
http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/research/gsdsquare/ABPS.html. Program
participants will further get a paper copy of a new, 50 page document on
daylight simulations. You can sign up for the program at
http://execed.gsd.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/exec_ed/details.cgi?offering_id=10
1838. Feel free to contact me for any content-related questions. Please
contact Ms. Margaret Moore De Chicojay
(margaret_moore_dechicojay@harvard.edu) for any administrational
question.

 

FYI. There was a long debate on climate-based daylighting metrics at a
recent two day Daylighting Forum in Las Vegas which was attended by
representative from IESNA, AHSRAE, USGBC and other organizations. It
seems likely that some of these organizations will soon introduce such
metrics into their standards and guidelines. So, sign up and stay
competitive.
