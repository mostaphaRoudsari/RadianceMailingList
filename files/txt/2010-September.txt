Thank you for your prompt reply, Lars!

Actually, one of our colleagues who leads me to post this question also has
the same conclusion that for SVF calculation using Radiance, the vector of
the sensor should always be pointing to the zenith regardless of the
orientation of the normal of the surface.

Hi

The sky view factor (SVF) is defined as the fraction of visible sky as seen from a given point. Thus a totally unobstructed point should get SVF=1
A point located just in front of a vertical facade should get SVF=0.5

For the calculations SVF can be defined by the ratio of two projected solid angles:
SVF= Omega_p / Omega_h
where Omega_p is the projected solid angle of the sky as seen from the point p of interest and Omega_h is the projected solid angle of the unobstructed sky hemisphere which is equal to Pi
Then we have SVF=Omega_p / Pi = Omega_p*L / Pi*L 
where we just introduced an arbitrary uniform luminance for the sky vault
Then because the illuminance calculated at point p is E_p = Omega__p*L we can rewrite:
SVF= E_p / (Pi*L)
E_p can be calculated with rtarce -I
If we choose L=1/Pi then the SVF is directly SVF = E_p

So what you need is a uniform sky with L=1/Pi as defined like this:

void glow white
0
0
4 .318309886 .318309886 .318309886 0
white source uniform_sky
0
0
4 0 0 1 180

Note that you don't need to define the ground (because SVF is just about the sky...)

Then to compute SVF for some points:
rtrace -h -w -I -aa .... | rcalc -e 'SVF=$1;$1=SVF'

For the calculations, I think it is better to specify direction vectors pointing towards the true normal direction of the relevant surface.

Objet : [Radiance-general] the vector of sensor in SVF calculation

Dear Radiance experts,

According to the paper "Compagnon, R. (2004). Solar and daylight availability in the urban fabric. Energy and Buildings, 36(4), 321-328", we can use Radiance to calculate Sky View Factor by "using a uniform sky model of arbitrary luminance L and by computing the illuminance Ei without taking into account the contribution of interreflections to ensure the integration is performed over the unobstructed part of the sky vault only".

The formula is: SVF = Ei / (PI * L).

We use the following to define the uniform sky with a horizontal diffuse irradiation of 100 w/m^2:
#########################################################
!gensky 6 20 +15.0  -a 1.0 -o 103.0 -m 105 -u -B 100.0 -g 0.0

skyfunc glow sky_glow 0 0 4 1.0 1.0 1.0 0

skyfunc glow ground_glow 0 0 4 1.0 1.0 1.0 0

sky_glow source sky 0 0 4 0 0 1 180

ground_glow source ground 0 0 4 0 0 -1 180
#########################################################

We use the following specification for rtrace to calculate the irradiation of a sensor point:
aa=0.1, ab=1, ad=4096, ar=512, as=1024

We then divide the irradiation value of the sensor point as obtained by 100 (the unobstructed horizontal diffuse irradiation as specified for the "-B" option of gensky) and this will give us the SVF of that sensor point.


According to the way of calculating SVF as introduced by Compagnon (2004), my question is:
Should the vector of the sensor point being measured always point upward to the zenith (in other words, the xyz vector for the sensor is 0 0 1) no matter how the normal of that sensor point might oriented to?

For example, if we try to calculate the SVF of the centroid of a tilted polygon (a non-horizontal and non-vertical plane), should we specify the vector of the sensor as 0 0 1 or as the xyz vector values of the actual normal of that polygon?


Thanks!

Ji

One more thing:
If you have a single surface under the sky, its SVF can easily be calculated as: SVF=(1+cos(a))/2 where a is the tilt angle of the surface (a=0 for a horizontal surface; a=90 for a vertical surface; a=180 for an horizontal surface oriented towards the ground)

You can then check your radiance calculations by comparing your results with this formula.
For instance by printing a graph like this:

bgraph | x11meta
Adata=!"cnt 181 | rcalc -e '$1=0;$2=0;$3=0;a=$1*PI/180;$4=sin(a);$5=0;$6=cos(a)'  | rtrace -h -w -I -aa 0 -ab 1 s.oct | rcalc -e '$1=recno;$2=$1'"
Bdata=!"cnt 181 | rcalc -e 'a=$1*PI/180;$1=recno;$2=(1+cos(a))/2'"
xlabel=tilt
ylabel=SVF

You should see that the two curves totally overlap!

Hi Rob,

It should just work.  Pcond ignores values below a certain threshold (10^-7 cd/m^2) and they are reproduced as black in the output.

Are you having a problem with a particular image?

X = x * Y / y
Y = Y (of course)
Z = -(Y * (x + y -1)) / y

Wolfram Alpha can solve equations, which was really useful when I was 
tired and didn't want to fiddle with the algebra.

Err... isn't it Optics in the LBNL toolchain outputting the optical 
properties of glazing? That one is supported by a special preprocessing 
tool "optics2rad". From the manpage:

optics2rad converts Optics 5 output to correct Radiance input.

Does this help?

Cheers, Lars.

This looks like BRTDF data, maybe, and I suspect it can be used. Any

Hi Randolph,

My guess is you're looking at angular transmittance and reflectance data.  This can be used, but would need to be translated into a brightdata modifier on a trans material.  There is no program to do this for you, but the translation is not particularly difficult if you only care about transmission.  I'm guessing that "Vtc" is visible transmittance, which you could put into a Radiance .dat file with an appropriate header:

# Visible transmittance data from Window 5a
1
0 90 10
0.620 0.624 0.615 0.604 0.590 0.560 0.493 0.364 0.175 0.000

Your scene file would then reference this data.  Let's assume you put it into a data file called "glazing1.dat":

void brightdata glazing1_angT
4 noop glazing1.dat . acos(Rdot)/DEGREE
0
0

glazing1_angT trans glazing1_trans
0
0
7 1 1 1 0 0 1 1

-------
The above material will have zero reflectance, whereas you seem to have quite a bit of reflection from this glazing.  I am confused by the duplicate Rf and Rb lines, so I don't know what to do with them.  You probably need to employ the BRTDfunc material to handle this properly, converting the data into functions using tabfunc.  That would take a little more time and thought, and I'm not sure it's worth the effort given the other unknowns.

-Greg

Hi Randolph

the duplicate Rf Rb values are for solar properties. The first three  
lines are visual (or light), the next three are solar, the following  
two are the (solar) absorption in pane 1 and pane 2.

I seem to remember that Optics has an export function "radiance input  
data". Below is an old "recipe" what to do with the data ... it is not  
really verified, though.

Advanced Glazing
The default material ?glass? has its limitations in regard to  
reproduction of optical properties of modern selective glass products.  
A different approach is recommended.
In LBNL Optics, chose the coated glass of interest and export this to  
?Radiance Format? (file export)
The resulting file has entries of the type
void  BRTDfunc    YME0185_6_front
10
       0.044     0.053     0.060
       0.817     0.852     0.839
       0 0 0
       .
0
9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

void  BRTDfunc    YME0185_6_back
10
       0.037     0.043     0.042
       0.817     0.852     0.839
       0 0 0

where the first triplets are RGB reflectance values. In the header  
part of the file, the location of the coating (front or back) can be  
found ? in this example, the back side is coated.
Now open the Perl script ?glaze? (in /opt/rad/bin or wherever Radiance  
resides on the computer) and edit / add an entry for the coated glass  
in the lines
set sn_arr=("clear glass" "VE1-2M low-E coating" "PVB laminated"  
"V-175 white frit" "V-933 warm gray frit" "SYP YME0185" "SYP YDE01-2M"  
"SYP YRE0146")
# Glass-side hemispherical reflectances for each surface type:
set rg_r_arr=(0.074 0.065 .11 0.33 0.15 0.044 0.053 0.291)
set rg_g_arr=(0.077 0.058 .11 0.33 0.15 0.053 0.050 0.320)
set rg_b_arr=(0.079 0.067 .11 0.33 0.15 0.060 0.051 0.371)
# Coating-side hemispherical reflectance for each surface type:
set rc_r_arr=(0.074 0.042 .11 0.59 0.21 0.037 0.055 0.087)
set rc_g_arr=(0.077 0.049 .11 0.59 0.21 0.043 0.048 0.057)
set rc_b_arr=(0.079 0.043 .11 0.59 0.21 0.042 0.056 0.135)
# Hemispherical (normal) transmittance for each surface type:
set tn_r_arr=(0.862 0.756 0.63 0.21 0.09 0.817 0.734 0.419)
set tn_g_arr=(0.890 0.808 0.63 0.21 0.09 0.852 0.786 0.480)
set tn_b_arr=(0.886 0.744 0.63 0.21 0.09 0.839 0.717 0.458)
# Boolean whether coatings can have partial coverage:
set part_arr=(0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0)

Now run the ?glaze? script and follow instructions. The output is a  
detailed glass description which should be copied into the  
?Material.mat? file of the Radiance model.

It looks to me like the file that Randolph has generated is from the WINDOW
5 program not Optics. 

 

Optics5 does generate the file that Achim refers to below.

Hi Randolph,

My guess is you're looking at angular transmittance and reflectance data.
This can be used, but would need to be translated into a brightdata modifier
on a trans material.  There is no program to do this for you, but the
translation is not particularly difficult if you only care about
transmission.  I'm guessing that "Vtc" is visible transmittance, which you
could put into a Radiance .dat file with an appropriate header:

# Visible transmittance data from Window 5a

0.620 0.624 0.615 0.604 0.590 0.560 0.493 0.364 0.175 0.000

Your scene file would then reference this data.  Let's assume you put it
into a data file called "glazing1.dat":

void brightdata glazing1_angT
4 noop glazing1.dat . acos(Rdot)/DEGREE
0

glazing1_angT trans glazing1_trans
0

7 1 1 1 0 0 1 1

The above material will have zero reflectance, whereas you seem to have
quite a bit of reflection from this glazing.  I am confused by the duplicate
Rf and Rb lines, so I don't know what to do with them.  You probably need to
employ the BRTDfunc material to handle this properly, converting the data
into functions using tabfunc.  That would take a little more time and
thought, and I'm not sure it's worth the effort given the other unknowns.

Message-ID: <57821.88.233.19.64.1283702279.squirrel@webmail.mimtarch.com>

Dear All,

I am trying to simulate an external environment with artificial lighting.
The default fixtures that Ecotect have as LIGHT objects are placed in the
model. When I export this model to radiance, I get the following error:

3020: WARNING: Light object 87 is producing no light - check color and
lumen output.

Indeed, when I look into the RAD file, I see the following:

FloodlightNoShielding_dist light FloodlightNoShielding
0
0
3 	0.000 0.000 0.000

When I render it this way, there is no artifical lighting. When I convert
the "0.000" values to "255", then I get the desired result. Now, the
problem is, there are so many fixtures in the model that I cannot edit the
RAD file each time before simulation. Why is Ecotect creating the RAD file
with these values? Is there a bug or is there something that I am missing?

Thanks for any help.

So and how is your "FloodlightNoShielding" defined in Ecotect?

You don't want to use the display RGB values here (range 1-255). The
three values define the intensity of the light source in W/m^2. The
right value for your _flood_light depends on the definition of the
distribution and the size of the fitting in the model.

Bug is always possible with Ecotect but I expect that - as the error
suggests - you definition of the light (a type of material in Ecotect)
is wrong.

Is it possible to keep a place for me on standing by? If I'm coming I
would also like to attend the advance course on Wednesday. If so can I pay
the registration on arrival?

Even if I can't make it Axel will.

Luisa

I just wanted to add that LBNL is increasing its support for Radiance work, and plans to revamp the website as well as fund a number of improvements to the basic engine.  Thanks to LBNL, California Edison and HMG, we have new annual simulation capabilities for complex fenestration, and I am just finishing a new tool for computing BTDFs from geometric descriptions, which I will present at this year's workshop.

This is an ideal time for you to come and lobby for things you wish to see added to Radiance and improvements you would like to see to the website, which we finally have some budget to update over the next fiscal year.  We are also very interested in collaborations on annual energy simulation and BSDF measurement and modeling.

Hope to see you in Freiburg on the 20th.  If you are interested in complex fenestration systems, don't forget to sign up for the Wednesday course as well.

Best,
-Greg

Hello Thomas,

Thanks for the reply. The funny thing, I am not defining the lights in
Ecotect myself, I am using the default materials. In all cases, those 3
values are 0 (actually sometimes 0.001). And I see no way of modifying
those values even though I have played with all the material properties.

So and how is your "FloodlightNoShielding" defined in Ecotect?

> Indeed, when I look into the RAD file, I see the following:

You don't want to use the display RGB values here (range 1-255). The
three values define the intensity of the light source in W/m^2. The
right value for your _flood_light depends on the definition of the
distribution and the size of the fitting in the model.

Bug is always possible with Ecotect but I expect that - as the error
suggests - you definition of the light (a type of material in Ecotect)
is wrong.

Thomas

Depending on the version of Ecotect (5.5 works, 5.6 doesn't) you can
try and place a file in your material repository folder. Ecotect can
then look for each material for a file with the same name in this
folder and will use the contents of the file instead of converting the
material properties - which is does pretty badly anyway.

So find your material repository, create a file called
"FloodlightNoShielding.rad" and add a working light description to
this file. Then export again with the right option - I forgot the name
but it's pretty obvious.

If that works and changes your light definition in Radiance we can
then talk about what should go into this file. If it doesn't work you
can also export the lights as markers and replace the markers with the
proper Radiance description after the export.

Thomas

Hi!

> DO we need to buy the train ticket in advance from frankfurt airport?

Typically it is easier / cheaper if you get a ticket online some days in 
advance (www.bahn.de). However, you can also get it at the train 
station, which is attached to the airport. ICE is the fastest train 
class, IC and EC are also fast - if your take a RE or RB it will be some 
small banlieu-train, avoid it!

Cheers, Lars.

Message-ID: <AANLkTikQoyhKPquh949pneW7FfoTT=Ww8YxzMM0=7Aym@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Radiance-gurus!

I am trying to simulate a 'realistic' control of artificial lights. What you
traditionally would do is to control the lights based on illuminance levels
at specified points on the working plane. But in reality you would have a
sensor placed somewhere in the ceiling looking downwards or looking towards
the window. So, in stead of having the sensor points on the working plane I
would like to use the illuminance reading from my photocell placed e.g. on
the ceiling.

I have two questions, one considering the rsensor program and one
considering how to combine the rsensor output with rtcontrib.

1)
What I get out of rsensor can be illuminance readings for the specified
photocell?
The following command would generate the illuminance-level on the sensor,
right?

rsensor -ab XX -i [sensor view] sensor_file scene.oct > illsensor.dat

2)
>From Axel Jacobs tutorial on rtcontrib I can see how I can obtain
illuminance readings from photocells defined as points - but how should I do
it if I am not interested in the point illuminance reading, but interested
in the illuminance level falling onto the sensor that doesn't see an
hemisphere?
Can I somehow replace the
$ cat workingplane_photocell.pts | rtcontrib .........

with
$ cat [sensor view] sensor_file....| rtcontrib...??

Hope my questions make sense!

Best,
Anne

Besides all the handy tools to support such modeling tasks, the most 
generic approach would be to render an image of what the sensor sees, 
and integrate the pixel values - if possible weighted with the angular 
response of the sensor. That way you can really work out the signal the 
sensor should give, and you can use the image both to understand why you 
get an observed reading and to debug. Provided of course that you know 
the angular sensitivity and the exact field of view (which could be 
determined in lab if necessary).

Cheers, Lars.

Message-ID: <1F994EE20CC4154DBB59DDE3100F906B04545054@USNWK102MSX.ww017.siemens.net>

We want to simulate the lighting conditions in a building with the
RADIANCE Software.
The Simulation depends on the natural and artificial light and the
window blinds.
After this simulation, we want to send the results from RADIANCE to a
simulation software called TRNSYS.

Here are my questions regarding this topic:
	Is it possible to couple RADIANCE with TRNSYS?
		Does RADIANCE only image-files (as output) produce?
		Have anybody of you,  connect TRNSYS with RADIANCE
successfully? 
		And have you any tutorials or other useful
documents/links?


Thank you in advance.

Regards,
Marion Kerl

Hi Lars,
Thanks for your VERY quick reply!
Yes - that was also my initial approach. But in order to get the illuminance
falling on the sensor I need to know the reflectances of the surfaces in the
image in order to convert from luminance to illuminance. And the
reflectances might vary, so I was wondering if I could use another approach.
..hmm..and I am not that familiar with all the handy tools ;o)...but maybe
there is a chance that we can discuss this at the workshop next week.

There are vending machines on almost every platform to buy the ticket in  
advance with payment in cash or credit card. They have a multilingual GUI,  
so you can't go wrong. I'd recommend them over buying the ticket on board  
 from the conductor, as it incurs a surcharge... and the machine is often  
friendlier. ;^)

Definitely. Unless you wanna experience the dregs of western society at  
play AND vandals at work. Plus it will take you 1/2 day/night to reach  
your destination (IF you reach your destination), since they stop every 10  
mins at cowtowns you won't even find on the map! Repeat: do NOT take RE/RB!

Actually, rsensor computes photosensor response on the sensor -- which WOULD
be illuminance assuming the sensor's response was a perfect cosine one, but
the final output of rsensor ultimately is photosensor response. So your
command above would send the sensor response to STDOUT.

Lars proposes an image based approach to evaluating what the sensor "sees"
and integrating a weighted response. This in effect is what psens (Chas
Ehrlich's project) does, on a single image. This is the tool Zack Rogers
used in SPOT's initial versions, and it was SPOT that led to the development
of rsensor in the first place. What you are trying to do above is to apply
the daylight coefficient approach to deriving the photosensor response, and
I think it's no secret to anyone watching this mailing list over the last
year or so that this is a subject of great interest to us all and some of us
are working on this to some degree. The reason for the interest is that with
daylight coefficients, we can do annual simulations with hourly resolution
(and even incorporate occupant response (blinds, etc) and complex
fenestration systems), in a reasonable timeframe.

The promise here is being able to leverage new tools in the Radiance toolkit
to not only calculate annual daylight availability and quality metrics, but
to carry that capability through to the ever-crucial follow-through on the
electric lighting side -- the daylight-responsive lighting control response
-- and to study this at an annual/hourly resolution. This would allow us to
inform whole building energy simulation tools and really start to understand
the energy impacts of daylighting in a holistic way.

We at last have tools to get us partway there. These would be rtcontrib,
genskyvec, and dctimestep. With these we can compute DCs for task plane
illuminance, but also -- critically -- sensor points on the ceiling or some
arbitrary location/aiming. But we still want to be able to weight the
contributions by the photosensor response. For this, I could imagine a cal
file inserts itself into this workflow, maybe dctimestep accepts an
additional argument for a cal file and there's a "signal" option for passing
all this to rsensor. (?)

Kung Fu Feature Request:
OR, as we gather up all the DCs and weight them by the sky luminance, could
we ALSO weight them by photosensor response, BEFORE summing and computing a
signal? My sense is that this is not possible but I don't fully understand
all the ray accounting that is possible in rtcontrib. Perhaps this could be
a new feature? (???) (!!!)

We are working on rtcontrib-based tools here at NREL and are basically at
this very crossroads. I believe others out there are "there" too, and I
wanted to file this reply since it will have to serve as a proxy for my
attendance at the Workshop next week. =(

Very exciting times.

Hi Marion,

You should have a look at Building Controls Virtual Testbed (BCVTB): https://gaia.lbl.gov/bcvtb/FrontPage

BCVTB can be used to link various simulation programs.  The user manual describes how to use Radiance with BCVTB (it's done via system command actors to call scripts).  TRNSYS is on the list of programs to be connected with BCVTB, but I don't think it has been done yet.  

Michael Wetter at LBNL is the person to contact about BCVTB and connecting simulation programs.

Best,
Andy

Hi Rob, Anne, Lars:

Indeed, a very interesting discussion.  It's a shame you won't be in Freiburg next week, Rob, as we're going to be looking at some of these issues.

It should be possible to modify rsensor to output a set of ray samples as input to rtcontrib, then use the -c option of the latter to sum together these samples into a set of daylight coefficients for that sensor.  I have looked at this a few times and decided that it's more than an afternoon's work to modify rsensor appropriately, so have left it for "later."  This would be the most efficient method by far.

The alternative that is possible with the software as it is involves post-multiplying the output of rtcontrib on a standard hemispherical ray distribution to weight the results according to the sensor sensitivity distribution.  It wouldn't be easy, but I think one could accomplish this with the appropriate combination of rcalc, Perl, etc.

Best,
-Greg

Hi,

You can try mixfunc and mix transparent material (for glazing) with non
transparent (for frames). If you want to add wall between,then use previous
mixture and mixfunc it with wall material.

For that you'll need some cal file with definition which material should be
'active' for which position on the polygon surface.

Hope this idea helps,
Marija

Very interesting threat Randolph. I have been recommending to my
students to simply reduce the visible transmittance of the glazing by
20% (assuming a 20% frame to window ratio). That way they can still work
with glass and have a fair chance of getting it right. What do you all
think of this?

Hi,

You can try mixfunc and mix transparent material (for glazing) with non
transparent (for frames). If you want to add wall between,then use
previous mixture and mixfunc it with wall material.

For that you'll need some cal file with definition which material should
be 'active' for which position on the polygon surface.

Hope this idea helps,
Marija

Keep in mind if you have a thick mullion at close spacing it could start to cut off light at certain angles. In that case the actual geometry will be more accurate than a flattened estimation.

Depends on what you want to find in your simulations. The shaded regions 
may be of interest if you are looking into glare, and may switch a 
sensor. For an overall annual assumption of daylighting potential you 
may be fine with the uniform transmission approach. Mark Stock has some 
nice cal-file to create a facade with uniformly distributed openings, 
but in general mixfunc is perfect to describe such systems. Of course 
unless the facade / mullions are not flat but have a thickness to 
consider (again for e.g. glare).

Cheers, Lars.

What I just did on a project was to run the building model in Daysim to determine the light level in lux achieved in each space and generate an 8760 report.

Then I determined what fraction of light as compared to the design light level I would achieve through daylighting.

The power fraction reduction is [1-(sensor lux/design lux)].

Then I have a artificial lighting schedule for my building within the Studio that I multiply the schedule fraction by the daylight fraction to get the actual artificial light fraction for that hour.

Something you should be aware of is the limitations of your ballasts. If the ballasts are stepped or can only dim to 50%, you will need to add more logic to properly represent your lighting control system.

Also, make sure if you are controlling your blinds in radiance to reduce glare that you use the same algorithms in TRNSYS because of the solar heat gain on the windows.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Hello Kent,

I actually was just presented a response by another user, Cramer Silkworth. I am unfortunately not too familiar with Radiance, but here was the response.

Best regards,

Matt Duffy

"Both trnsys and radiance are very powerful simulation engines. Though graphical interfaces for both exist (built-in with Trnsys, in Simulation Studio, and as add-ons for Ecotect and Sketchup for Radiance), they are most powerful when used like a programming language - ie, modifying their text input files directly. This gives you the most control, and once you learn their syntax, I'd say easier than the graphical interfaces. Especially for parametric studies.

If I were to want to couple radiance and trnsys for a project, I'd be using DaySim as a front-end for radiance. Version 3 is on the verge of final release (workable beta is available now - www.daysim.com<http://www.daysim.com/>), and it's free. It essentially runs radiance for your geometry in an annual simulation (with weather data), can handle active shading and electric lighting, and has numerous outputs - including one intended for coupling to trnsys. Then you just need to set up your trnsys model to read this file from daysim (it comes with a generic data file reader component), and then you use your results to modify your lighting power accordingly (or whatever variable you want to respond to lighting conditions). I can't say I've used too many other daylight & energy modeling programs, but I'm fairly confident there are very few if any other programs out there that can handle such a coupling as detailed as trnsys & daysim/radiance can. I've heard of it being done with eQuest, but I think the eQuest side of things is a bit limited. There are other daylight simulation programs as well, but Radiance is always talked of as being the industry 'standard.'"

Dear TRNSYS users,

I am on the Radiance users list and the following question regarding TRNSYS was posted in that group.  I believe they want to control the window blinds & the zone's artificial lighting based on lumens entering the zone:

We want to simulate the lighting conditions in a building with the RADIANCE Software.
The Simulation depends on the natural and artificial light and the window blinds.
After this simulation, we want to send the results from RADIANCE to a simulation software called TRNSYS.

Here are my questions regarding this topic:
      Is it possible to couple RADIANCE with TRNSYS?
            Does RADIANCE only image-files (as output) produce?
            Have anybody of you, connect TRNSYS with RADIANCE successfully?
            And have you any tutorials or other useful documents/links?


Thank you in advance.

Thanks, everyone.  I'm still experimenting--I'll let you know how it turns out.

Christoph, I decided not to use reduced transmittance because I wanted 
shadow patterns.  YMMV.

Hello,

Thank you for the answers from last week. They were very helpful.

I installed Radiance for windows. I used the instruction file "A
survival guide to
Radiance on Windows " from the 7th International RADIANCE Workshop in
2008.

Could you recommend any tutorials and manuals to start with Radiance?

I'm not sure, how I will start to introduce myself in Radiance.

Thank you in advance.

Here are some links to introductory documents:

http://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/learnix/docs.shtml

Look for the "Radiance Tutorial" PDF in the middle of the list.
Although these documents are centered towards Radiance on Unix/Linux
they also focus on the basics principles which you should be able to
translate to another platform.

One of the things they seem to mean is "Clean up your Rhino model."  
Another thing they probably mean is "Don't rely on WIP software."  But 
it would be nice to know a bit more for the future.

Dear Randolph,

I have encountered this before with a complex Rhino model as well. Luckily  
OBJ files are plain text.

In my case, a few of the points in my obj file were given a normal of 0 0  
0 which obj2rad did not like. I fixed it by running a find and replace on  
"vn 0 0 0" with "vn 0 0 1" without any negative consequences.

The specific errors of bad face or triangle seem to come from bad vt  
(vertex texture-coordinate) data in your OBJ file, so I would start by  
looking there.

Best regards,
Alstan

...but it came back for a sequel.

The following example OBJ file fails with "bad face:"

> f 1//1 2//2 3//3 4//4

It's a rectangular face in the Y-Z plane, the vertices are ordered 
counter-clockwise, and the vertex normals are pointing in the X 
direction.  Reversing the vertex directions makes it go.  It looks 
right to me, but I wonder if I'm confused about clockwise & 
counterclockwise.

Ah, well.  To be continued tomorrow.

Message-ID: <1F994EE20CC4154DBB59DDE3100F906B045D4E3E@USNWK102MSX.ww017.siemens.net>

Hello,

as you can see from my last mails, I want to simulate a building in
radiance. 

I installed radiance with the linux emulator cygwin on my pc and made my
first steps with the a tutorial from the official RADIANCE website.
This tutorial describe to create a room with one window by generate a
rad.-file. I think it will takes a long time, when I want to generate
the hole building with these rad.-files.
Is it possible to accelerate these process? Are there any tools
available, which can input the CAD data in RADIANCE?

Another topic are the lamps in RADIANCE: How is it possible to get lamp
information in RADIANCE? Exits there any tools, too?

I hope anybody have answers of these questions. May be you can recommend
some documents or tutorial to gain more knowledge in these topics.

Thank you in advance.

  Hi Marion,

There are a number of 3D modeling applications that can be used to 
develop models that can then be exported and used in Radiance. Some 
tools that people use to do this include:

   1. Autocad
   2. Revit
   3. Rhino
   4. Sketchup

There are certainly other tools that can be used as others will likely 
point out. Depending on what tool you pick there will be various steps 
for converting the geometry for use in Radiance. Rhino and Sketchup 
probably have the most direct path to Radiance currently, however it is 
certainly possible to go from Autocad or Revit to Radiance as well.

For lighting there are two basic things to understand:

    * Layout - layout of different lights in the building can be
      accomplished in your modeling application. This is typically done
      using triangular reference markers as placeholders for the
      lighting distribution
    * Lighting Distribution (IES photometry) - with markers indicating
      the position of the lights exported to Radiance, lighting
      distribution data can then be located relative to these markers.
      (using the radiance tools: "replmarks" to locate objects relative
      to markers and "ies2rad" to convert ies data files to radiance
      light objects)

Please note this is a very cursory explanation to give you some idea 
that yes it is possible to go from 3D modeling application to Radiance! 
How much you can accomplish is going to be dictated in part by you 
experience with 3D modeling tools and a willingness sink yourself into 
learning Radiance for what you want to accomplish. What kind of 3D 
modeling applications are you familiar with?

Regards,

  Hi Christopher,

I will confirm that Blender exports OBJ that can be converted to 
Radiance. It also has a few tools for doing operations on meshes. It is 
a pretty robust application so there is some learning curve for sure.

Best,

-Jack

Yes.  Exporting to OBJ, the old Wavefront format, and importing to 
Radiance using obj2rad is a popular one right now.  If you are using 
SketchUp, Thomas Bleicher has an export plugin which you can download.  
There are some AutoCAD export tools--look on the web--, but Autodesk 
has been making it steadily more and more difficult to distribute any 
tool without paying royalties to Autodesk, and so far no-one has been 
willing to take on the problem.

> Another topic are the lamps in RADIANCE: How is it possible to get lamp 
> information in RADIANCE? Exits there any tools, too?
Basic tools are part of the package.   IES photometry for the luminaire 
can be bound to a few simple surface forms, which can then be used to 
wrap visible lamp geometry.  ies2rad does the basic job of taking an 
IES photometry file and converting it to Radiance format, but coding is 
required to create a lamp that both radiates light and has a visible 
form.

Good idea.  I've been using the automatic meshing of Rhino export, 
which I expect to produce correct models, but if I manually meshed the 
model, that might help--maybe I'll try it.

I don't know how many people are aware of Meshlab. I use it on 
OSX and Linux to read, process, and write triangle meshes. It 
contains a large variety of filters and tools to modify and clean 
trimeshes, including recalculating normals, removing duplicate 
nodes and faces, etc. It works on .obj and other mesh formats.

There is even anelaborate Radiance-frontend for Blender.

http://www.bozzograo.net/radiance/index.php?module=Pages&func=display&pageid=1

I have been using formZ, which combines CAD and modeling functionality, and exported obj files. Obj files are the best supported input besides the native Radiance formats rad and mgf.

However, I think it is a good idea for a beginner to follow the tutorial and create at least one scene by hand. It helps understand what geometry will be in Radiance, give some understanding also on limitations when using CAD, and may be helpful if you ever expect problems.

Cheers, Lars.

Dear all:

 

I am looking for an affordable (<$3000) set of devices that can measure
the spectral power distribution of light sources in the visible range as
well as wavelength dependant surface reflectances. Does something like
this exist? At the NRC we had a $10,000 Minolta spectrometer that
measured wavelength dependant diffuse reflectances as well as overall
specular reflectance. Are there any more affordable devices? What are
you using for light sources?

Christoph,

Imaging technology is awfully cheap these days. I think something could 
be improvised with standard filters and a moderately-priced camera, but 
it would take some expertise to design, fabricate, and calibrate.  
Design expertise, of course, we have on this list, fabrication and 
calibration, not so much (at least, I don't think we do.)  Have you 
thought about wandering over to your local physics department & asking 
for help?  Or perhaps to MIT?  It might make a good student project.

Hi,

There are cheap photospectrometers available starting at $1000, but if you want to measure total luminous flux or diffuse reflectance, you will need an integrating sphere. The sphere is the expensive component of such a setup.

Cheers, Lars.

Well, there's always PAB. If he can design, fabricate, and calibrate  
goniophotometers, I'm sure he'd be up to spectral power measurements. ;^)
(Is PAB still on this list?)

Chris, we missed you at the workshop, btw.

Any specific recommendations to look for in this range, or explanation why the Minolta would be any better?

I was particularly miffed at missing the Workshop this year -- so I'm particularly keen to see the presentations online. And, hopefully, material from the Advanced Fenestration course also.

Any ideas when?

Hi John and all other members,

Must say that Workshop was really nice!
I would like to thank again to Jan and Sandra for excellent organization,
and to Greg for making such good software as Radiance. And, of course thanks
to all other people who were able to attend Radiance Workshop this year, and
who made it really interesting and useful for Radiance users.

I'm also impatient to see presentations online, and try some of the things
related to complex fenestration :)

Also if some photos are available from the workshop (Greg, Chang, Axel?)
please put them somewhere on web!
I'll put mine photos in a few days, and send the link on the list.

Thanks again for wonderful time in Freiburg,
Marija

Hi John,
Hi Radiance group,

we will transfer the presentations as soon as possible to the web-site.
Unfortunately Sandra and I are sick and not at ISE (Hi Alstan... ;-) )
in the next days - so maybe next week.

Thanks to all presenters again - they made the workshop so interesting!

Best,

Jan

Hi Jan & Sandra,

thanks again for your efforts in organising this event -- exhausting but  
fun as always! Also interesting to visit ISE again after several years.

Welcome to the club... :P(

Hi Randolph,

I ran your OBJ snippet through the HEAD version of obj2rad, and it didn't complain.  I made some recent changes at the request of Jack de Valpine.

Subject: [Radiance-general] fisheye images & evalglare
Message-ID: <AANLkTikyxihaCn1wUE+x6AA4DtpD_mmrNXW8_Ooia+EG@mail.gmail.com>

Apologies for the cross posting, just trying to cover the bases.

I have been experimenting with a new camera and Sigma 8mm fisheye lens,
creating HDR images for input to Jan Wienold's/Fraunhofer's evalglare
program. On the really long exposures, you can actually see the back end of
the lens and I guess some of the internals of the camera body itself. While
this is exceedingly cool/interesting, I wonder if this is impacting the
validity of the HDRs. When I create a Radiance HDR image (-vth) I get these
nice round images with totally black corners. With the camera, I end up with
a rectangular image and as I said some luminous pixels on the long
exposures. Is this a problem, and how do folks deal with this in practice?
Even if it's not a problem from an accuracy standpoint, aesthetically it's
nice to produce photos that look like the Radiance fisheye output.

Thanks...

Hi Rob,

You need to check what the values of those border pixels are.  Chances are, they are quite low compared to the circular image, and you are only seeing them because of the tone-mapping compression going on in Photosphere, assuming that's what you're using.

Best,
-Greg

Just a quick follow-up on this.  There was some talk about the need for ray sample directions out of rsensor, so I added this feature to the current HEAD.  You simply specify a dot ('.') rather than an octree to get a set of sample rays instead of a summed result.  Give it a try!

Message-ID: <CE689C83-220B-457C-99C4-FE739AC6DA8A@gmail.com>

Thanks to all who came to this year's workshop, especially to Jan Wienold and Sandra Mende who did an excellent job on organization.  Thank you also to the presenters -- I thought this was a very interesting set of new developments this year from multiple quarters!

On the topic of next year's workshop, we have two proposals:

A)  The first is from LBNL to host the 10th Radiance workshop in Berkeley, California, where it was last held in 2003.

B)  The second proposal is from Rapha?l Compagnon, the host of the first workshop in 2002, who forwarded an offer from SERIS to host next year's workshop in Singapore.  The workshop has never been held in Asia.

We had an informal vote at the workshop, and there seemed to be some interest in both venues, with a slight leaning towards Berkeley.  I didn't think it fair to make a decision on the spot, however, since many parts of the world were under-represented in the audience.  So, I am writing to the general list in hopes of getting some further opinions and eventually reaching a consensus on the matter, so that plans may be laid.  In particular, I wonder who would be able to make it to a workshop in Singapore, given airfares and funding approval, etc.

At the same time, if people have a preference for dates, please speak now.  We are looking either at late August or early October if the workshop is held at LBNL.  I don't know if SERIS has a preferred time -- perhaps Rapha?l can fill us in on that?

Finally, I need to clarify a misunderstanding I seem to have caused by an earlier e-mail regarding LBNL funding.  While it is true that there is money this fiscal year to further Radiance developments, LBNL is not hiring at present nor looking to spend the funds elsewhere, as the positions that were available at the beginning of the year are now filled, and the funds have been earmarked for projects already underway.  

However, if other research organizations are interested in cost-sharing collaboration (i.e., each institution covers its own expenses and personnel), this could be possible if the project goals are suitably aligned.  This is nothing new, except for the fact that there is significant ongoing work now at LBNL, particularly in the area of complex fenestration, controls, and annual simulation.

Best,
-Greg

my two cents thoughts:

Airfares from Europe would be very much the same. In fact, in late August, the north-Atlantic-to-west-coast route is likely even more expensive then Europe to Singapore. Aug to Mid-Oct is still high season for USA, but not so much for Singapore (except during racing days down there, around end of September). With hotel prices and cost of living lower in Singapore, the whole trip is likely even more economic for Europeans.

A hands-on approach to the tropics might also remind us Westerners on the northern sphere about different sun paths, shading strategies and materials.

Last, but not the least, Asia, the regions around Singapore and relatively close-by India are regarded as upcoming regions, with an increase in building activities. So for advances in daylighting in those regions and helping to avoid mistakes already experienced by others, it would be more efficient to show expertise in Singapore than an annual gathering of the already converted at LBNL. The audience would include more new users and perspectives that way, which would be in the interest of LBNL as well.

And that's not even mentioning our Radiance folks down-under and ongoing work there.

best regards
Peter

Subject: [Radiance-general] Next year's workshop

Thanks to all who came to this year's workshop, especially to Jan Wienold and Sandra Mende who did an excellent job on organization.  Thank you also to the presenters -- I thought this was a very interesting set of new developments this year from multiple quarters!

On the topic of next year's workshop, we have two proposals:

A)  The first is from LBNL to host the 10th Radiance workshop in Berkeley, California, where it was last held in 2003.

B)  The second proposal is from Rapha??l Compagnon, the host of the first workshop in 2002, who forwarded an offer from SERIS to host next year's workshop in Singapore.  The workshop has never been held in Asia.

We had an informal vote at the workshop, and there seemed to be some interest in both venues, with a slight leaning towards Berkeley.  I didn't think it fair to make a decision on the spot, however, since many parts of the world were under-represented in the audience.  So, I am writing to the general list in hopes of getting some further opinions and eventually reaching a consensus on the matter, so that plans may be laid.  In particular, I wonder who would be able to make it to a workshop in Singapore, given airfares and funding approval, etc.

At the same time, if people have a preference for dates, please speak now.  We are looking either at late August or early October if the workshop is held at LBNL.  I don't know if SERIS has a preferred time -- perhaps Rapha??l can fill us in on that?

Finally, I need to clarify a misunderstanding I seem to have caused by an earlier e-mail regarding LBNL funding.  While it is true that there is money this fiscal year to further Radiance developments, LBNL is not hiring at present nor looking to spend the funds elsewhere, as the positions that were available at the beginning of the year are now filled, and the funds have been earmarked for projects already underway.  

However, if other research organizations are interested in cost-sharing collaboration (i.e., each institution covers its own expenses and personnel), this could be possible if the project goals are suitably aligned.  This is nothing new, except for the fact that there is significant ongoing work now at LBNL, particularly in the area of complex fenestration, controls, and annual simulation.

Best,
-Greg

I agree with Peter that having a Radiance workshop in Asia would help to widen or firmer establish the Radiance community in an important region. Having said this, the workshop will only be effective if a sufficient number of us are planning to go. It might be beneficial to piggyback on another conference, e.g. Building Simulation will be in November in New Zealand. I do not think that too many people will want to fly to Asia twice in only a couple of months.

Hi Rob,

in the current version of evalglare only angular views are supported!!
Don't use -vth. We will change that with the next release, but until
then the only supported view-type is -vta. Using -vth will return wrong
values!
By the way -usually most of the available fish-eye lenses are angular,
not hemispherical.

Another important issue: If you use programs which might change the view
(like pcompos) , the view string in the header is obsolete and the
standard view (-vtv, vh=45,vv=45) is taken by the radiance
routines(which we use in evalglare), which also results in completely
wrong results!!! The fatal thing is, that you still see the old view
string if you look at it when using getinfo, it is just a tab added to
"disable" the view string.
This caused a lot of trouble in the past and we will change now also the
command line options of evalglare, so that you have to provide the view
each time when you call evalglare. This will be also included within the
next release. Until then, be sure that image has the correct view
options without tab and -vta is used!

Jan

That sounds great Greg - THANKS. I'm *so* ready to give it a try.

Have problems installing the HEAD though: Just downloaded the HEAD, but
cannot download the auxiliary files - they are not available on the server.
Dependent on the changes it isn't always necessary with new auxiliary files,
right?? So I have tried to run ./makeall install without new auxiliary
files. Unfortunately I'm getting installation errors. For all the
directories in src I get the error "exec: make: not found."
---------
make error:
...
In directory util...
/usr/local/ray/bin/rmake: line 2: exec: make: not found
...
---------

FYI - my rmake script is as follows:
#!/bin/sh
exec make "SPECIAL=ogl" \
    "OPT=-O2" \
    "MACH=-DBSD -DNOSTEREO -Dfreebsd -I/usr/X11R6/include -L/usr/X11R6/lib"
\
    ARCH=Intel "COMPAT=" \
    INSTDIR=/usr/local/ray/bin \
    LIBDIR=/usr/local/ray/lib \
    ESUFFIX= \
    CC=cc CONFIGURE_ARCH=i386 "$@" -f Rmakefile


When searching the archives I can see that some of the installation errors
might be due to the dev tools not being installed, so I have checked this,
and found that in my existing dev directory, /usr/local/ray/bin/dev, the dev
.hdi-tools are: glx1, glx1h, ogl, oglh, oglo, ogloh, ogls, oglsh, oglso,
oglsoh, x11 and x11h.

Anyone know what is going wrong here??
Best,
Anne

-----------------------
-----------------------
Just a quick follow-up on this.  There was some talk about the need for ray
sample directions out of rsensor, so I added this feature to the current
HEAD.  You simply specify a dot ('.') rather than an octree to get a set of
sample rays instead of a summed result.  Give it a try!

  Hi Randolph,

Greg added a feature to obj2rad to enable it to continue in the case of 
bad normals such as: vn 0 0 0. Previously obj2rad would exit with an error.

Backing up a bit, I think what I am interested in seeing is conversion 
tools that further support .obj as an intermediate file format for 
Radiance. There are lots of good applications (Rhino, SketchUp Pro, 
Blender, etc) that support export of .obj format files. And for those 
applications that do not (eg, Autocad and Revit), one route is that it 
is possible to get .fbx out of these applications which can then be 
converted to .obj. However the data output from these applications is 
not always perfect, which results in obj2rad exiting with errors 
relating to: bad normals, bad faces and bad triangles. So the issue is 
what to do in these cases:

   1. bad normals (vn 0 0 0) - are now passed through using the updated
      version of obj2rad from the head release.
   2. bad faces and bad triangles - In some case this is something that
      can be fixed in an application like Rhino or Blender (these are
      the ones that I know) using the repair mesh functionality.
      However, I have also noted that the following can sometimes be
      included by the exporting application: #QNAN0 or #IND. This is
      easy to check for using grep. Typically I have seen this:
      -1.#QNAN0 or -1.#IND. Since these errors occur upstream from
      obj2rad, Greg is rightly loathe to have ob2rad try to fix them. If
      you cannot fixes these in the upstream application, then the easy
      fix in these cases is to use sed or perl to zero out these
      conditions. This can be done as follows (pick your tool):
         1. perl -p -e 's/\#QNAN0/0/g;s/\#IND/0/g' fname.obj | obj2rad >
            fname.rad
         2. sed 's/\#QNAN0/0/g;s/\#IND/0/g' fname.obj | obj2rad > fname.rad

If anyone has other suggestions for managing and processing .obj files 
for use in Radiance please chime in! I know that Mark Stock has had good 
experience with MeshLab, for example.

Best,

-Jack

Right. I suppose if Greg says that a new feature is in HEAD you only
need to update that bit.

You either have no compiler installed or the development tools are not
in your search path.

When you type

    which make

what's the answer from the shell? If you do know that make is
installed you have to check your PATH setting man add it's location to
your PATH.

I have uploaded the photos I took at the workshop, which Jan has as well, to my website:

	http://www.anyhere.com/gward/pickup/RadWorkshop2010/

Clicking on any of the small images gets you a larger one.  A few of them are JPEG-HDR's, but you have to figure out which ones...  The only high-resolution one is the group photo, but everything is chronological, so you would have to scroll down to find it:

Sorry for the sloppy presentation, but it's all I could manage in a short time.

Hi Jan, thanks for the clarifications, and sorry for the confusion. I meant
angular, but typed -vth. I do know that evalglare needs to be working on
angular fisheyes. Thanks for the heads up about the view headers, we will be
careful to give evalglare exactly what it needs to do the proper
evaluations...

While I was looking forward to a North American location for 2011 (making it
easier for me to get funded to go), Peter and Christoph make very good
points. Christoph's suggestion of piggybacking on SimBuild probably makes
the whole thing more palatable for many faced with the prospect of traveling
even further to the workshop than they did this year.

Since this is already off the rails, I'm going to throw another boulder on
the tracks; Jennifer & I were thinking that NREL would be a great place to
host the 2011 Workshop, here in Colorado. I did not realize 2011 locations

earlier. We just finished our new Research Support Facility (RSF), which is
a 220,000 ft^2 net-zero energy building, and we have plenty of other
renewable energy research going on here as well that we could tour/show off,
including our work with Radiance. It's a more central location for North
American folks, but I also respect the many good ideas for having it in
Asia. Just wanted to throw it out there.

Hi Thomas,
Yep, I don't have make installed. 'which make' doesn't return anything.
I'm downloading xcode - and then, hopefully, I'll be ready to run ;o).
Thanks!
Anne

---------------------------
You either have no compiler installed or the development tools are not
in your search path.

When you type

   which make

what's the answer from the shell? If you do know that make is
installed you have to check your PATH setting man add it's location to
your PATH.

Hi all,

well, traditions are there to break them :-) At least sometimes. 

So I like the idea of leaving behind the exisiting habit of alternating locations in Europe vs Northern America and opening up for users in other regions by chosing rotating locations throughout the world from now on.
So I'm supporting Peters and Christophs statement in favor of Singapore (without repeating it here.. )

Also, from a pure personal point of view, occasions like the workshop are good opportunities to go abroad and gain some new experience and insights apart from pure Radiance issues. And I've never been to Asia before..

(I've experienced the luck of having the workshop close by this year, within half an hour's train ride to my home town, so it's OK with me to go abroad again the next time :-)

While I was looking forward to a North American location for 2011 (making it easier for me to get funded to go), Peter and Christoph make very good points. Christoph's suggestion of piggybacking on SimBuild probably makes the whole thing more palatable for many faced with the prospect of traveling even further to the workshop than they did this year.

Since this is already off the rails, I'm going to throw another boulder on the tracks; Jennifer & I were thinking that NREL would be a great place to host the 2011 Workshop, here in Colorado. I did not realize 2011 locations were going to be discussed at the workshop or I would have mentioned it earlier. We just finished our new Research Support Facility (RSF), which is a 220,000 ft^2 net-zero energy building, and we have plenty of other renewable energy research going on here as well that we could tour/show off, including our work with Radiance.

Hi folks,

my two cents thoughts:

Airfares from Europe would be very much the same. In fact, in late August, the north-Atlantic-to-west-coast route is likely even more expensive then Europe to Singapore. Aug to Mid-Oct is still high season for USA, but not so much for Singapore (except during racing days down there, around end of September). With hotel prices and cost of living lower in Singapore, the whole trip is likely even more economic for Europeans.

A hands-on approach to the tropics might also remind us Westerners on the northern sphere about different sun paths, shading strategies and materials.

Last, but not the least, Asia, the regions around Singapore and relatively close-by India are regarded as upcoming regions, with an increase in building activities. So for advances in daylighting in those regions and helping to avoid mistakes already experienced by others, it would be more efficient to show expertise in Singapore than an annual gathering of the already converted at LBNL. The audience would include more new users and perspectives that way, which would be in the interest of LBNL as well.

And that's not even mentioning our Radiance folks down-under and ongoing work there.

best regards
Peter

Thanks to all who came to this year's workshop, especially to Jan Wienold and Sandra Mende who did an excellent job on organization.  Thank you also to the presenters -- I thought this was a very interesting set of new developments this year from multiple quarters!

On the topic of next year's workshop, we have two proposals:

A)  The first is from LBNL to host the 10th Radiance workshop in Berkeley, California, where it was last held in 2003.

B)  The second proposal is from Rapha??l Compagnon, the host of the first workshop in 2002, who forwarded an offer from SERIS to host next year's workshop in Singapore.  The workshop has never been held in Asia.

We had an informal vote at the workshop, and there seemed to be some interest in both venues, with a slight leaning towards Berkeley.  I didn't think it fair to make a decision on the spot, however, since many parts of the world were under-represented in the audience.  So, I am writing to the general list in hopes of getting some further opinions and eventually reaching a consensus on the matter, so that plans may be laid.  In particular, I wonder who would be able to make it to a workshop in Singapore, given airfares and funding approval, etc.

Hi Anne,

Sorry about the missing files -- a lot of things are "not quite right" with the website at the moment.  Soon to be fixed, hopefully.  I have restored the missing files, which you could have gotten from radsite.lbl.gov.

And as Thomas points out, you don't really need this for compiling the 4.1a HEAD.

Hi Greg - I have it up running now. Had to install xcode. Btw: Installing
xcode has some really nice side-effects that I wasn't aware of. Have tried
to install e.g. convert and m4 on my mac but with no luck - have used these
really convenient programs on Linux. However, these programs are included in
xcode, so now rsensor maybe does what I want it to (just need to plot the
rays to verify that I get the right directions) and in addition I can make
use of the other programs. HURRAY!
Thanks again Greg. Have a great day!

And the following mapping file:

If I change "void" to "wood," obj2rad succeeds.

Say, what?

At least, I think I have workarounds.

Hi Everyone,

I understand the appeal of both Singapore and Golden, CO for the Radiance workshop next year.   While everyone is thinking about it I thought I should highlight some of the benefits of holding the workshop in Berkeley - the birthplace of Radiance.

We've increased activity in direct Radiance development, as well as indirect Radiance development including optical characterization, Window 6 for complex fenestration, etc.  We'd like the opportunity to share these developments with the Radiance community.  Those of you at the workshop last week remember that half of my presentation covered LBNL software developments that relate to Radiance - If the workshop is held in Berkeley the people who develop these tools will be able to make an appearance to explain, demonstrate, and take comments and suggestions.  Things are moving at a quick pace, so there will be a lot of new developments to showcase. 

We are planning to offer many seminar options for the pre/post workshop day possibly including:
 - A Seminar with LBNL software teams (Window, Optics, COMFEN, BCVTB, etc) to discuss new and old Radiance related features and proposals for future features.
 - An optical measurement workshop given by the optics measurement team covering theory, equipment & procedures, data formats & data dissemination followed by a lab tour and equipment demonstration (for both specular and complex glazing systems).
 - A Radiance beginner workshop for new users.
 - A discussion of Lighting & Daylighting in the evolving design process - San Francisco is a hotbed of collaborative A/E and owner activity.  LBNL has a lot to discuss in this area.

We also have a windows test bed facility for testing advanced fenestration systems.  We are currently testing automated external louvers, automated awnings, automated venetian blinds, and static and active daylight redirecting systems.  All these technologies are all being cycled (changing every four days - two systems being testing at a time).  We don't yet know what we'll be testing next year, but I'll will do whatever I can to make sure it is equally interesting (I'll take suggestions).

Best,
Andy

So I got rid of the "void"s, and found another apparently good face 
which draws the "Bad Triangle" message.

It's a very long file--the error occurs at line 12104.  So far I have 
not been able to construct a short example; the same face are accepted 
without complaint.  If I don't use a mapping file, the conversion runs 
without incident.  This is beginning to look like an obj2rad bug.

Anyone have a workaround to suggest?  Also, anyone actually used a 
debugger with obj2rad?

Thanks, Randolph.  This was a bug.  Obj2rad is supposed to quietly elide surfaces that map to the "void" type, but this has been broken, perhaps from the beginning.  I just checked a fixed version into CVS.

Thanks very very much for the prompt fix, Greg.  This also fixed my 
second bug, which involved a surface which had no assigned material 
type and was therefore treated like "void", triggering the bug.

Wow.  It seems we are faced with an embarrassment of riches, with multiple attractive offers for hosting next year's workshop -- and the year after that!

I'm going to suggest we have a period for proposals and discussions, after which we'll ask people to vote for their favorites.  I'm going to make it about "attendance probability" rather than absolute preference, asking people to predict their chances of attending the workshop next year based on each of the choices offered.  After all, what matters most is that we get ourselves together for a healthy exchange.  Exotic surroundings are great, but not if only a few people can make it.  I hope there is agreement on this much.

So, let's give ourselves until the end of October to discuss proposals, make our pleas and lobby for our favorites, then we'll put it to a vote during the month of November.  I will take the responsibility of setting up a website where people can cast their ballots for next year.  I'm going to leave the 2012 decision for 2011, if that's OK with everyone.  If we do end up in Singapore next year, I'm going to propose that 2012 be on the North American continent.

Best,
-Greg

Final note on this: if you don't want to run the bleeding edge version 
of Radiance 4.0, make sure your obj2rad mapping file has a default 
material and does not use "void".  As far as I can tell, those two 
things will keep the bug from being tickled.

Perhaps we can start to save our pennies for a potential Singapore workshop
(having checked pricing, I would be challenged to make the trip within a
year), and celebrate the renewed investment of LBL by accepting their
generous extended program offer.
