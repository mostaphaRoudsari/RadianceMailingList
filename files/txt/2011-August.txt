I just wanted to tell that I've tried it and it works! (A bit to my
supprise.)

I have: Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bits.

I followed the guideline on the Radiance Wiki site:
./makeall install in ray folder
chosing ~/radiance/bin installs on Windows in C:\user\yourname\radiance\bin
I choose option 2) Linux (seems to be the best option).

I encountered three problems, here are they, with solution.

Problem 1: (Seems to be related to 64 bit system with 32 bit gcc and 64 bit
or wrong archiver)
This is the error:
Error code 127
AR_LIBRARIAN environment variable
===============================================================================
Solution:
Add: export PATH="/opt/gcc.4.2/bin:${PATH}" to
C:\windows\SUA\etc\profile.lcl
Also see: http://www.suacommunity.com/forum/tm.aspx?m=16624 for more
detailled info.


Problem 2:
Making programs...
/dev/fs/C/Windows/SUA/usr/examples/radiance/ray/src/common
/dev/fs/C/Windows/SUA
/usr/examples/radiance/ray/src
In directory common...
gcc -Dlinux -L/usr/X11R6/lib -L/usr/local/lib/x86 -L/usr/lib/x86
-L/usr/local/li
b/ray -I/usr/include/X11 -DNOSTEREO -O2 -c ezxml.c
ezxml.c: In function 'ezxml_parse_fd':
ezxml.c:647: error: '_SC_PAGESIZE' undeclared (first use in this function)
ezxml.c:647: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
ezxml.c:647: error: for each function it appears in.)
*** Error code 1 (continuing)
`install' not remade because of errors.
===============================================================================
Solution: Included: #define EZXML_NOMMAP in ezxml.c


Problem 3:
In directory rt...
gcc -I../common -L../lib -O2 -Dlinux -L/usr/X11R6/lib -L/usr/local/lib/x86
-L/us
r/lib/x86 -L/usr/local/lib/ray -I/usr/include/X11 -DNOSTEREO -o ./rtrace
rtmain.
o rtrace.o duphead.o persist.o ../lib/libraycalls.a ../lib/libradiance.a
-lrtrad
 -lm
../lib/librtrad.a(header.o):header.c:(.text+0x5b4): undefined reference to
`_tim
egm'
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
*** Error code 1 (continuing)
===============================================================================
Solution: Included timegm.o in src/common/Rmakefile
Like:
UTLOBJ = ezxml.o ccolor.o ccyrgb.o bsdf.o bsdf_m.o bsdf_t.o loadbsdf.o \
 disk2square.o hilbert.o timegm.o

That's all, after that I ran gendaylit and Mark Stock's benchmark test
suite, and all works.

Still need to install an XServer (Xming) and a NFS server (included in
Windows 7 Ultimate).
And run some more tests including rvu, trad, falsecolor, rpiece.

I hope this is usefull,

Guy

Hi, Guy,

Wouldn't it be easier to install Radiance 3.8 or 3.9 in Win7 through
installing DaySim or DIVA for Rhino?

That's how I did in my Win7 64bit Ultimate and the installation will take
care of setting the path and all sort of things.

- Cheers, Ji

Subject: [Radiance-general] HIDE: Another Blender/Radiance project
Message-ID: <CA+dqh63A5X7ZzniYJgemL7ij3MA+RkQgGvAaGcwyDgnTaVt6mg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list,

I recently discovered another Blender/Radiance project named HIDE
(High Dynamic Range Imaging in Design Education).

http://artsresearch.brighton.ac.uk/research/centre/office-for-spatial-research/projects/hide

The idea behind HIDE is to use HDR environmental maps to illuminate
CGI scenes. HDR panos are generated with Hugin, and Blender is chosen
for the modelling and rendering. To facilitate HDR rendering in
Blender, they devoloped the LiVi plug-in for Blender, which does work
with the latest version of Blender.

The project is well documented, and there are even some video
tutorials on their site that demonstated how HDR panos are created,
and how the LiVi Radiance rendering works.

Cheers

Axel

Subject: [Radiance-general] BRTD Function to simulate grid mesh.
Message-ID: <CA9AD81C97DC8841A97AE8C80B043B162982352CEF@EURXMBC04.global.arup.com>

Hi everybody!

I'm trying to set up a BRTD calc file but it doesn't seem to work, can somebody help me digging out how to deal with this, please?

What I am trying to do is to represent the mesh grid attached (image grid_mesh.png) with a plan, which material is a BRTD function. The reason why I am doing this is because I need to keep the model simple and easy to model parametrically. The aim is to get something similar to what is shown in picture example.tiff.

The idea is to use cutoff angles to decide whether or not light goes through the plan (as it does with the actual mesh).

In order to achieve this I set up a vertical plan and gave to it the following material definition which calls the attached cal file (mesh.cal):

void BRTDfunc test
10
1 1 1
0 0 0
test_combo test_combo test_combo
test.cal
0
9
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0

But it doesn't seem to work.

I played with all sort of parameters but it seems to  behave always the same regardless of different cutoff angles declared in the calc file.

I also tried with this material definition:

void plasfunc test
2 test_combo test.cal
0
4 0 0 0 1

And it works as expected, hence, the calc file seems to work.

Any idea on what I am doing wrong or I am missing? Any idea on how to achieve the desired result?

Thank you in advance for your help!

Lucio

Message-ID: <CAFXPCRYv6bC14vL-z9cvTwxmPHrnezVShRJXfj-0KqiPT2aeDg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Ji,

Yes, you're right ofcource, that's the easy way to install Radiance! ;-)

But the idea (and the credits go to Randolph actually) was to see
how wel Radiance would do with SUA. (Subsystem for Unix based Applications).
SUA is advertised as being Unix on Windows, with, well everything: fork,
bash, NFS, X11 support etc.

And it works very wel, today I got rvu and falsecolor running on Win 7.
Trad doesn't work (segfaults) and rpiece only calculates 7 out of 8 image
paches (leaves one black spot),
might have done something wrong because rpiece complained about a -pm
setting.

The performance also isn't bad: 32 minutes for Mark Stock's benchmark test
on a Intel 2600K (@3.8GHz) system.

Best Regards,

Guy

Hi Lucio,

Rather than trying to debug your code, why don't you try mine?  Attached is a cal file I created for Jack DeValpine of Visarc, which should do what you want.  See if you can get it to work.

Best,
-Greg

Guy,

Wow.  That is really wonderful news (and thank you for the credit.)  
That rpiece worked at all is very cool and gives me some hope that we 
can make it work consistently.

Based on this news I am hopeful that we will eventually be able to do a 
proper release of Radiance for Windows Ultimate, if we can find the 
time to do the work.

Message-ID: <CAD83LVLibtb1MzTsuNwnbxE0HHvCVJ1DztFJNpO9n99VGJ3gCw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Radiance experts,

May I confirm with you that the tregenza.cal file as mentioned in the
rtcontrib tutorial (pp.16) by Axel Jacobs is only available in the Windows
version of Radiance installed through installing DaySim or DIVA for Rhino?

Axel's rtcontrib tutorial:
http://www.jaloxa.eu/resources/radiance/documentation/docs/rtcontrib_lesson.pdf

I can't find the tregenza.cal and other .cal files such as reinhard.cal in
/usr/local/lib/ray directory where the Radiance library files are put for
Mac version of Radiance.

If it is the case, can I simply copy those missing library files for the
Windows version of Radiance to the /usr/local/lib/ray directory in Mac?

Thanks!
- Ji

Hi, you can simply copy the cal file to your destination folder.

Hi, all,

BTW, there's only a "reinhard.cal" file in C:\Radiance\lib rather than the
"reinhart.cal" file as mentioned in Axel's tutorial.

Are they the same?

The "reinhard.cal" file is "Erik Reinhard's simple global tone-operator"
according to the header of the file.

Is the "reinhart.cal" file as mentioned by Axel's a different .cal file that
was created by Christoph Reinhart in Harvard? If it is, may I know where can
we find this file?

- Thanks! Ji.

Hi, you can find all the .cal files from the source code located in the LBNL
website. It contains all the cal files you needed.

Hi, Jia, Thanks for your reply!

Do you mean the original Radiance installation package for Unix system:
http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/dist/rad4R0all.tar.gz?

However, I can't find the .cal files as mentioned in my email from that
package.

Can you kindly inform me where to local "all the .cal files" on the LBNL
website?

- Thanks! Ji

Hi, Jia, Thank you very much!

May I know why some of these .cal files are not installed in the
/usr/local/lib/ray or C:\Radiance\lib directory?

Should we manually copy all these .cal file each time after Radiance is
installed?

- Cheers, Ji

Still will have some available for the Workshop...so far.  Get your pre-orders in if you want to make sure to get one!

Randolph

At long last this most necessary reference returns!  We plan to have paper copies ready for the Radiance Workshop.  A downloadable PDF version will follow in six months.

Paper copies are priced at US$35 + shipping.  The PDF version will be available in six months for no charge.  

The books will be a black-and-white softcover for study, marking, tabbing, and use while your screen is covered with your beautiful renderings.  It has a professionally-printed color cover, costs no more than a pile of pages in a binder, and is infinitely more convenient. The color plates from the original will be available online.  

I am taking pre-orders via PayPal to randolph at panix.com.  (You can use a credit card, or send me a PO.)  I'm going to have stock at the Workshop, but only a limited number of copies--I may sell out.  If you want to make sure you get one there, pre-order.  I will not charge shipping if you buy one from me at the Workshop.

We will be setting up a web page for orders.

After the Workshop, I will ship individual books for $6 (media mail) to anywhere in the continental USA.  For quantity orders, or shipping outside the USA, e-mail me at randolph+RwR at panix.com.

Message-ID: <j1q0vs$2ui$1@dough.gmane.org>

I've been tracing a relatively small number of rays through a model, 
and when I added more rays, one of the previous illuminance values 
changed by 9%.  Apparently, the ambient file had been inadequately 
populated.

OK.

So, I need an overture calculation.  I think the easiest way to ensure 
a fairly complete ambient file is to generate small images.  I could do 
six orthographics at maybe 200 pixels long-ways, or a trace a more 
comprehensive grid, or ...  Any suggestions?

Dear Mr. Fritz,

I am a just beginning to learn how to use Radiance, and am very interesting
in ordering a copy of Rendering with Radiance from Vienna, Austria.

 

Would you kindly let me know what the procedure is, and the estimated
shipping costs? I will be in Berkeley in the third week of September.
Perhaps it may be possible to pick-up a handbook then?

 

Thank you.

In general, it is the best to use the same view settings for the 
ouverture calculation as you will use later for the renderings. You want 
a refined ambient cache for areas which are actually of importance for 
your final renderings, so it does not make sense to first create 
detailes ambient data for the whole scene, if you want to render only 
one image later. If you are targeting at creating an animation, just 
skip frames and render a low-res of every 10th or so.

Cheers, Lars.

If you aren't generating an image, but are (as you say) just sending a small number of rays, just run your calculation twice, saving the results to an ambient file.  Should be very quick the second time through.

Thanks to all those who have registered for the 10th International Radiance Workshop.  We have an exciting program with many interesting talks.  I'll post start posting the presentation titles on the website soon.

We can accommodate a few more people at the workshop, email me if you are interested in attending and we can get you registered (even though registration has officially closed).  There are also a limited number of presentation slots left.  If you are attending and think you might like to present, email me ASAP.

I look forward to seeing everyone.

Best,
Andy

PS - Hopefully this is the last email about the workshop I'll send to the whole mailing list until I've posted PDFs of the presentations.  My apologies for spamming those who can not attend.

Message-ID: <CAD83LV+N8GTmL1WMou111b7FYtZGYhS1kyV5QSdRjgKArWPL8A@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Radiance experts,

May I confirm with you that in Radiance there're several conventions
regarding some of the locational information should be specified:

*1. Longitude east of Greenwich* is specified as *NEGATIVE *value: e.g
Singapore's longtitude of 104E should be specified as -104.
*2. A positive azimuth angle *denotes an angle starting from *due SOUTH *and
rotating clockwise.
*3. Standard meridian* of a city equals to the Greenwich Mean Time of the
city multiplied by 15, and a *NEGATIVE *value indicates a timezone *EAST *of
Greenwich (e.g. Singapore belongs to the EAST8 timezone, so it's meridian is
-120=(8*15)*(-1) )

Take London as an example, to know the solar altitude and azimuth at 9:00am
1st Jan at London (altitude 51.15N and longitude 0.18W), the gensky command
is: "gensky 1 1 9:00GMT -a 51.15 -o 0.18 -m 0" or "gensky 1 1 9:00 -a 51.15
-o 0.18 -m 0"

and you'll get:

# gensky 1 1 9:00GMT -a 51.1500015259 -o 0.180000007153 -m 0
# Local solar time: 8.93
# Solar altitude and azimuth: 5.5 -41.8
# Ground ambient level: 6.0
......

and in this case the solar azimuth thus obtained indicates an angle starting
from *due South* and rotating *clockwise *for 41.8 degree.

Thanks!

Ji

I think if you specify the time with a time zone designation like GMT, the -m parameter is ignored.

I have always assumed (but would like to confirm and open for discussion), if you give a date that is outside of the daylight savings time period (say January) but give a time of 9:00BST, would it incorrectly apply the 1 hour offset? In other words, the user or script must manually determine for the date in question, if the time should be given on the command line as 9:00GMT or 9:00 BST.

Hi:

Gensky will not check whether the date is outside the DST period or not.
Even if you specify a data that is outside a DST time period, gensky will
still apply the hour shift.

Jia

You can use an appropriate rotation matrix a la:

	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix

Once you figure out the coefficients, you can apply them in dot products to your origins in rcalc.  For example, rotating about the Y-axis by 41.7 degrees:

	rcalc -e '$3=$3;$4=$4;$5=$5' \
		-e 'th:41.7*PI/180' \
		-e 'c11:cos(th);c12:0;c13:sin(th)' \
		-e 'c21:0;c22:1;c23:0' \
		-e 'c31:-sin(th);c32:0;c33:cos(th)' \
		-e '$1=c11*$1+c12*$2+c13*$3' \
		-e '$2=c21*$1+c22*$2+c23*$3' \
		-e '$3=c31*$1+c32*$2+c33*$3' input.ray | rtrace ...

Hope this helps.

Small goof:

	rcalc -e '$4=$4;$5=$5;$6=$6' \
		-e 'th:41.7*PI/180' \
		-e 'c11:cos(th);c12:0;c13:sin(th)' \

		-e '$2=c21*$1+c22*$2+c23*$3' \
		-e '$3=c31*$1+c32*$2+c33*$3' input.ray | rtrace ...

Also, I'm not sure if this gives you a clockwise or counter-clockwise rotation.  You may have to experiment a bit.

Message-ID: <8D862FA96616154C90B250C3C35AF0CD080D2CAA@EXCSRVBAV05.tri.lan>

Hello,

I need some advice on material creation, I hope not all of you are on vacation :-). I am trying to model a textile facade, and only got reflectance, transmitance and absorptance values for the used material, along with solar factor and visible transmittance, and a color sample...

I think a trans material could be the best option, but I am not sure about my parameters, nor if it will be accurate enough,

I've searched around but I'm afraid I still need some help... thanks in advance!!

A better start would be to obtain test results based on EN 14501 test standards. This would give the direct normal and hemispherical transmission values to help define a trans material. Or does the textile have an "openness factor" defined? This would give an approximation of the direct normal transmission in comparison to the total hemispherical transmission.

How critical is accuracy, and do you have resources and time to arrange for more detailed testing of the fabric and a complex material definition? Or are you just trying to get close enough for comfort?

Can you give a verbal description of the textile? Is it a woven fabric with white threads and some open transparency (eg it is white but you can still see objects on the other side when it's hanging)?

Dear forum,

Will Radiance work on a Unix emulator, say Exceed and Exceed 3D on Windows XP? Sorry of this question is irrelevant.

Hi Jun,

Exceed is not a Unix emulator, but a X-Server. That means it can be used 
to display GUI-windows, most probably also those by Radiance. However, 
you still need to provide a rudimentary unix environment, unless you run 
the Radiance binary on a remote system and use the Xserver only for the 
Gui (e.g. by tunnelling the X-protocol through a X-session. That works 
fine with Radiance as any X-based program.

Cheers, Lars.

Christopher, many thanks for your help. The manufacturer's catalogue displays the information according to EN 14501, so maybe they have this data; I'm waiting for an answer from them.
I'm doing tis for a small competition, so resources are not large, if they don't provide me with data I'll have to guess approximate values and hope for resources to come in case we win :-)
The textile is a PVC coated polyester woven fabric, in a variety of colors, and yes it has open transparency, so if you are close enough you can see trhough it.

You will find a section titled 'Running Radiance on Windows' in my
'Running LEARNIX' document which you can access here:

http://www.jaloxa.eu/mirrors/learnix/docs.shtml

The instructions walk you through compiling Radiance under Windows in
a Cygwin enivironment, and also detail how to get the Xserver running.

An alternative would be to run LINUX in a virtual machine such as
VirtualBox. This will allow you to use rpiece (or, more conveniently,
rpictmt which is a wrapper around rpiece) to utilise all processor
cores for parallel rendering. I'm doing this every day because my
machine at work has Windows on it. It works rather nicely. This
approach is also explained in the same document.

Cheers

Axel

Thanks Lars!

I was stuck at a step during installation of Cygwin and MinGW and was looking for other options. Guess I'll have to resume the installation and might probably ask the forum again if I can't make it work.

Thanks again,
Jun

Hi Jun,

Exceed is not a Unix emulator, but a X-Server. That means it can be used 
to display GUI-windows, most probably also those by Radiance. However, 
you still need to provide a rudimentary unix environment, unless you run 
the Radiance binary on a remote system and use the Xserver only for the 
Gui (e.g. by tunnelling the X-protocol through a X-session. That works 
fine with Radiance as any X-based program.

Cheers, Lars.

Hello Everyone,

At the last minute we have decided to attempt a live stream of the workshop.  Please bear with us if we have technical difficulties.  The workshop schedule is available here: http://radiance.lbl.gov/agenda  The schedule may be subject to last minute changes.  All times are pacific daylight time.

We will use ReadyTalk to share a live-view of the presentations. When the schedule starts, go to http://lbnl.readytalk.com, and enter Access Code 486 5040 under "Join a Meeting". ReadyTalk works on PC/Mac/Linux, using Flash or Java. You can test your computer in advance at: http://test.readytalk.com

We will broadcast the audio (both speaker and our best attempt at audience audio) using NiceCast. To listen to this, you will need to be able to listen to a URL like this:
http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:8000/listen.m3u We will post the actual URL on theradiance.lbl.gov front page at the beginning of each day as soon as we are setup.

To test your audio in advance, you can try out any .m3u stream from this page: http://dir.xiph.org/index.php

Best,
Andy

Hi!

http://128.3.180.13:3389/listen.mu3

leads to a server-generated "The file you requested could not be found".

http://128.3.180.13:3389

leads to a server-generated error 403 "access denied".

Both tested on Chromium, as I could not open the stream.

Cheers, Lars.

Just an idea - if anyone at the workshop switches his video-enabled 
mobile phone on, and everyone (especially the presenters) are happy with 
that, I would happily accept to share the video from my host. Not 
real-time, but a working stream. Feed-back is welcome... cheers and - 
have a nice time folks in Berkley!!!

Memory errors cause the program to terminate, so you shouldn't get any output.

How you managed to run out of memory at this point in the code is a little puzzling...  What options are you using?

Ok, I tried to get some more info on the error. wget is helpful here in 
verbose mode:

wget -v http://128.3.180.13:3389/
--2011-08-24 19:27:33--  http://128.3.180.13:3389/

HTTP-Anforderung gesendet, warte auf Antwort... 403 max listeners reached
2011-08-24 19:27:33 FEHLER 403: max listeners reached.

So there is whatever limit of listeners, and that blocks us. Nothing to 
do on the client-side as far as I can see.

Again, if anyone records and the organisators are fine with a working 
low-tech-solution, switch on your phones :-)

Cheers, Lars.

There was a slight mistake in the URL posted on the website -- it's been fixed (by Andy).  Try:

	http://128.3.180.13:3389/listen.m3u

Sorry for the confusion!

Greg,

it is not related to that, there is a limit in the number of listeners 
of that streaming system locking us out. The file contains just a link 
to the stream, which cannot be opened (http error 403 max listeners reached)

Cheers, Lars.

Hi Greg, it is weird, rtrace is not terminated, the command line window is still there (calculating direct daylight coefficients); my processor is still loaded; it has been running for some hours now...
Standard daysim startup settings with ab reduced to 3 for a faster test, on a large, open plan with lightwells building model created in Sketchup and exported through su2ds. Using default materials (including trans) for now.
It could be an overly complex model... I'll try to skip some detail where possible.

Suggestions accepted :-)

We had to stop the stream to increase listener limit. You should be able to re-join.

Hi,

I just have been able to see the last minutes of the presentation on 
relevant optical measurements by Jacob. Anyways, even from the schedule, 
it is really nice to see a coherent terminology finally - no more 
BTDF/BRDF/BRTDF (or all of these without F), just BSDF everywhere. 
Somehow I do not like the F (as the abbrevation is usually not used to 
describe a function but discrete data, as Jacob just demonstrated when 
talking about measurements), but it is still less confusing like that. 
Maybe the Radiance community will be the first having such a stringent 
terminology :-) I am excited to see the coming presentations...

Cheers, Lars.

I think I accidentally quit the browser or something.  Christian is working to restore it for the next talk.

Unfortunately, I can't get audio working... I think it might be firewall on my end.
I tried the m3u link through many browsers and through iTunes. 
No luck. Slides look interseting!

It is not your firewall. Yesterday there was a limit of listeners that 
blocked people trying to connect. Today, I get the stream, but there 
seams to be no audio signal on it... By the way, probably you should try

http://131.243.160.26:3389/listen

(no extension) which connects you directly to the audio stream, the m3u 
is a playlist pointing to the stream.

Folks be aware that the ip address is not the same anymore as it was 
yesterday, so all those having added a book-mark - get rid of it.

Cheers, Lars.

Yesterday even after they increased the limit and others were able to hear, I still could  not.
I was able to ping the IP however...

What is the meaning of these warnings - I would be surprised if the link 
advertized by "(...) to protect yourself, please go here:" would not be 
resolved to an IP address... Is it possible to switch these off?

> Yesterday even after they increased the limit and others were able to

A good check is to request the file by http (which is the transport 
protocol used). So if you get a text file names listen.m3u, everything 
is fine. If you have a firewall blocking outgoing (!) port 3389, that 
would not make much sense and should be safe to be disabled.

Another question is whether your client is able to handle the m3u 
playlist or prefers to get directly pointed to the stream.

I have no idea why the setup was changed after yesterday, but obviously 
now we have a configuration sending out data that cannot be used. I 
receive a stream, but any client I point at it gives up with protocol 
errors. E.g. VLC, which is usually very tolerant, gives me

(...)
main debug: Buffering 97%
main debug: Stream buffering done (1201 ms in 853 ms)
main debug: Decoder buffering done in 0 ms
main warning: PTS is out of range (-9924), dropping buffer
main warning: PTS is out of range (-36010), dropping buffer
mpgatofixed32 debug: libmad error: bad main_data_begin pointer
mpgatofixed32 debug: libmad error: bad main_data_begin pointer

so I see little hope for us to get audio back.

Cheers, Lars.

I have to say, a lot of the heady BSDF stuff that was introduced last year was lost on me when I simply reviewed the slides from the '10 Workshop. So I can imagine for the '11 "remote attendees", having the webcast experience along with the slides is much closer to "being there". THanks to Andy and LBNL for hosting a great Workshop, and for all the tech support involved in getting the webcast going. 

I am so glad I was able to attend this year and I enjoyed seeing old and new faces; I always wish there was more time. Sorry I had to exit stage right before the whole show was over but I barely made my plane as it was! 

I hope Chris R. and Joe D. and anyone else trying to head toward that beast Irene makes out as well as they can. 

Until next time, happy rendering!

- Rob G.

Yes, thanks to all who attended, all who presented, and especially all who helped organize this year's workshop.  As well as Andy, Dane Lay and Daniel Fuller were hard at work behind the scenes, and we must thank Christian Kohler again for figuring out how to do the webcast and taking care of many of the details (in real time no less).

Thanks also to the workshop sponsors, and to Eleanor Lee and Stephen Selkowitz for their support and extensive participation, and to Francis Rubinstein who got the whole thing started with Radiance way back when, taking part this year as well.

I do hope people's travel home is not delayed too badly, and that Irene has mercy on our friends on the East Coast.

We posted the Gigapan taken of the workshop participants at:

	http://gigapan.org/gigapans/85282/

Assuming the link works, you can put some names to faces -- at least for the people who remembered their name tags.

How valuable would it be to attempt to record people's presentations next year -- audio + advance sequence?  I think both PowerPoint and Keynote support this feature, though I haven't really played around with it.  Maybe not as exciting as a webcast, but a little more archival.

Best,
-Greg

Subject: [Radiance-general] glare analysis
Message-ID: <CAL121Wyk_b0N4KXAKJOrXAQvqs7+okApB8KgDgO+LQ4kXS-EEA@mail.gmail.com>

hello folks.

i have files (fish eye rendered images) of my project. im doing glare
analysis using Evalglare program and following the tutorial by Shelby Doyle
and Christoph Reinhart in a step by step manner.

the mistake what i have done is:  i have rendered all the images in
hemispherical view (vth) and the evalglare program takes only vta i.e
angular.

it took long to render those images around 150 files. this means i have to
render everyhting again by changing the the view type to angular and render.

my doubt is is there any other method where i can get the glare analysis
done with the hemispehrical view itself which is also 180degree fish eye.
this will save my time.

thanks alot.
will be really helpful if i get the solution

thanks
regards
dhaRam

Hi Dharam,

I guess you would be able to implement a reprojection for the images, 
either using Radiance's tools or any other software. You could e.g. 
start with vwrays -vta (...), which would give you for each pixel of 
your required -vta-projection the corresponding vectors. Using rcalc, 
you could calculate backwards at which pixel-coordinates in a 
vth-projected image of given dimensions the pixel-value for this 
direction is found. The problem is that there will be some interpolation 
needed in the process. I am not sure whether this will be faster then 
re-rendering the images. Did you keep all the files for the renderings, 
especially the ambient data? Depending on how you did the renderings, 
doing a second run with only changed view-parameters, but existing 
ambient cache data could be very quick.

Cheers, Lars.

I agree with Lars. I would rather re-render the images. 

Too bad that I missed the Radiance workshop. I was in Germany celebrating my Grandpa's 95th birthday.

Actually, you should be able to reproject the pixels using pinterp.  Try the following:

	pinterp -vf rend_vth.hdr -x orig_xres -y orig_yres -vta rend_vth.hdr 1.0 > rend_vta.hdr

Greg, I had NO clue that pinterp can be used as a tool for reprojection, 
even though I just found it is all written in the manpage. For me, it 
was always an animation tool to interpolate in between frames.

Great!!!

good evening sir.

actually im using "*.pic*" files .. i guess instead of .hdr i can replace it
with .pic   .....am i rite sir? or will it make a difference

and i did this and an error message is displayed "read error"

can u guide me sir.

[i went through the userman and there is a command for changing angular to
hemispherical fish eye and i need the other way round. :) ]

'pinterp -vf fish.hdr -vth -ff fish.hdr 1 > hemi.hdr'

thank you sir

Hi dhaRam!

In old times, we used .pic (picture) as a file extension in Radiance. 
This however caused some confusion, as there are a lot of differen 
formats using the same extension. So some years ago, folks started to 
name Radiance "image" data files .hdr (high dynamic range). This is also 
officially registred as a mime-type now, and in general is preferred. 
However Radiance does not really care about the name of your files.

So if your vht-projected image is in file fish.pic and you want to keep 
the old naming, just adopt the command line accordingly.

> 'pinterp -vf fish.hdr -vth -ff fish.hdr 1 > hemi.hdr'

will thus become

pinterp -vf fish.pic -vth -ff fish.pic 1 > hemi.pic

BUT: If you have a closer look at Greg's mail, you will find that you do 
something quite different, and I do not really know why. Why do you use 
other parameters then Greg proposed?

Cheers, Lars.

hello sir.

that was exactly i was confused about. in Greg's mail he mentioned about x
res and y res ..... so i was confused with that and hence again mailed back.

the method given is angular to hemispherical ......and i need the other way
round.......so if i use the same command by just replacing fish (angular)
with hemispherical wil the commnad be same .... ( im supposing no) ... pls
let me kno about it sir...

thank you..

p.s- -  as im exploring radiance more and more its getting interesting....
and i want to thank you for it sir....

thanks..

Hi dhaRam,

Your initial e-mail said you had -vth images and needed -vta, so that's the way I wrote the pinterp command, giving the original view first, then updating it with '-vta'.  The -x and -y resolution options are needed because pinterp otherwise defaults to 512x512, and you may not want that.  The default filling option ('-fa') should work fine in your case, which is why I didn't specify anything for -f.  Using '-ff' may result in some black pixels, which you don't want to send to evalglare as it would skew your results.

A little experimentation should resolve any outstanding issues.

Best,
-Greg
