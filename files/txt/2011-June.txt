Hi All,

Just a heads up that the website (along with a few other websites including radsite at the lab - including radsite) will be down tomorrow (Sat 4-June-2011) from 12 to 14 hours starting at 6am PST / 2pm UTC.

Granted everything goes well the site will be back up after that period.

Thanks for your patience.

Message-ID: <4DED418B.3070601@gmail.com>

Dear all,

Some of you will already have found out that there have been some
updates to the (temporary) 2010 Workshop page. It is available from the
link below, which also provides a mirror for all previous workshop
presentations

http://www.jaloxa.eu/mirrors/radiance_workshops/index.shtml

There have been some last-minute changes to the schedule, so if you spot 
any inconsistencies, or have anything to add, please get in touch with me.

Once everybody is reasonably happy with the page, it will be mirrored to 
LBNL and Fraunhofer (who are experiencing some problem with their
content management system).

Cheers

Axel

Subject: [Radiance-general] Odd values when using gensky and ambient
	accuracy is zero...
Message-ID: <4DEF4B1B.60406@st-andrews.ac.uk>

Hi Everyone,

Please excuse me if this question has come up before (or if it's simply 
a dumb question). I'm using mingw radiance with a matlab wrapper to make 
stereo stimuli for perceptual experiments. Up until now my illumination 
has been made by specifying a hemifield of small lights. I'm beginning 
to prepare an experiment which will involve the creation of a larger 
number of images, hence I'm trying to speed up my rendering. One option 
seems to be to use gensky to specify a more natural illumination field, 
this seems to halve my rendering times.

However, I only get satisfactory reproduction of the shadows when I use 
low values of ambient accuracy (not surprising). Shadows created with 
non zero ambient accuracy seem to be interpolated to a certain extent. 
Because my rendered images form a stereo pair, the differences between 
the shadows become very noticeable as irregularities in the surface 
depth, rather than as changes in brightness, this is a problem. I get 
much better rendering of the shadows when I  specify an 'aa' value of 
zero. But when I do this the reflectances seem to get messed up. The 
attached images include a series of monochrome tiles towards the bottom, 
these are linearly spaced in reflectance from 0.2 to 0.8. However for 
the gensky rendered image with aa set to 0 the darkest tile seems too 
dark. This jump in radiance disappears when I increase aa to 0.1, it 
also disappears when I change to multiple spherical lights and leave aa 
at zero.

Some example images:

http://i1235.photobucket.com/albums/ff431/GeorgeLovell/RadianceProblems/SkyType_sphere200Lights_aa_000_ar_0256.png

   - Things seem fine, though the rendering takes 780 seconds


http://i1235.photobucket.com/albums/ff431/GeorgeLovell/RadianceProblems/SkyType_gensky_aa_010_ar_0256.png

    - Rendering is quicker with gensky but with an aa value of .1 there 
are problems with the shadows.


http://i1235.photobucket.com/albums/ff431/GeorgeLovell/RadianceProblems/SkyType_gensky_aa_000_ar_0256.png

    - Here the darkest tile along the bottom of the image is too dark.

----
For reference: the leftmost and middle images form a cross-fuseable 
stereo pair, i.e. you cross your eyes when you look at them left eye 
looks at the middle image and the right eye looks at the leftmost image 
(this can give you a headache!). The rightmost image can be viewed using 
red/green glasses.
----

Does anyone have a clue why setting aa to zero seems to change the 
brightness of the darkest tile?

Thanks,

George

Hi George,

This is an intelligent and well-written question.  Thank you for taking the time to construct such a nice posting.

Setting -aa 0 makes the calculation very sensitive to settings of -lw and -lr.  You should make sure that -lr is negative to enable Russian roulette sampling -- try "-lr -8" for starters.  If this doesn't fix the problem, try reducing the -lw parameter setting by powers of 10 until the discrepancy goes away or become acceptable.

Best of luck,
-Greg

P.S.  You may find my 2005 presentation on new Radiance features illustrative:

Hello,
I have been reading all the posts concerning problems with the function file
"rayinit.cal"
So Accordingly to that I did some of the stuff *i read. I went to the
control panel/advance/ environmental settings, and in the path and raypath i
did the changes needed in order for the system to find the rayinit file.
Even though i did all this when i run radiance from ecotect the same fatal
error is appearing: cannot find function file "rayinit.cal".*
*
*
*this is how i have it*
*path:
 %SystemRoot%\system32;%SystemRoot%;%SystemRoot%\System32\Wbem;C:\hp\bin\Python;C:\Program
Files (x86)\Autodesk\Backburner\;C:\Program Files\Common Files\Autodesk
Shared\;C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Autodesk
Shared\;%SYSTEMROOT%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\;C:\Radiance\lib
*

raypath:    .;C:\Radiance\lib

I cannot see which is the problem since I think the right direction is shown
in both path and raypath, what should I do? I have windows vista.

I apreciate any help I can have since I am doing my thesis and i want to set
illuminance values for several spaces in a project. Cheers

Is your spelling of "path" and "raypath" accidentally lowercase? The name of
the environment variable should be "RAYPATH" (all uppercase).

thanks for the answer, I had raypath all in uppercase as you mentioned it
should be. but path was in lowercase. I changed it to uppercase and I try to
run again the calculation, still appearing the same fatal error. I dont know
what to do....thanks a lot!

Hugo,
At the risk of being too obvious: did you check the actual presence of the 
file in the /lib directory? I recall having this issue as well on a windows 
machine. Some distributions seem to miss this specific file.

 I have to admit at the begining I didn?t check that but I did it after and
the file is in the lib library as it should be. I am double cheking now and
the file is there.

I suppose you have to hit the command line then:

Open a command prompt and type

set RAYPATH

If your setting is still active you should see the path displayed. I you
still have it check that the script created by Ecotect doesn't set the path
again. Finally you can try to copy the rayinit.cal file into your project
directory and run the command again.

Subject: [Radiance-general] pvalue related question
Message-ID: <BANLkTimkBFFoH__JP=BVTUoRVPcRvdOz1g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello list, I am trying to find lux levels from an image created with
radiance.

I believe that I have made a mistake on the parameters because the values I
read are mostly bellow 1 (lux???)

Rendering the image I can see that lux levels are much higher, up to 100
lux.

The parameters I am using with pvalue are the following:

"pvalue -h -o -b"

Any suggestions, cause I feel somehow lost???

Thanks in advance

Radiance images store radiance values. You have to convert the raw values
with the appropriate luminous efficacy value (179 by default). This only
makes sense if the image was rendered with "-i" as an option to rpict and
has not been passed through pcond.

Solution: add rcalc to your command

pvalue -h -H -b -o image.hdr | rcalc -e '$1=$1;$2=$2;$3=$3*179'

Thomas

Subject: [Radiance-general] how to use pfilt to perform anti-aliasing
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=8LO+mxrA4QAOQXiop3FQz3=X0PQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Radiance experts,

I use pfilt to treat a .hdr image generated by rpict command.

However, the the pfilt doesn't seem to have any impact in terms of
anti-aliasing of the image.

The pfilt command I used is:
pfilt -x 1024 -y 1024 -e 1 -r 0.55 ./direct_sunlight.hdr > test.hdr

the original .hdr image (saved as png file) is:
http://i1143.photobucket.com/albums/n633/oatcracker/Radiance/direct_sunlight.png

the output .hdr of the pfilt (saved as png file) is:
http://i1143.photobucket.com/albums/n633/oatcracker/Radiance/output_of_pfilt.png


Can you kindly tell me if I'm using pfilt correctly to perform
anti-aliasing?

Thanks!
Ji

Hi

To perform anti-aliasing you need to reduce your final image size (typically by a factor 3).
Hence your pfilt comand should be:

pfilt -x /3 -y /3 -e 1 -r 0.55 ./direct_sunlight.hdr > test.hdr

Dear Raphael,

Thanks for your prompt reply and advice!

Does this mean that I may need to bear in mind that the size of the image to
be produced by rpict should always be 3 times bigger than the size of the
final image I want?

Cheers, Ji

Yes. You can call it oversampling. See Mark's pages:

The "rad" program (or "trad" if it works) takes care of these details for you.

Why do you have three times 800 here? Looks like the third one gets 
interpreted as pixel aspect (-pa), which leads to the weird result that 
pfilt tries to downsample from a resolution of 2400x2400px to 800x1px.

Try

RESOLUTION= 800 800

Cheers, Lars.

Dear Radiance experts,

Two more questions about rad:

One of the options of the rad program is explained in the rad menu as:

[ *-n|-N* *npr* ]


1. Does this mean the "-n" and "-N npr" options are mutually exclusive?

2. Does "-N 3" mean the task to generate an .hdr image will be split
into 3 parallel rendering processes by Radiance behind the scene
regardless of the number of CPUs and number of "cores" within each CPU
of the computer?

Thanks!

Ji

Somehow - if you do not do any processing (-n), no processes can be 
started (-N npr)... somehow it is confusing, maybe separating the two in 
the manpage would be clearer. -n also affects all other options in the 
same way ;-)

> 2. Does"-N 3"  mean the task to generate an .hdr image will be split into 3 parallel rendering processes by Radiance behind the scene regardless of the number of CPUs and number of"cores"  within each CPU of the computer?

Radiance does not take your decisions. People on 4core-machines may have 
good reasons to render on two (and keep the remaining two cores busy 
with other tasks). So Radiance listens to you and will start as many 
render processes as you specify by -N 3.

Cheers, Lars.

Dear Lars,

Thanks for your prompt reply!

I've tried the "-N npr" option, and here's the error message i got when i
run "rad -N 6 ./test.rif" or "rad -N 4 ./test.rif" or "rad -N 2 ./test.rif":

rpiece: no NFS lock manager on this machine
rad: error rendering view 1

I don't know the meaning of the error message, and I found no information by
searching the email list.


However, It seems I can get rad up and running by using "rad -N 1
./test.rif" or just "rad ./test.rif".

I'm using a PC with Inter Core i7 CPU (8 cores, I guess based on what I see
on the task manager... )

So, can you kindly advice me on:
1. why the "-N 6" cann't be accepted when I want to utilize 6 of the 8 cores
of my CPU to speed up the rendering?
2. dose the npr means "number of processors/CPU" rather than "number of
cores within each CPU"?
3. how to specify rad options to harness multi-core CPU's capability?

Thanks!

Ji

I do not know about the locking capabilities in Windows. Anyone out here 
having experience with rpiece on Windows 7?

What is happening is that rad starts render processes. As these are 
supposed to share the ambient data (ambfile) to speed up the work, there 
must be a mechanism doing the coordination work on accessing this file. 
This is done using file lock (basically you need to make sure that one 
process does not write data while another is reading, but waits for the 
read to complete).

Cheers, Lars.

Dear Ji Zhang and Lars,*

*Windows (whatever the version 7, Vista, XP) doesn't have a NFS lock
manager. (So rpiece will NOT work).*
*Maybe one has been written for Cygwin, but I doubt it.

If you want to use Radiance on multiple core's your best option is MAC OS or
Unix/Linux (Ubuntu seems to be user friendly).

Another option would be to install Interix/SUA/SFU (Windows services for
Unix) on Windows 7 (or Vista or XP). And compile Radiance from source.
I don't think anyone has tried to compile Radiance using SFU, so no
guarantees here.*
*
I hope this helps,

Guy*

Hi!

Sure, that is the preferred way. However, I would consider how much 
rendering work you expect. If it justifies setting up a dedicated 
machine - do it unix-like. If it is not that much rendering time, you 
are still free to

a) wait and have rad sequentially render images using one core

b) split your renderings and manually start processes - as long as they 
do not need to share data, you do not need locking

Cheers, Lars.

another option is vmware with a linux image.

but my vote, preference, soul (and pocket) goes the Mac OS X way...
I would not be using radiance without a mac.

Amen, Giugi!! OSX was a game changer for me in terms of Radiance usability.

The thread is veering off topic, but I can't resist chiming in...

I'm not sure that OSX has any true advantage over Ubuntu or maybe another modern user friendly linux distribution purely for Radiance usage. The only advantage I see to OSX over linux is that it's more popular, so you'll see more frequent pre-compiled binaries floating around - for Radiance itself and any tools that users develop. On the other hand, linux has a strong advantage in terms of lower barrier to entry - it is cheaper to buy/inherit any old desktop box and install Ubuntu on it than to get a hold of a top notch Mac machine. It is even quite possible to set up an existing Windows machine to dual-boot into Ubuntu as necessary. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot

Windows implementation has the lowest barrier to entry in most cases, but shortfalls such as no file locking, X11 support, friendliness for programming/scripting, etc. On the other hand some common modeling tools such as Autodesk products are Windows native - so could avoid additional machines.

Chris is right, we're veering, so new subject line.

Chris, when I got my first OSX system (2002), the difference between OSX
10.1 and any Linux distro at the time was vast; there simply was no
comparison. I mean, really. No comparison, if we're talking barriers to
entry for Radiance. Today, I would say Ubuntu is pretty close to MacOS,
but still not quite as polished as MacOS. I use Snow Leopard, and then I
have WinXP, Win7, Ubuntu 11.04 VMs available on VMWare Fusion. So far I'm
still willing to pay the Apple tax on my hardware every few years or so.

I think it depends on what you want to do. If you want to integrate e.g. 
with some architectural CAD, Mac has a lot of software that you will not 
find in Linux world. If you start scripting, coupling Radiance into 
other tools (e.g. combining it with visualization software), go into 
heavy rendering - Linux will be the way to do so without pain. So back 
in 2002, I was a proud user of a Powerbook, and I had Radiance installed 
on it. However, I was suffering that I could not get some nice tools 
working (opendx, comfortable gnuplot, useable latex-environment). And 
heavy rendering I did using a mosix-cluster with lots (!) of cores, 
something impossible on other platforms.

So I think it really depends on what your working conditions are. If you 
are doing enough numerical simulation to have a dedicated machine for it 
(something with a fast cpu, lots of memory, good cooling, but maybe no 
sound- and graphics card and probably not even a screen as it will be 
located far from your workdesk anyhow), that would probably be a highly 
optimized linux installation. Everything else would just make it 
complicated, and you would not want to have a CAD installtion on this. 
If you are running Radiance on your work desk - hey, it is 
multiplatform, so you can do so whatever os you use.

In this case, Mac users enjoy downloading and copying binaries provided 
by Greg into their path and adjusting some settings. Linux users are 
even luckier, they typically will just select Radiance and have all the 
installation done automatically by their package manager (at least for 
Debian and Ubuntu, Radiance is part of the distributions). Windows users 
will suffer, as they first need to choose a way to somehow emulate a 
unix-like environment (using e.g. cygwin). Still, it works for all of them.

Cheers, Lars.

Hi,

I am wondering if  there is a way to crop a .pic file generated using
rpict ? I would like to crop the .pic file so that it corresponds to
images with a 60 and 120 degree cone of vision to in order to
calculate luminance ratios for the task and surround area,
respectively. In other words, I was just thinking of cropping the 180
degree fisheye view to two smaller circles.

Thanks,

Hi Krystyna,

Can you share a few more details?  What were the exact view parameters you gave to rpict, and do you need to compute circular area averages or would rectangular areas work?

This can probably be done with pcomb without needing to crop the images, but some math is required.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Use Python to execute Radiance command
Message-ID: <BANLkTimYDcdBkFeLtttCjBSayb6bd4wSYg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Radiance experts,

Suppose you want to use Python to call rad command and render an image using
the following script:

################################
import os
rad_command = "rad -e -v vw1 /test.rif"
os.system(rad_command)
################################

Python will hang there until the rad command running in background is
finished. During this period, you can do nothing in the Python Shell...

So, is there a way to use Python to call the Terminal and "paste" the rad
command string into the Terminal and then run rad? In this way, Python is
freed from the rad rendering process once it's be activated in the Terminal.


Appreciate your advices!

(using Mac OS 10.6.7, Radiance 4, and Python 2.6.5)

Dear Radiancors,

May I ask how to specify the path and name of the .hdr file as generated by
rad when constructing rad command?

As far as I know, the options of rad such as PICTURE, RAWFILE, etc only
specify the "root name" of certain files generated in the process.

Thanks!

Can't you just add an ampersand ('&') to the end of your rad command to run it in the background?

You are correct.  There is no way to directly specify the exact output file name, which is constructed from the root name you give and the view name, separated by an underscore ('_') and followed by the ".hdr" suffix.  If you want a different name, you either have to run the rpict command yourself or, easier, rename the file after rad is done using "mv" or similar.

Hi Greg,

I am using DIVA for Rhino to do the renderings. It looks like the
rpict view parameters used in DIVA are the following:
-vta -vp 1275.98 31.928 229.686 -vd -17.783 -2.785 0 -vu 0 0 1 -vh 180
-vv 180 -vo 0 -va 0 -vs 0 -vl 0

DIVA outputs a pic file with a 180 degree fisheye view and I was
hoping that I could mask all but a 60 and 120 degree cone of vision
within the image so that I can calculate maximum and minimum pixel
values within these smaller views. Rectangular areas for calculating
averages would work.

Thank you,

Krystyna

Thanks, Krystyna -- this is helpful.

There are a few ways you could do this.  The easiest might be to use pinterp to convert the view angles and average over rectangles, but the more accurate way if you really want a cone angle is with pcomb, like so:

angle = 60
pcomb -e "fang:$angle/180" -e 'xc:xmax/2;yc:ymax/2' -e 'r2=((x-xc)*(x-xc)+(y-yc)*(y-yc))/(xc*yc)' \
	-e 'lo=if(r2-fang*fang,0,WE/(PI*fang*xc*fang*yc)*li(1))' -o render.hdr \
	| pvalue -h -H -pG -df | total -if

Then repeat with angle=120.  This command only works for angular fisheye images with 180 degrees in each dimension and square pixels (-vta -vh 180 -vv 180 -pa 1) which is what you have.  (The -pa 1 option is defaulted.)

The reported result will be in averaged cd/m^2 (nits).  If you want radiance units (watts/m^2) instead, take off the WE constant (=179) and substitute 1.0 in the final -e option to pcomb.

The command works by setting all pixels outside the desired cone to 0, and scaling the rest by one over the number of pixels inside the target radius.  The picture is converted to IEEE floats by pvalue and summed up by the total utility.

I did a quick test and it seems to work OK.

Best,
-Greg

Dear Greg, Thanks for you reply!

Actually, I was asking whether we can specify the directory where the .hdr
image generated by rad will be saved.

I just found out that it can be done, and the "root name" for the PICTURE
variable of rad can include the path where the image file will be placed
once it's generated.

e.g.
"PICTURE = /Volumes/ZJ_1TB/test/rad_image" will save the "rad_image_vw1.hdr"
file in the following place: "/Volumes/ZJ_1TB/test".

Anyway, thanks for the clarification!

- Ji

Thank you very much for your advice, Greg! It works.

May I ask whether specifying the '&' option for rad command to make it run
in background can be applied in similar way to other Radiance command such
as rpict, rtrace, etc to make them run in background as well?

Thanks again!

- Cheers, Ji

Hi Ji,

Yes, the ampersand can be used to send most any program to the background. This is a UNIX thing, not a Radiance thing. You may want to get familiar with the "top" program, so you can check on the status of your background jobs.

You can also have multiple terminal windows open, so you could have your processes running on the foreground and just start up another shell to do other stuff.

The "screen" program can also be useful for popping in and out of processes you have running (http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/).

Dear Radiance experts,

Suppose you want to use Python to call rad command and render an image using the following script:

################################
import os
rad_command = "rad -e -v vw1 /test.rif"
os.system(rad_command)
################################

Python will hang there until the rad command running in background is finished. During this period, you can do nothing in the Python Shell...

So, is there a way to use Python to call the Terminal and "paste" the rad command string into the Terminal and then run rad? In this way, Python is freed from the rad rendering process once it's be activated in the Terminal.

Appreciate your advices!

(using Mac OS 10.6.7, Radiance 4, and Python 2.6.5)

Ji

The "&" is a standard Unix shell control character and as such can be
applied to any process, not only those related to Radiance.

Sometimes it is tricky to find the right place for it, though, especially if
you have multiple redirections in your command line. You should always test
your commands manually before you use them in a Python "os.system()" call.

Note 1: If you use the return value of the os.system() call to check if the
command was successful you will get a "0" (=success) if the command with "&"
was started successfully, not if it actually run without errors.

Note 2: "os.system()" was replaced by "Popen()" in the "subprocess" module.

Note 3: If you use your Python script only to automate a simple sequence of
tasks you should be fine with using rad directly in the script. For more
control over the processes and their success/failure you should use the
underlying programs "oconv", "rpict", "pfilt" etc. directly. Unfortunately
the project to write a nice little Python wrapper library for Radiance
didn't really get of the ground ...

Regards,
Thomas

Dear Thomas and Robert,

Thank you very much for your prompt advice! Seems I need to bear in mind
that Radiance is developed in UNIX environment initially and a lot of UNIX
conventions can be utilized.

As to Thomas comments on Python wrapper library for Radiance, I think my
colleague Dr Patrick Janssen is exploring on that direction by testing it on
a procedure modeling software platform called Houdini (www.sidefx.com).

Actually, most of the questions I post here were derived in the learning
process of connecting Houdini and Radiance (as well as other building
performance simulation software) via the Python interface built into
Houdini.

Some of the work-in-progress can be found in Dr Janssen's teaching website:
http://patrickjanssenstudio.blogspot.com/

- Cheers, Ji

I would advice to spend a week-end on unix useage. It is the base of 
what can be done on any Linux/BSD/Solaris/Mac OS system these days, and 
has been for the last 30 years, which is due to its rather generic 
conceptual nature. Working with processes, inputs and outputs, 
redirection, filters, is all very useful here and works on all 
unix-based platforms.

Cool, thank you for sharing the link. Are you also going to use 
simulation results as input for modeling, such as design optimization? 
Maybe there will be some work shared on a coming Radiance workshop? Say 
hello to SDE folks, Shinya is references on the blog, too :-)

Cheers, Lars.

Hi, Lars, Thanks a lot for your advice!

Yes, Dr Janssen is guiding us in a research project in which we try to
examine the environmental performance (view, daylight, insolation, energy
consumption, etc) of various high density building forms.

Houdini is used as a parametric modeling platform to create 3D models. But
it's strong customizability allows us to define our own toolset to perform
specific types of simulation tasks. Basically, these tools 1) retrieve the
3D model information and pass it to simulation software (e.g. Radiance,
EnergyPlus), 2) activate simulation software and feed in the parameters
required by the software, 3) retrieve the simulation results and bring the
date generated back to the 3D model for visualization and other analysis
purpose. So, Python is like a "glue" in this process that connects
parametric modeling software and simulation software, and Houdini is the
platform where we built tools and control panels to manipulate forms and
simulation processes. Radiance is used to simulate Sky View Factor, Daylight
Factor, and facade insolation. We're still working on key performance
indicators and benchmark values to be used to compare across cases, and
these indicators and benchmark values might be used to drive the design
optimization process.

Actually, Patrick will demo this workflow in a workshop in the upcoming CAAD
Future 2011 conference next month:
http://www.lucid.ulg.ac.be/conferences/caadfutures2011/Workshop3.html

Yes, Lars, I think you nurtured fans here in SDE, e.g. Daniel, who still
talks about your expertise in Radiance quite often. hehe.

- Cheers, Ji

Interesting discussion! Would love to see the Houdini2Radiance
 pipeline in the workshop, but i don't think i'll be in Liege. 
Some time ago i had a strong wish of having a Python wrapper for 
Radiance, but i could not find any, and i found the project to 
overwhelming to just start myself. Besides that i use Python 
merely for everyday scripting with 3d, so skillfully designing 
modules is a different cup of tea. Is there any fragment of a 
project like that around that i might have missed?

Late last year we had a discussion about a joint effort to produce something
like that. It didn't go very far, though. You can find posts in a Google
group dedicated to it here:

http://groups.google.com/group/python-radiance?lnk=srg

The consens was to focus on a light wrapper around the Radiance binaires and
not go into writing a proper C extension module. Python is mostly used as a
glue and control language and so full integration of Radiance is hardly
necessary.

I'm sure there are already a few implementations of a Radiance module
around, each written for a particular purpose. It would be nice if the
individual authors could contribute their parts and we could start
assembling a "reference" module.

Thomas

Hi,

Great idea! I like it!

I found this Python package of Andreas Gerber:
http://www.hochschule-biberach.de/sections/forschung/ige/radview
It has a rpm package for Linux.

For Windows you will need these:
Unofficial Windows Binaries for Python Extension Packages
http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/

And for Windows it has a few issues and some Python calls need to be
updated/modified.

Best Regards,

Guy

Nice idea. Started one of those (scene viewer) with wxPython instead of Qt.

However, the Python module should provide more basic access to Radiance
files and programs. For example it could provide a scene file parser which
could be used in a viewer.

Speaking of scene viewers, we are very close to wrapping up a Radiance cross platform build environment on cmake that includes a scene viewer built with Qt, that works on all platforms, including Windows. We are building up an initial unit test suite for the core applications and hope to have something to show Greg soon. Ideally it would be integrated with the Radiance source tree, but it can stand alone as well, doing nightly HEAD pulls from the Radiance CVS server. 

This is coming RSN (real soon now), I hope.

It might be possible to get full Radiance going under Windows 7 
Ultimate, which has a Unix emulation environment.  However, doing this 
requires development time and the purchase of a copy of Ultimate and 
possibly a copy of the MS Visual Studio suite as well.  To run the 
resulting package might also require users to buy Ultimate.

So...one more thing we might try, if we had the resources and if there 
were enough interest.

Hi Randolph,

Great thinking! I like the idea already!

But could you give a bit more information?

> It might be possible to get full Radiance going under Windows 7
> Ultimate, which has a Unix emulation environment.

Are you referring to SFU (Windows Services for Unix, or SUA or Interix, or
how its called now)?
SFU has an (old) gcc compiler. (See: http://suacommunity.com/SUA.aspx)
(other tools are in the warehouse or developer packages).

Why would you need MSVC? As far as I know MSVC only compiles win32 (or
win64) code, so no Unix, no fork and no NSF.

Oh, and one more thing, if it is SFU you are referring to, then it is also
available for Vista, (and XP with an hack).

Regards,

Guy

It would have to be tried, of course.  That's why I say we would need 
resources for it.

That's a really useful link.  In any event, there's a new version of 
the SUA in Windows 7.  MS claims support for fork()/exec() and 
fcntl()/F_SETLKW.  If these claims for compatibility (and some others) 
are valid, full Radiance will operate in the Windows 7/Windows Server 
2008 SUA.  (See 
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc772343.aspx)

MS says that MSVC can be used with the SUA, though perhaps is not 
necessary...or perhaps it is.  It would be very hard to get gcc 
problems fixed in that environment.
