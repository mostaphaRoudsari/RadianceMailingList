Hi Tim,

polycarbonate spectral transmittance or BSDF (distribution of scattered light) 
data or model of polycarbonate double-walled extruded sheets, like "Lexan 
Thermoclear" ?

For the latter, how accurate you want to model the typical glare "ring" ? Just 
its position (relatively simple cal file) or a complete model for a specific 
material ?

best
Peter

Peter is trying to find out the level of detail (and thus the depth of
information on the optical properties and its model) you will need. What
is your application?

Are you looking at solid, structured, hollow samples?

Cheers, Lars.

Hi, 

Wondering if anyone else is using Satel-light data with gendaylit. I seem to only be able to get direct horizontal irradiance (Ees, according to the glossary) rather than direct normal irradiance (Eesn) from the Satel-light database. 

Can I just divide the direct horizontal irradiance by cos(altitude) to get the direct normal irradiance? Is that valid?

John Ford.

Hi john,

you find the answer directly in the gendaylit man page or just by typing
gendaylit, you just have to use the -G option - see below.

Message-ID: <201111061853.pA6Ir52h007826@mta2.lbl.gov>

Hi Tim,

Seems a good answer to your question depends a bit on hearing some more 
details on your material.
There are quite a few degrees of freedom left for the answer:

Polycarbonate itself is quite close to be ideal transparent, - and 
therefore used for many optically clear and mechanically robust 
applications from CD/DVD discs to aircraft windows. A polycarbonate 
single pane (straight out of manufacturing, no dirt, no scratches) would 
be best described by Radiance "glass".

When used in double-walled extrusion panes (product name LEXAN and 
others, which actually may have more than two internal walls for 
structural reasons), the resulting light distribution is more complex 
than a straight-through scattered beam plus a reflected beam: Due to 
multiple internal reflections, the outgoing light is cone shaped. This 
may cause unpleasant glare, if material orientation, sun position and 
viewer are aligned "correctly" (and there's a good chance for that).
This light distribution is more complex than what "trans" can do. In 
Radiance, it requires either a traditional cal file with a functional 
model or the new BSDF material. The latter has the advantage that the 
illumination calc may be more efficient. If you just want to analyse the 
"correct" alignment between sun-material-viewer, the cal file is pretty 
simple. A more detailed and energy-correct model is a more complex. So 
far, so hoopy, that's the situation for the *clear* standard material.

However, during the extrusion, Titaniumdioxid (TiO2 or anything else 
that is stable and scattering) may be added to the Polycarbonate base, 
leading to a varying degree of light scattering of the finished 
material. This may range from "a bit" of scattering to nearly opaque, 
depending on the amount of TiO_2 per volume.
With an increase of TiO2 , the light distribution is increasingly 
dominated by the scattering within the material. And the influence of 
the inter-reflections between the walls decrease and so does the 
cone-shaped, glare creating part of the outgoing light distribution. 
Depending on TiO2 amount and internal structure, the material is then 
mostly forward scattering, and can be described by "trans".

Btw, the TiO2 had been used to get the Sydney2000 stadium roof working 
without glare. The original plans with clear material would have created 
an unpleasant glare for folks in many rows.

So, the way in Radiance depends on your specific extrusion profile and 
material, plus your intended use.

best regards
Peter

Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance 4.1 official release
Message-ID: <4B2B9DE0-95D4-487D-93EB-EB94E98DC866@gmail.com>

I have uploaded the official 4.1 release of the Radiance source, together with binaries for Mac OS X:

	http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/download.html

Unfortunately, I haven't figured out what I need to do for the radiance-online.org site, so that's stuck on 4.0 for the moment, though the HEAD is the same thing as 4.1 until it gets updated.

There have been a number of important features added in this release, excerpted from the release notes:

Modified dctimestep to accept sky vector and daylight coefficient matrix
or list of images to sum together, as suggested by Andy McNeil.

Created genBSDF script to generate BSDF in Windows XML format.

Added ability for rsensor to output ray origins and directions
rather than actually loading octree and computing sensor value.

Updated reflection model according to EGSR 2010 paper by David
Geisler-Moroder and Arne Duer.

Replaced C-shell version of falsecolor with Perl script written
by Axel Jacobs.

****** COMPATIBILITY CHANGE ********
Changed -sj (specular jitter) option to something called specular
sampling (-ss), which if set less than 1 has the same behavior as
the old -sj, but when set greater than 1, spawns multiple ray
samples from semi-specular surfaces.

Added BSDF data-driven material type with full sampling support.

Added BRDF calculations to genBSDF.

Added variable-resolution BSDF support in renderers and genBSDF.

Created pkgBSDF program to extract BSDF geometry and put it
together with surface description suitable for inclusion in
a Radiance scene.

Muted warning for "no light sources found" when there is at least
one glow object and interreflections are on (-ab > 0).

Checked in cross-platform cmake build system created by Bill Hoffman
of KitWare and sponsored by NREL.  This includes a qt-based
driver for rvu, which is built in the new subdirectory src/qtrvu.

Message-ID: <6B2919014FFF0D49A0F961B3CFCDAAEA0670CB@ENTWEXMB0000005.university.harvard.edu>

Dear Building Simulation 2011 attendee (or Sydney resident),


DIVA is a Radiance/Daysim/EnergyPlus plug-in that we have developed for the Rhinoceros/Grasshopper - NURBS modeler for Windows. DIVA supports a series of performance evaluations including:



- Physically-based scene visualizations (Radiance)

- Annual radiation maps (Radiance/GenCumulativeSky)

- Climate-based daylighting metrics (Daysim)

- Glare analysis (Evalglare)

- LEED IEQ Credit 8.1 compliance (Radiance)

- Hourly load calculations (EnergyPlus)



The plug-in offers highly optimized simulation workflows within Rhino and can be combined with parametric Grasshopper scripting in order to generate animated simulation movies (see for example http://vimeo.com/31269386). More information can be found at www.diva-for-rhino.com<http://www.diva-for-rhino.com> and http://wiki.diva-for-rhino.com/HomePage.

Greetings simulationists,

I am pleased to announce that the first two demonstration videos featuring
the Radiance integration with OpenStudio have been posted on the
OpenStudio YouTube page.

This one demonstrates ModelToRad.rb, a translator for OpenStudio models to
Radiance format:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mfz0ULTK8eQ

This one demos DaylightSim.rb, which allows you perform some basic
daylighting calculations:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeeLN-KU6-c

Support for more materials (trans, BSDF), the three phase daylight
coefficient method, and schedule import/export are in the works.

The Radiance Dashboard, promised at the Radiance Workshop on August, is
also close to going live; I'll post an announcement here when that happens.

Plenty of other information about the OpenStudio project can be found at
(openstudio.nrel.gov).

Message-ID: <CAAZQWqggh69W5YtXXZQG4MuQQy3tV6Bavj_d_sBSYZ8VEs9Rwg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to model one complex blinds' lamelas in Radiance.
I have lamela model in SketchUp but when exported to Radiance it gives 70
surfaces per one lamela - which is too much for simulations.

So I have an idea to try to model surface with gensurf, but no idea how
exactly.

Since I have SketchUP export I can extract data about sruface points so it
is some array of (x,y,z) coordinates:
(x1, y1,z1), (x2,y2,z2)...(xn,yn,zn).
Points in x and z aren't equidistant, while y={0,1}.

Problem is how to use these values in gensurf.
I want to have surface composed of multiple surfaces in x direction and 1
surface in y direction (length of a lamela)

I suppose appropriate command format would be:
*gensurf mat name dfile dfile dfile m n *

What is the format of dat files I need here? I tried to understand
something from manpage but no sucess.

Is this the right way to model complex blind lamela (it has few curvatures
and w shape etc.)?

Thanks in advance,
Marija

My impression is that this will get quite complicated. gensurf would
still need the coordinates to come in the right ordering, and I do not
know how you could achieve that when exporting from Sketchup. Without
that, gensurf does not know which vertex locations to combine into one
surface. Also, you would again get lots of surfaces, as gensurf would
create flat surfaces between the vertex locations.

Two alternatives:

a) If you exactly know the profile of your lamellas, you could use a
functional description instead. This would still lead to quite a lot of
surfaces for each, but probably less. And (most important) you would
have great control on the resolution of the facetting. This would e.g.
make it possible to find out at what resolution you see no effect on
your results any more.

b) If you need to rely on your exported Sketchup model, I would advice
looking into instances or the mesh object. Create a "short" lamella,
something like one unit length, and export it. Make it a frozen instance
(using oconv -f) or a mesh object (using obj2mesh). Create a small scene
file containing only the mesh or instance primitive for this compiled
geometry. Than build your blinds from this element using an xform array
in your scene file. This will lead to very little memory consumption for
these objects.

If your shading systems consists of lots of blinds, I would even
consider using instances when creating geometry using gensurf (case a).
However in typical scenes, you do not reach critical polygon counts yet.
Radiance is very good in handling lots of surfaces, unless memory gets
used up.

Cheers, Lars.

>  I am using structures panels, the application is 40mm thick Wall panels

Hi Tim,

40mm probably means hollow, not solid panels. The internal structure
would lead to transmission and reflection distributions which, depending
on your application, are probably not sufficiently described by trans
(which allows only one transmissive and one reflective peak), prism or
prism2. It would also be a good idea to know about the actual
performance of these panels, which requires measurements (Peter is
running one of those labs able to do such measurements, others are at
LBNL and SERIS). The topic BSDF has been discussed in detail on the
recent Radiance workshops, with the presentations available on the
Radiance websites. Peter already replied to your initial message, and he
is probably one of the most experienced when it comes to the
characterization of the transmissive characteristics of such panels.

Cheers, Lars.

Thanks for answers,

After detailed analysis of lamellas' SKetchUp geometry, I decided to
simplify it a little bit - so I replaced curved parts with really small
radius with 2 polygons.
When exported number of surfaces per lamella is much smaller, and I still
get correct reflectances and overall blind transmittance, so I think this
simplified lamella geometry will work.

Since I need in building lots of blinds, so I'll surely use instances and
xform to put it all in building.

CU,
Marija.

Marija,

Have you considered using genblinds? This may simplify things a bit and give 
you more control over the number of surfaces. You could introduce an object 
in Sketchup and substitute is afterwards manually or by using instances.
good luck,
Casper

Hi Casper,

These blinds have complex geometry - each lamella has multiple curves (for
light redirection), so genblinds is not useful here.

I've been asked for more specifics, so if there is time (hah!) I will
probably do some performance testing.

Hi Rob:

I try your programs under Win 7.I downloaded the Window version of Radiance
4.0 from OpenStudio NREL website. Some programs written in perl such as
genskyvec are not included in the Radiance bin folder. I am
not familiar with Perl and Ruby.If I want to run it under Window OS, where
can I get these missing bin file?  or how can I compile the Radiance source

Hi Jia,

Yes, the Windows binary distribution is not quite finalized. I am working
with our staff here to get all those last Perl scripts included in the
binary distribution. We are also in the process of getting access to the
Radiance source tree so we can automate the updates; when that is set up,
we will share those links with the community. In the meantime I can send
you falsecolor and genskyvec tomorrow.

Thanks for your patience, we're trying to get this all wrapped here
shortly.

There may be some issues with Perl scripts and Windows.  I don't think genBSDF will work in its current configuration.  Andy McNeil and I fixed genklemsamp and genskyvec, and I think Axel's falsecolor script works, so it may just be genBSDF that needs an update.

Right; thanks for pointing that out Greg. I thought genskyvec and genklemsamp have been working for a little while, and I know falsecolor works. Didn't know about genBSDF, thanks for the heads up.

I wonder if the same issues would happen with Ruby? Hate to reinvent the wheel but from an OpenStudio support perspective, we'd actually be eliminating one dependency (Perl) but I get that most Radiance scripters are in Python land first and foremost, probably Perl second, and Ruby third (and then you have Andrew Marsh using Lua ;) ). Something for us to think about on this end, but I'd rather spend time wrapping Ian Ashdown's Perez sky generator first?

The Windows compatibility issues aren't really Perl-specific.  They are more associated with the Windows command line than anything else.  You can't pipe binary data between commands because Windows doesn't track the exact file length, nor can you escape newlines.  This changes how command lines are packaged up and handed off to the shell, and involves some inefficiencies if we do the same thing on all systems, which is why there are some ($windoz) conditionals in genklemsamp.

There is also the problem that Windows doesn't ship with Perl installed.  A windows user has to install one of the windows ports of Perl (Active Perl, Strawberry Perl, etc) or we could provide packaged executables for windows systems using par-packer (http://search.cpan.org/~rschupp/PAR-Packer-1.010/lib/pp.pm).  We've gone the par-packer route for the Radiance Perl programs needed by COMFEN and Window6 - we can't really tell those users to install a windows port of a unix utility, the user support requests would be a nightmare.

Subject: [Radiance-general] multiply pi to calculate illuminance?
Message-ID: <CABzgtwpCy0uMkWmpsi7cPcOz1RCpe=GMcs3O7JDATD1nYth3kw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello:

I notice the almost all the published literature use the following equation
to show the three phase daylight coefficient method.

i = VTDs
where:
i = result vector (luminances, *illuminance*s, image, etc.)
V = view matrix, relating outgoing directions on window to desired results
at interior
T = transmission matrix, relating incident window directions to exiting
directions (BSD
D = daylight matrix, relating sky patches to incident directions on window
s = sky vector, assigning* luminance* values to patches representing sky
directions.

I am curious that if "i" means "illuminance", is that  i = Pi*VTDs?

Thank you,

Jia

Hello Jia,

Good question.  The "i" does derive from "illuminance," but can be used for luminance values or pretty much anything derived from a lighting calculation, including something like "sensor voltage" for an lighting control system.  The "V" matrix includes the factor of pi (if necessary) and all other factors in the calculation of "i".  Thus, the equation need not change depending on the values you choose to compute.

I hope that's clear enough.

Best,
-Greg

Hi Galen,

I just checked to see if that login still works. It seems to be fine. 
Please try again, I know that the server is very picky about white 
space, so if you cut and paste the password it may not work, better to 
try typing it directly. If this does not work please send me an email 
directly and I will send the script via email.

Regards,

-Jack de Valpine

Subject: [Radiance-general] genBSDF questions
Message-ID: <CAAZQWqj95CAqkz3VYzzQ7kSaz-eQ_i8FqUR0gdN-QcVk2D1Uvg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,


I've been experimenting with genBSDF for some blinds simulation and
while working on it I've found out that some things aren't clear
enough to me :)

I understand that BSDF generated for a blind can be used for all
blinds with the same size in the building model.

Should genBSDF be repeated for different dimensions of blinds or
already calculated BSDF file can be reused?
For example if in a building I have windows with few different sizes,
should I recalculate BSDF for each window/blinds size

If blinds are similar to venetian blinds, is it ok if I use existing
BSDF for window with new height/width?

#######
Another question is if I have blinds composed of 2 or more types of
lamelas (for example one type of lamelas goes on the bottom part of
window, and another on top part). Should these blinds be treated as
one unit and calculated common BSDF for them; or separated and then
separate BSDF surfaces included in Radiance model?

#######
In BSDF material definition

mod BSDF id
6+ thick BSDFfile ux uy uz funcfile transform
0
0|3|6|9 rfdif gfdif bfdif rbdif gbdif bbdif rtdif gtdif btdif

"An optional 'transform' is used to scale the thickness and reorient
the up vector. " What does this exactly mean?

For example if input to genBSDF was defined in cm and my scene is in
m, which units should be used for thickness and what should be put as
transformation.


Hope my questions are clear enough :)

Thanks in advance,
Marija

If the blind behavior is close to uniform over its surface, i.e., the blind spacing and width is small relative to all of your windows, then you are probably OK with a single distribution on all your windows.  It's easy enough to run a comparison to be sure.

This brings up an important point regarding genBSDF, which is how you treat the edge conditions.  The best approach when you are trying to get the general behavior of something like venetian blinds is to create a system much larger than the area you actually sample with genBSDF, then use the "-dim" option to specify the region over which to sample.  This region should be an even multiple of the blind spacing, or whatever other repeating structures your system contains.

Another approach, which works for a system of a specific size that is fully contained within a rectangular window opening, is to model the edges of the opening along with the system you give to genBSDF.  If you make the mistake of leaving the edges open, then light that would NOT leak into your room would get by the geometry you give to genBSDF, and the generated BSDF would have too much transmission.

If your lamellas (slats) are different, then I expect your BSDFs will be different and should be calculated separately.

All Radiance primitives need to be able to pass through the xform command and maintain correct behavior.  If you insert a BSDF into your model, later scaling and reorienting the model with xform, a transform will be added to the BSDF primitive to make sure the distribution is properly oriented and the thickness is correct in the new units.

You should specify the thickness in the units corresponding to the model or scene file your BSDF is used with.

Sorry for the delay in our response.  Nicolas Roy has looked into it, and the latest we could hold our workshop is the second week of September.  How does the week of Sept. 10-14 work for everyone?  Are there other conferences conflicting with that week?

Just wanted to give a shout-out to Greg for making this conversation even possible. This BSDF capability is a tremendous addition to this thing we call Radiance! Happy Thanksgiving to those who celebrate, and Happy Saturday to all.

Hi all,

I wonder if anybody is aware of a daylighting metric for outdoor spaces. Do
we have any scale for that or all the studies target the interior spaces so
far.

One way came to my mind is to start from the adjacent buildings and then
calculate backward. Is there a better way to do that?

Hi Mostapha,

Interesting question. Generally, one can assume outdoor spaces are well-daylit unless they are located in Seattle or London. =)

What exactly do you mean by starting from the adjacent buildings and working backward? Defining a metric would be based on a totally different set of illumination criteria, glare tolerance, etc. It's an interesting question! What is your request based on, personal curiosity, or some new code/standard?

Hi Rob,

By coming backward I meant something like this:

If I assume > 100 lux and <2000 lux as the acceptable range. Then I
consider 60% of VLT for the glazing and 80% of reflectivity for ceiling
with a very rough calculation I need > 100 lux /(0.6*0.8) and <2000 lux
/(0.6*0.8) which is equal to  > 208 lux and <4166 lux. I know that I
disregarded many effective design aspects except the VT of the glazing, and
this way of calculation is not that accurate but it was the first thing
came to my mind to make an assumption for outdoor spaces like streets.

The other possible way with the same concept is to put the sensors inside
the adjacent interior spaces and then use the available daylight metrics.
For an urban design study I wanted to avoid measuring light levels inside
the buildings as far as possible.

The climate is cloudy enough to make a new London and unfortunately the
only effective code is solar hours in 21st of December which makes no sense
to me. I think you literally count the number of solar hours in a
potentially always going to be an overcast day.

I got quite excited by the topic... Acceptable,temperatures,radiation levels and wind speeds outdoors are an interest of mine. I have a colleague who has coined the term 'warm shade' to describe the concept many public spaces in New Zealand seek of staying in the warming rays of the sun while avoiding the worst of the UV from the same sun is a major focus especially in schools. 

However, I am guessing from your explanation, confessing i do not understand it entirely, that you are trying to determine an outdoor illuminance that will provide a reasonable indoor illuminance? If that is the case, then is suspect there are so many variables other than VLT that you should be concerned with,that the approach needs to be re-thought. Size of window? Reflectivity of the other surfaces in the space? how much direct as opposed to bounced or diffuse light makes up your 100 Lux....

Can you draw a diagram (ASCII crude will do) that shows the light path you are tracing?

Building Simulation and Optimization 10-11 Sep 2012 in Loughborough (UK):

We're hoping there'll be some lighting simulation papers at BSO12 (I'm on the committee), so it would help if we could avoid the first two days of that week.

Hi Mostapha,

> For an urban design study I wanted to avoid measuring light levels inside the buildings as far as possible.

How about using cumulative values, say annual or maybe monthly?  You could also look at just the hours of occupancy.  Some examples here:

http://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm/doku.php?id=academic:urban-solar

The image for London clearly shows the effect of tall buildings reducing the ground level cumulative illuminance (actually, irradiance in the legend but just x 100 to estimate klux-hrs / yr).

Hi John, Michael, et al.

Michael,

Sorry if it wasn't clear enough. I think you get the concept. Yes! I wonder
if there is a number to determine the outdoor illuminance to provide enough
illuminance level inside. What you are saying is true and the effective
parameters are much more than only VLT and ceiling reflectance but if I
want to consider all of them I should modify the geometry and run the
lighting simulation.

The way I did the ray-tracing in my mind was the simplest possible backward
ray-tracing. I started from the sensor inside, then traced only one ray
upward and bounced it from the ceiling to the glazing. So illuminance level
inside the space is equal to illuminance level outside the glazing (on the
envelope of the building that I can simulate) multiply by VLT of the
glazing multiply by the reflectance of the ceiling. In this way I can make
a target for the illuminance level on the envelopes rather than indoor.

The question could be more general though and thinking about the relation
between outdoor illuminance level and then the external envelopes.

John,

Thank you for the great link! This is exactly what I'm talking about. I
actually ran the accumulative annual study. That's true that cumulative
result shows you get less illuminace in more dense areas but what are the
cutting levels? Do we have the concept of over-daylit for outdoors?

For example if I calculate the availability of useful daylight illuminance
based on 100 lux and 2500 lux for working hours and calculate the result
based on the percentage of hours a large portion of the well-daylit outdoor
spaces will be considered as over-daylit because they receive more than
2500 lux, and then the more dark outdoor spaces located in Seattle or
London (hi Rob!) will be assumed as well-daylit since they will be in the
range. We already knew this is not true and the spaces next to an outdoor
space with 150 lux horizontal illuminance level cannot be well-daylit.

Maybe we can say there should be no upper-limit for outdoor illuminace
level since we can always mitigate the light level by building envelope
design, but what is the lower limit then?

Best,
Mostapha

PS.1: I liked the concept of "warm shade" so much. So interesting to think
about.... Can you send me a link to the paper or any other resources?

Hi Mostapha,

BRE has a metric - Vertical Skylight Component - for what you describe.  It is intended as a planning tool to insure that housing blocks are not located to close together.  It is also used in rights to light litigation in the UK.  It's independent of climate though, it's mainly to ensure that an appropriate percentage of daylight is made available at the window (i.e. not too many tall buildings nearby).  I'm not saying it's a great metric, but it's commonly used for what you want to do.  

VSC is commonly coupled with the hours of sunshine in a courtyard metric you mentioned in an earlier email.  I just want to point out that this is not a daylight metric but a planning tool to ensure that courtyards are not more damp and dank than an open park in the same climate.  For example, if you have a week of damp overcast weather both your open space and your courtyard will be damp, but then when you have a day of sunshine your park will dry up, but your courtyard may not if there isn't sufficient sun penetration.  A courtyard that stays damp gets even worse in the next week of wet weather.  The metric is intended to prevent mold, mildew and perpetually damp courtyards.  So in reality this metric is more applicable to climates like London and Seattle than Phoenix or Dubai.

Andy

Hi Andy,

Thank you for clarification and explanation. It was so informative.

I agree that using hours of sunshine (sunlight hours) in this way totally
make sense however in the code I mentioned it was a metric for building
envelopes (e.g. two hours of sunlight hours in 21st December is needed for
residential buildings).

As you said the weakness of metrics like VSC or Daylight Factor
(SC+ERC+IRC) is not being climate-based and orientation sensitive but maybe
this is the best possible way for now.

Thanks,
Mostapha
