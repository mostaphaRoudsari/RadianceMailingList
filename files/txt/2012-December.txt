Another problem now is that the larger .hdr image generated via the
vwrays+"rtrace with the -n option" approach can't be processed by pcomb. I
got the following error message "S: domain error" and "if: domain error"
when I tried the following script:

#_____________________________
oconv ./mat.rad ./geom.rad ./sky.rad > ./scene.oct

vwrays -ff -vf ./view.vf -x 500 -y 500 | rtrace -ab 0 `vwrays -d -vf
./view.vf -x 500 -y 500` -ffc -n 2 -af ./amb_f.amb ./scene.oct >
./SkyEF-vta_ab0.hdr

cat ./SkyEF-vta_ab0.hdr | pcomb -e
'solidAngle=S(1);ro=if(ri(1),solidAngle,0); go=if(gi(1),solidAngle,0);
bo=if(bi(1),solidAngle,0)' -o - > ./SkyEF_viz_solidAngles.hdr
#____________________________



The following script using rpict, however, is OK:
#_____________________________
oconv ./mat.rad ./geom.rad ./sky.rad > ./scene.oct

rpict -ab 0 -vf ./view.vf -x 500 -y 500 ./scene.oct > ./SkyEF-vta_ab0.hdr

cat ./SkyEF-vta_ab0.hdr | pcomb -e
'solidAngle=S(1);ro=if(ri(1),solidAngle,0); go=if(gi(1),solidAngle,0);
bo=if(bi(1),solidAngle,0)' -o - > ./SkyEF_viz_solidAngles.hdr
#____________________________


I assume the two "SkyEF-vta_ab0.hdr" generated through the two approaches
are different, not only in file size but also in image file content, which
may have caused pcomb unable to process the first one (created via
vwrays+rtrace) ...

... advices area greatly appreciated!

Ji,

My suggestion is to simplify your command.  Most of your time is probably being spent in pcomb, unless your scene is extremely complex.  Try:

	oconv -f ./plastic_mat.rad ./geom.rad \
	| rpict -av 1 1 1 -vf view_vts.vf -x 1000 -y 1000 \
	| pcomb -e 'lo=if(gi(1),0,S(1))' - \
	| pvalue -h -H -pG -d \
	| total \
	| rcalc -e '$1=$1/2/PI' > ./SkyEF_results.txt

Best,
-Greg

Thank you very much, Greg!

The method is faster (around 50% faster) now according to your suggestion!

I understand from your advise that there's no need to model the uniform
sky, and using the "-av 1 1 1" option for rpict can literally "color" the
geometries visible from the view specified  in light grey so that they can
be differentiated from the visible sky patch(es) which is rendered as black
in this case.

And also, the pcomb part of calculation can be performed for just one of
the RGB channels.

Thanks again!

- Ji

Hi, Greg, a follow-up based on some quick tests:

Maybe we still need to include the following definition of a "bright"
ground into the octree:

#___________________________
# content of SkyEF_ground.rad file
!gensky 6 21 +15.0  -a 1.0 -o 103.0 -m -105 -u -B 1.0

skyfunc glow ground_glow
0
0
4 1 1 1 0

ground_glow source ground
0
0
4 0 0 -1 180
#___________________________


It is to prevent some of the visible part of the ground below horizon
(rendered as black by rpict in your way) from being mistakenly recognized
as part of the sky (also rendered as black) in the pcomb related processing
...

- Cheers, Ji

Dear simulation community,

The Python programming language is well known as a powerful tool in
automation, scripting, and high performance scientific computing. In our
experience, countless hours have been saved in automating building
simulation tasks, allowing us to focus more on creating quality building
models and accurate performance results.

We believe that Python is positioned to make a big difference in the
building simulation community. To get started, we have the following offer:
Send us your scripting problems, and we will solve them for you!

In this phase, we are interested most in small well defined tasks. Example
problems would be;

"In my research, I need to parametrize 100 EnergyPlus files with different
U-Values"
"We need to convert 1000 files from format *.yyy to format *.qqq"
"Our company produces a report for each project, we use Excel to calculate
the average Lux levels from radiance, it's easy but boring after 100
projects"
Or anything else where you think - "I wish I had an intern do this for
me..." (Maybe you are this intern...)

Help us by defining your problem with steps taken and the desired result.
Send them to:
projects at pythonpoweredbuilding.com

For all problems received, we will recommend ideas, methods, and modules.
We will furthermore select 3 projects to solve and feature in our Workshop
during the Building Simulation 2013 conference in France next August
http://www.bs2013.fr/. We will also feature these problems on our website;
http://www.pythonpoweredbuilding.com.

Problems must therefore be free of any intellectual property and will be
open to all. For more information and more about us, please visit
http://www.pythonpoweredbuilding.com. If you are already a convert and want
to get involved, contact us at
info at pythonpoweredbuilding.com.<info at pythonpoweredbuilding.com>

Please excuse cross posting, we will direct further updates primarily to
BLDG-SIM.

Happy simulating,

I am a big fan of Python myself, and wrote a few simple scripts for me to use with radiance. I am no programmer, so can encourage and support any designer to take a look at the Python language, it's quite fun!

Btw, would be interested: are there professional Radiance modules for Python out there already? I once googled for them but without success.

Hi Aksel,

There is indeed interest in the Radiance community (I'm speaking as a
voyeur, not a Radiance expert), see i.e.;
https://sites.google.com/site/tbleicher/radiance/python-radiance
http://code.google.com/p/pyrat/
Etc.

I would love to have a Radiance script as a demo of how flexible Python is,
maybe there is some smallish task that we can tackle?

When I use Radiance, I see the input files, and all I can think of is; this
should be XML... Maybe there is interest in a 2-way parser?

As far as a more complete "wrapper" project is concerned, we would be happy
to also support in any way.

-Marcus

Hi guys,

Not sure if you (Marcus and Alan) remember me, but I tagged along on a lunch together when you visited NREL a while back. This sounds like a great and ambitious project. Of course, it's tied to a specific scripting language -- in this case, Python. I used to use Python a bit for just this type of Radiance automation, myself. The SPOT program (Radiance-based lighting photosensor placement and optimization tool) is a mix of Python and VBA. OpenStudio is primarily C++, but we export all of that C++ functionality to Ruby (and C#) in the form of SWIG "bindings". Much of the Radiance functionality in OpenStudio is actually a bunch of Ruby scripts. There are even elements of Radiance that are written in Perl. 

The point being that everyone has their favorite high level language. Our hand was forced to Ruby, simply because the OpenStudio project leverages SketchUp quite a bit, and the SketchUp API is in Ruby. It'd be great if we could leverage your (and your contributors') work in OpenStudio too, though. We should talk about how we might make that happen. I know SWIG supports Python, but the maintenance headache of supporting even just Ruby and C# is major; I doubt the team is interested in supporting yet another scripting language. However I do see an opportunity here, as we are rolling out the notion of "measures" in OpenStudio, which are pre-packaged energy efficiency measures (e.g. modify my model to have a WWR of .10 to .90 in .10 increments, simulate and compile the results, while I go have lunch). We should work together to see how we can best integrate your script library with OpenStudio and other tools. 

What do you think?

You can find some advanced scripts on Francesco's web site:

http://www.bozzograo.net/radiance/index.php?module=Downloads&func=view&cid=2&start=0

These are complete scripts that create new features on top of the Radiance
tool set. If you don't mind digging a bit you can look for the b/rad script
on his web site. It is a Radiance exporter for the 3D modeller Blender
(outdated though, won't work with the current Blender version). This
exporter has also a lot of import features and so the scripts modules show
how to read Radiance files.

As far as an "official" Radiance Python module goes there was some
discussion about it quite a while ago but that pretty much was it. I wrote
(or re-wrote) the base image class for wxfalsecolor specifically to allow a
reuse in other scripts but I don't think anyone has ever used it. I think
one of the reasons is that with Radiance even trivial scripting can go a
long way in terms of automation. Most scripts will be written quick and
dirty and don't need big complicated wrappers to serve their purpose.
Radiance encourages this because it's composed of numerous command line
tools, each with a simple task.

I don't know too much about EnergyPlus and the options to use it on the
command line. Perhaps there is not much to do about the actual calculation
part of the process and the automation comes in when the input is created
or the output is processed. In both cases a parser library for the file
formats used by EP would come in quite handy.

Regards,
Thomas

Hi Rob

Based on my experience with Radiance scripting in
Python|Ruby|Bash|Lua|whatever I'd say that it really doesn't matter much
which language you use as long as your application has a good command line
interface:

1) small single-purpose apps are better than one big app to rule them all
2) process options should be exposed via command line arguments
3) good error reporting and some form of progress reporting for long
running processes

I think the scripting community would be better served if you implement a
good command line interface to your binaries and Ruby scripts than by just
another language wrapper.

My 2 CI cent,

Thomas

Hey Thomas,

I totally agree, and that's why I have tried very hard to maintain such an interface to the OpenStudio/Radiance stuff. While Application/GUI integration is a priority, all of the Radiance stuff starts out as a Ruby script prototype, and I build in command line switches to all of the functionality. As someone who learned Radiance from the command line, I totally respect the UNIX toolbox model, and feel like our tools need to play nice in that arena. If anything, I've learned that most of my stuff is to large and monolithic, and I'd like to break down or refactor a lot of what I've written to be more modular like Radiance. But as it is, everything we've implemented in Ruby has full command line functionality (and help), and I expect we'll keep that interface an option for the foreseeable future.

Dear simulation community,

The Python programming language is well known as a powerful tool in automation, scripting, and high performance scientific computing. In our experience, countless hours have been saved in automating building simulation tasks, allowing us to focus more on creating quality building models and accurate performance results.

We believe that Python is positioned to make a big difference in the building simulation community. To get started, we have the following offer: Send us your scripting problems, and we will solve them for you!

In this phase, we are interested most in small well defined tasks. Example problems would be;

"In my research, I need to parametrize 100 EnergyPlus files with different U-Values"
"We need to convert 1000 files from format *.yyy to format *.qqq"
"Our company produces a report for each project, we use Excel to calculate the average Lux levels from radiance, it's easy but boring after 100 projects"
Or anything else where you think - "I wish I had an intern do this for me..." (Maybe you are this intern...)

Hi everyone,

It's me again, with new troubles... sorry for that.

I have been trying to implement the Three Phase Method on two different PCs
and two different OS, and not good news so far. Long story short, the NREL
precompiled Radiance for Windows returned only zeroes when dctimestep was
called (Andy McNeil helped me to discard syntax errors ... THANKS FOR
THAT); Ubuntu used to give me no answer, then it took turns between
"reinhart.cal not found" and some other similar things, and now it keep
throwing "segmentation fault" (my sky vector is not full of zeroes). I
already tried reinstalling my Linux distribution, compiling the Head
version (I think I did it ok), searching on the web, preinstalling x11 dev
library, and installing Learnix... but "segmentation fault" keeps there, in
the two PCs.

anyway, until now, all my compilations "have had some errors" and
dctimestep has worked some times, but I haven't been able to understand why
sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't... I am pretty stucked here. If
there is any trick for installing RADIANCE or getting the permissions to
avoid "segmentation fault", any advice would help a lot.

THANKS

Hi Greg,

For installing I did "sudo ./makeall install" and "sudo ./makeall library".
For the dctimestep use I did:

*dctimestep Matrices/V.vmx
Matrices/Tforward.xml Matrices/D.dmx Matrices/S.skv > results/3phase.txt*
*
*
I, of course, had a directory called Matrices where all my files were
stored. The *Tforward.xml* was generating using genBSDF on a simple clear
window, and the Daylight and View matrix were computed folowing the Andy
McNeil tutorial.

I tend to think it is a problem in the configuration of Ubuntu? I mean, the
permissions or something. But I do not know how to fix it.

What does someone need to get started using Radiance? Computer, Cad
versions, etc. Is there any beginners resource for this program?

Hi,

Something that has worked for me until now (I am still learning) is to
follow the tutorials (http://www.radiance-online.org/learning/tutorials)
from the basics, and to read the mailing list e-mails every now and then.

Until now I have not used any other CAD interface than SketchUp, so I am
useless in that area.

Hi Tim,

Germ?n has pointed you to a great page, and of course the mailing list archives are very useful. Randolph Fritz can get you a copy of the Rendering with Radiance text, which is the rosetta stone for figuring out a lot of Radiance's underpinnings. As far as CAD you can use just about anything, but there are some tools for specific CAD programs that make life easier going from CAD, to RAD. Thomas Bleicher has the su2rad program which allows you to take a SketchUp model and convert it to a Radiance project, complete with a GUI for assigning materials and the like. The DIVA for Rhino project facilitates the use of Rhinoceros models in Radiance. OpenStudio also leverages SketchUp for geometry creation, but allows you to convert the thing to Radiance as well.

Speaing about Rendering With Radiance,

How can I get "The Book" from Randolph Fritz? is a matter of sending him an
e-mail? how can I contact him? There is one copy on Amazon, but since it is
a reseller, I can not get it brought to Chile.

I am really interested on it.

THANKS

Yes, I have *Rendering With Radiance* available for US$35 + shipping and handling.  There will--eventually--be a web site and a free PDF.  

Meantime, anyone who wants copies can write me at randolph+pub at panix.com.  US shipping and handling is US$6; Canada US$19, other international is usually US$30, but international shipping costs vary--write me with a shipping address for the price.

Germ?n, I'll be writing you directly with ordering information.

 Performance Simulation
In-Reply-To: <mailman.194.1354621001.2200.radiance-general@radiance-online.org>

Message-ID: <9052C9D8-C9F5-44CE-912E-E894F9921159@vuw.ac.nz>

Hi Rob/Thomas

I have to express some ambivalence on this topic. Having reCently published a paper expressing my views on the quick 'performance sketch' approach to models, I confess to being a fan of small quick repetitive analysis tasks using fully capable software. Rather than using behemoth BIM models, lightweight models and sophisticated modelling software is The way to mainstream simulation. 

That said, in trying to mainstream daylight and energy analysis and acoustic analysis with a class of 200 architecture, building science and interiors students, I am struggling to get them to think about modelling as an abstraction exercise. There is something inherently satisfying about the apparent reality of the behemoth BIM with its door handles modelled, which students are reluctant to turn away from. They want their models to look real in their 3D form, not to be a simple representation of the lighting (or thermal, or acoustic) principles at work in their design. 

it is hard enough to focus students on this form of abstraction. If I was also to ask them to work with a series of tools in an analysis  toolbox then the push back would be immense. My student engagement with the results of analysis has improved out of sight as we have moved from a command line or script interface towards a 3D model with associated calculation capabilities. If I look at the OpenStudio approach, then I am ecstatic that the people learning simulation now engage early with modelling the influence of their design ideas on performance, and are no longer struggling with text interfaces. They come back to those text interfaces with a clear idea of what more they want to do. But then they find the same problem that even experienced users of scripts / text interfaces find - that there are so many scripts / tools that knowing which one to use or finding whether is a mind boggling task. This applies even when you know the script / capability exists in the toolbox. I and some grad students face exactly this issue with OpenStudio - we know and useEnergyPlus/GenOpt, we want to compare it to openStudio/Dakota as weaving Radiance into the optimisation would be such an improvement. We know and can see examples of Ruby scripts for Dakota. But getting it running is something we do not have the time for..

Another architectural world is facing similar issues: scripting of parametric relationships in geometry within the Rhino modeller. There is some empirical research that suggests people are more effective modellers when they have the Grasshopper graphical interface to the scripts available. Grasshopper provides an interface to the Rhino script which represent snippets of script code as boxes which are graphically 'wired' together. However, even experienced users of Grasshopper+Rhino find it difficult to find the box/snippet of code that does the job they are thinking about. Many versions of the same geometrical operation are produced because the catalogue of box/snippets does not exist or describes them in unfamiliar ways. 

I am very keen to support this Python toolbox idea, but caution it is only as good as the database/interface to the tools. Clearly, the Ecotect approach is something to be learned from. It was constructed as a consistent interface to a bunch of analytical tools. It is best used in a mode where the interface is used to create different models for different analytical purposes, and the advantage is consistency of modelling environment. Unfortunately, this consistent modelling interface tempts the user to the notion it would be more efficient to have one model... With respect to the Python toolbox, it seems to me the Python part is the simple part. What we all need to think about when creating these suggested Python suitable tasks is
a) a set of tags/ key words that would make the code accessible in a world where many hundreds of tools are in the tool box;
b) a set of modelling guidelines that are associated with each script that enable the user to group tools by abstraction level /type and hence plan how many models might be required;

With this assistance from us, Marcus, Clayton and Allen have a chance of building a set of tools that we all embrace. I am thinking, I'd like this kind of exercise to provide not just a few Python tools I can dream up, but make accessible a whole bunch of others' ideas as well.

While Application/GUI integration is a priority, all of the Radiance stuff starts out as a Ruby script prototype, and I build in command line switches to all of the functionality. As someone who learned Radiance from the command line, I totally respect the UNIX toolbox model, and feel like our tools need to play nice in that arena. If anything, I've learned that most of my stuff is to large and monolithic, and I'd like to break down or refactor a lot of what I've written to be more modular like Radiance. But as it is, everything we've implemented in Ruby has full command line functionality (and help), and I expect we'll keep that interface an option for the foreseeable future.

Of course, it's tied to a specific scripting language -- in this case, Python. I used to use Python a bit for just this type of Radiance automation, myself. The SPOT program (Radiance-based lighting photosensor placement and optimization tool) is a mix of Python and VBA. OpenStudio is primarily C++, but we export all of that C++ functionality to Ruby (and C#) in the form of SWIG "bindings". Much of the Radiance functionality in OpenStudio is actually a bunch of Ruby scripts. There are even elements of Radiance that are written in Perl.

Our hand was forced to Ruby, simply because the OpenStudio project leverages SketchUp quite a bit, and the SketchUp API is in Ruby. It'd be great if we could leverage your (and your contributors') work in OpenStudio too, though. We should talk about how we might make that happen. I know SWIG supports Python, but the maintenance headache of supporting even just Ruby and C# is major; I doubt the team is interested in supporting yet another scripting language. However I do see an opportunity here, as we are rolling out the notion of "measures" in OpenStudio, which are pre-packaged energy efficiency measures (e.g. modify my model to have a WWR of .10 to .90 in .10 increments, simulate and compile the results, while I go have lunch). We should work together to see how we can best integrate your script library with OpenStudio and other tools.

Hi Germ?n,

You should never get a segmentation fault in Radiance, whatever you do.  At this point, we should take the discussion off-list to work out what is going wrong with your compile and/or operation on Ubuntu.  I will send another e-mail shortly.  Do not reply to this one.

We will post a summary of what we find to the list when the issue is resolved.  There may be some delays as I am presently on vacation.

Cheers,
-Greg

Hi Michael,

One thing I should point out is that OpenStudio has a companion piece,
called the building component library (BCL), which is currently under
development. This is a database of "building model components" --
everything from a weather file, to discrete code for describing a piece of
mechanical equipment, what-have-you. Another element we will have in the
BCL is "measures", which are parametric snippets of code that can step
through a model and modify or perturb different elements of the model,
consistently. This speaks to your desire for a consistent database and
interface to the various tools, and will also help folks like yourself get
up and running with scripting a little bit better.

This issue is no different from the zillions of AutoLISP routines out
there for AutoCAD users -- no portal exists to all of these little
programs (some of which got subsumed by AutoCAD itself).

I absolutely agree with your first paragraph. We believe the Chicago
politics adage "vote early, and vote often" can be applied in our field:
"model early and often". Too many energy models are created simply to
document the energy savings for a LEED submittal. OpenStudio is all about
lightweight models, run rigorously.

Anyway that's my buck and a half on the topic. We should also probably
move this thread to the dev list, should it continue (which I hope it
does)...

Though many of us use Radiance directly in our various flavors of lighting design/visual impact analyses, I seek a list of currently supported software titles which either imbed Radiance or draw upon it directly. Any information regarding architectural field impact and the fields it penetrates, particularly in non-research environments, would also be most helpful.
Rather than clutter the list mailing, please send information directly to me, and if of general interest, I will post the accumulated list.
Thanks in advance!

Hi Radiance list,

I posted also to TRNSYS, BLDG-SIM, E+, ESPR, but so far Radiance listers
are in the lead for discussion!

We believe that Python is the best language for "the community". Therefore,
we are trying to take the first steps in introducing Python to the
community.

I am digesting a lot of feedback and can see some next steps.

First: There are several Large projects out there which are very exciting,
and I will try to summarize them on our website, and maybe we can assist
with some of them in the future. So I can see that one aspect of this
initiative will be simply a website which lists these potential ideas and
more developed projects and promotes contributions to them, alongside some
"getting started" examples, and how-to-install-python guides.

So far from Radiance;
http://code.google.com/p/pyrat/
https://sites.google.com/site/tbleicher/radiance/python-radiance
www.bozzograo.net/radiance/index.php?module=Downloads&func=view&cid=2&start=0

Second: We will work on getting some simple example python "scripts" using
Radiance, maybe something from the above sites, just 100 lines, well
commented, as getting started examples. (Anyone want to help? I can give
you authorship access to the site!)

Third: I believe that Python scripting can benefit any of the users of the
aforementioned lists, a cross community initiative, this is a big
advantage. However, I can see, after re-subscribing to 6 lists and sifting
through messages, that the community is rather fragmented. So I will need
to think about how to build a better network.

Ok, that's my thinking-out-loud for now. I'm now also subscribed to the
dev- list if this discussion is moved.

Thanks!

-Marcus

Subject: [Radiance-general] UDI upper limits
Message-ID: <ADE6E132-7DF4-48E4-A81D-6D9FEED069C5@gmx.net>

Hi all,

I have seen several definitions of the UDI illuminance ranges around, with "UDI-e" (exceed) starting at 2000, 2500 or 3000lx. I really wonder what is the commonly used range these days? Can anyone here share some insight on this moving target for daylighting optimizations? ;)

Cheers, Lars.

Hey Lars,

I've actually not heard of alternatives to the 2K lux UDI-e limit. Where
have you seen these proposed? Does John M. wanna weigh in on this?

HMG research has not found an upper limit that relates to human subjective
responses with regard to glare or excessive daylight.

Efficiency is Now. 2010 ACEEE Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in
Buildings. Asilomar, CA: ACEEE Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in
Buildings, pp. 3.348?3.361.
 

Some of my human factors research has shown very high levels can be
?preferred? but does lend some support for an upper limit similar to UDI
concept.
?An upper horizontal illuminance comfort-based threshold, as required by
Daylight Saturation Percentage or Useful Daylight Illuminance metrics,
should be set between 2000-4300 lux, but must be applied with an
understanding that some individuals may prefer values as high as 5000 lux
(during some parts of the year), thus confidently identifying only the most
extreme cases as uncomfortable.? (KVDW, 2012)

I believe Mardaljevic has been considering higher alternative thresholds as
well.

Hi Rob, Kevin & Radiance folks,

the latest 3K lux limit I found on John's site:

http://climate-based-daylighting.com/doku.php?id=academic:climate-based-daylight-modelling

In this paper, the 2500lx was mentioned:

http://www.thedaylightsite.com/filebank/Tools and Metrics - JM2.pdf (yes, the spaces are included in the URL)

The 2000lx has been used most as far as I am aware. I can understand that the upper limit is not hard (as Kevin said, it can be argued that such a limit does not make sense at all, which is still kind of an open discussion). Still I find it tricky to reference a UDI metric with all these definitions. I tend to use John's climate-based-daylighting.com as a (moving) reference, which would lead me to "latest revision of UDI-e is >3000lx.

Cheers, Lars.

Hi Simin,

The color won't be different if all three of your data files are the same.  You could just use brightdata in that case.  Without knowing what is in "rang.cal", it's difficult to even guess what this will do.

The real parameters to colordata are optional, and used by your .cal file for whatever purpose suits you.

Dear Greg,

As for a test, rang.cal is just the original file in the library:

{ Compute incident angle in degrees (from either side) }
rang(dx,dy,dz) = 180/PI*Acos(abs(Nx*dx+Ny*dy+Nz*dz));

rgb data files are different.

I have updated my material library like that:

void colordata Try
8 noop noop noop rdatafile.dat gdatafile.dat bdatafile.dat rang.cal rang
0
0

Try plastic a
0
0
5 0.35 0.35 0.35   0 0

rdatafile.dat:

1

0 90 9

0
.1
.2
.3
.4
.5
.6
.7
.8

gdatafile.dat

1

0 90 9

0
.2
.4
.6
.8
1
.8
.6
.2

bdatafile.dat

1

0 90 9

1
.9
.8
.7
.6
.5
.4
.3
.2

Those data are just for a test. I am using DIVA to connect radiance with
rhino. The final result of this material rendering so far is just a black
screen.

Do you have any idea of that?

Best,
Simin Wang

Message-ID: <AE2C06A5D4A79244AA0AB930A5BFD04B147BB231@ITSMBX-4.lunet.lboro.ac.uk>

Does John M. wanna weigh in on this?

I believe Mardaljevic has been considering higher alternative thresholds as well.

Yes, on both counts.

Original UDI of 100-2,000 lux was conceived around 2004, and was, with hindsight, a little too conservative regarding the upper limit.  I suspect now that those studies giving preferred maxima less than 2,000 lux could well have been the older articles in our sample.  Quite possible that work environments of around 20 years ago were less forgiving of high daylight illuminances, e.g. curved CRT screens, etc.  It seems that the more recent studies are all nudging-up the preferred / tolerated upper limit.

Splitting the UDI range at the design level (e.g. 300 lux) was done in 2007 and applied to the (1st) VELUX study.  For the past few years I've been using the values 100, 300 and 3,000 lux to define the four UDI ranges: fell-short (<100); supplementary (100 - 300); autonomous (300 - 3,000); and, exceeded (>3,000).  For general daylighting use I don't see any need to alter the 100 and 300 lux bounds, but there may be good cause to increase the upper limit to 3,500 or 4,000 lux (greater?).  I'll be doing some sensitivity tests on that seeing how it affects annual totals for the autonomous and exceeded ranges.  It may not make much difference for many designs, at least in terms of UDI-autonomous and UDI-exceeded.  Though that's not to say that it wouldn't have knock-on consequences for, say, annual predictions of DGP.

I do find the four range UDI scheme very useful to help evaluate (and communicate) the daylighting performance of a space -- especially when there are several facade variants to be considered and a simple slide transition reveals the impact of the design change in a manner that is very readily assimilated.  For other, more specialist applications, I see no problem in adjusting the three defining lux levels to suit, e.g. 20, 50 and 200 for a gallery space where conservation is an issue.

So, UDI -- no fixed rules.  Though a consensus for general daylighting applications may be forming around the 100, 300 and 3,000 (or 4,000?) lux values.

John

John,

A very timely and useful response thank you.  As you know the EFA (Education Funding Agency) in the UK has released its FOS (Facilities Output Specification) for the next generation of schools.  The directive from the government was a higher standard of space for lower cost / m2.

We made the decision to drop daylight factors and move to CBDM for the next generation of schools and the topic of the UDI exceed level came up during the writing and testing of the baseline design and indeed it has come up again since as people try and create standard designs.  As it stands the UDI autonomous was set at 100-2000 in the FOS.  What this means for designers when you look at a balanced design, (thermal and lighting), you need to control heat gain with smaller external windows and therefore supplement the daylight from a secondary source.  However, this costs money.  E.g. Atria, lightwells, lightpipes etc.

What is interesting when you raise the UDI exceed from 2000 to 3000 then you can start again to design single sided lit spaces just as we had with DF's (indeed the type of rooms we are trying to stop building as the blinds are typically pulled down and the lights are turned on).  My thought therefore is whether in raising UDIe to 3000 because say a person can typically accept that level of light, then means we have significantly increased the contrast in a single sided lit space.  If we have, have we increased it to a level where parts of the space feel gloomy?   Is the answer to move UDIa to 300-3000, does that matter much?

Regards

Andrew

Andrew,

I guess the outcome then starts to depend strongly on what you consider to be an acceptable value for UDI-exceeded.  As the HMG work has indicated, that's a difficult one to determine empirically, and I for one can't suggest a 'target' value for the occurrence of UDI-e.  I'd like to see a UDI sensitivity study carried for a large number of spaces covering a wide range of space types (i.e. glazing orientation, single-sided, multi-aspect, etc.) [1].  If, as you say, extending the UDI upper bound to 3,000 lux results in designs that we suspect are less good than using 2,000 lux, then we really do need to pause and scratch our heads a little to nail this one.  However, your question suggests that going for UDI-a (300 - 3,000 lux) rather than 100 - 3,000 lux makes it less likely that the outcome is what we might have had with daylight factors.  Seems plausible -- do we have anything yet to support this hypothesis?

I'd assumed that the 100 to 2,000 lux UDI range adopted in the FOS was simply taken from the Mk. 1 UDI formulation.  Do you know if, instead, it was actually the result of some testing of range limits?  By way of pedantry, suggest we use the term UDI to describe the complete range (e.g. 100 to 2,000 or, more recently, 100 to 3,000 lux), and UDI-autonomous for the occurrence between the design level (300 lux) and the upper limit (3,000 lux).

By the way, there is now a PDF available of the Lighting Supplement for the Dec 2012 CIBSE Journal:

Message-ID: <CAD83LV+y4Zf7Ju1r9RJS4PSo5=RXPuAW9fvksOASuHKVRG59SQ@mail.gmail.com>

May I ask if anybody compiled the *GenCumulativeSky* program created by
Darren Robinson for *Mac OS*?

Darren mentioned that the source code of GenCumulativeSky is written in *C++
*. I assume we can use *Xcode* to compile it as an executable program for
the Mac system. But I don't know how to do it ...

Currently, I have to run GenCumulativeSky in Win7 to generate the sky.cal
and SunFile.rad file based on the epw file for a given city and use the 2
files in Mac system with other Radiance program. It's just a little bit
inconvenient...

Advices are greatly appreciated!

You don't even need to use the Xcode IDE, you can call the compiler (g++) directly if there's a makefile. If you point me to the source code, I can give it a whirl.

Currently, I have to run GenCumulativeSky in Win7 to generate the sky.cal and SunFile.rad file based on the epw file for a given city and use the 2 files in Mac system with other Radiance program. It's just a little bit inconvenient...

Advices are greatly appreciated!

(This probably belongs on ?general, rather than ?dev?)

The Qt-based rvu is located with all your other Windows Radiance programs, usually c:\Program Files\Radiance\bin. You can double-click the rvu.exe file and load an octree from there, or from the command line you can just type "rvu your_model.oct".

I am working on updated installers this week as well, so stay tuned for an update announcement.

Hi, Rob, many thanks for your reply!

The source code of GenCumulativeSky can be found at: (including a short
guide prepared by Darren)
https://documents.epfl.ch/groups/u/ur/urbansimulation/www/GenCumSky/GenCumSky.zip

... the download link is mentioned in one of the chapters in the book
edited by Darren:
Robinson, Darren (Ed.). (2011). Computer modelling for sustainable urban
design : physical principles, methods and applications. London ;
Washington, DC: Earthscan.

It seems Prof Christoph Reinhart in MIT has revised the program and added
some new options, and the updated version is included in the latest DIVA
installation package, see the discussion at:
http://diva4rhino.com/forum/topics/gencumulativesky-exe-problem

Would appreciate if you can share the detailed procedures of the
compilation (for a C/C++ programming rookie)!

Thanks!

Hi Ji,

Thanks for the link, I grabbed the source and right in the readme was a suggested compiler command:

"g++ -D_XOPEN_SOURCE *.cpp -lm -o gencumulativesky"

The above command worked a treat on my dilapidated Mac Pro (still running 10.6). The command expects a specifically-formatted weather file which I do not have on hand, so I couldn't test it aside from calling the command with no input and getting the help, but that did work. The only thing to remember is to set the permissions to make it executable on your system (e.g. "chmod 775 gencumulativesky").

P.S.
Christoph also mentions gencumulativesky in his (excellent) daylighting chapter in this fairly awesome book:

It is probable that you have multiple errors.  Your rays are probably not even striking the surface with your plastic material, since the rangl.cal file you are using defines a function rather than a variable for "rang", which should produce an error if it is ever called.

Do you even have a surface defined in your scene?  Is this all there is?  You really need to spend some time on the basics in Radiance and show us your complete files or there is not enough information to help you.

Hi, Rob, thank you very much! I'll ask a friend who knows C++
programming/compilation to try it out. Will digest Christoph's book chapter
as well.

- Cheers, Ji.

Hi, Rob and the list, a small follow-up question:

I was testing GenCumulativeSky.exe to get the* annual "global horizontal
radiation"* for *a single unobstructed upward sensor*.

The results is* *always *SMALLER or LOWER *than the *SUM of the "global
horizontal radiation" column in the epw file*. (For London.epw, up to 2.7%
lower; for Paris.epw, up to 1.73% lower, for Singapore.epw, up to 1.5%
lower ...)

May I ask:
1) Is the difference in this kind of magnitude acceptable?
2) is the difference related to the parameters for rtrace (I assume not, as
the sensor is unobstructed and the scene is empty...)?

Thanks!
-Ji

No worries, Ji!

I should also mention that you sorta DO need Xcode to do this, because installing that is how you get your compilers and linkers, should you want to try this on your own on MacOS.

Message-ID: <CCF0AA6F.17D5C%robert.guglielmetti@nrel.gov>

Happy Friday!

Just a quick note to let y'all know that we have updated all of the
Radiance binary installers, and they are available for download at the
NREL OpenStudio website. Specifically, here:

https://openstudio.nrel.gov/getting-started-developer/getting-started-radia
nce

Scroll down a tad, and you'll see a section called "Download Radiance
Binaries". We offer Windows 32-bit, MacOS Universal, and Linux 32-bit and
Linux 64-bit. 

Chris Humann, I went back to dynamically linked libraries, so these won't
work for ya on OSX 10.5, sorry. There have been a bunch of updates and
fixes to a lot of the three-phase stuff for Windows, so Windows users
should definitely grab themselves a copy. This round should also fix the
Qt Rvu for many users. Please let me know if you have any difficulties
with the new packages.

Have a good weekend,

Hi Ji,

I was testing GenCumulativeSky.exe to get the* annual "global horizontal
radiation"* for *a single unobstructed upward sensor*.

The results is* *always *SMALLER or LOWER *than the *SUM of the "global
horizontal radiation" column in the epw file*. (For London.epw, up to 2.7%
lower; for Paris.epw, up to 1.73% lower, for Singapore.epw, up to 1.5%
lower ...)

May I ask:
1) Is the difference in this kind of magnitude acceptable?
2) is the difference related to the parameters for rtrace (I assume not, as
the sensor is unobstructed and the scene is empty...)?

I'd say those results are acceptable.  You are always going to get small differences depending on the how the skies are normalised and the cumulative map generated.  I'm not familiar with GenCumulativeSky, but my own cumulative sky approach usually gets me within 1 or 2% of the column total from the climate file.  Anything in that range I wouldn't worry about.

Best
John

Hi, John, thanks for your reply!

Is your approach of generating cumulative sky described in your PhD thesis?
I'll go back to read through it.

BTW, I tried to compile GenCumulativeSky on Mac OS (the version modifed by
Prof Christoph Reinhart), and I got some error messages shown below which I
assume are related to C++ programming convention:

cSkyVault.cpp: In member function ?void
cSkyVault::CalculateSky(cSkyVault::eSunType, bool, bool, double)?:

Strangely, the compiled one can still be used with all the functions
intact.

So, I'd like to ask:
1) what does the error message mean?
2) will the errors affect the compilation?
3) what should I do to the source code to get rid of these errors?

Hi Ji,

Is your approach of generating cumulative sky described in your PhD thesis?

No, it came a little later -- though the sky model mixing function used is the one in the thesis.  Also, the brightdata format used for the cumulative sky is very similar to the one used to get the sky luminance scans into Radiance for the validation.

There's a number of ways that a cumulative sky can be fashioned.

1. Single 'glow' source with associated brightdata file containing the cumulative radiance of the diffuse sky and all the suns, i.e. the sun radiance is 'smeared' over the brightdata patch.

2. A 'glow' source as above, but now only for the cumulative diffuse sky component.  Additionally, you must add a number of direct 'light' sources where each one is set to have the cumulative radiance of all the suns that occur in the occupied bins for a gridded distribution in altitude and azimuth.  An 8deg bin width for both altitude and azimuth results in about 200 'light' sources depending on the latitude.  Now, rather than being smeared, the suns are slightly displaced to the bin-mean alt-azi position.

I use option #2, i.e. 'glow' source for the sky and multiple 'light' sources for all the suns.  It's more computationally expensive than #1, however the 'light' sources will get illumination deep into a model (i.e. through windows etc) without having to rely on cranking-up the resolution of the ambient parameters.  Both types have their attractions; I don't know which one GenCumulativeSky uses.

The method used in #2 to aggregate the sun radiance is (mostly) described in this paper: J. Mardaljevic and M. Rylatt. Irradiation mapping of complex urban environments: an image-based approach. Energy and Buildings, 35(1):27?35, 1 2003. Send me an email if you have trouble getting hold of it.

Cheers

Ji

The messages you are seeing are not errors, just warnings. Errors stop the
compiler from creating the binary. In your case the binary is successfully
created.

The warnings seem harmless to me in the given context. So I suppose it's
save to ignore them.

Regards,
Thomas

Thank you very much, John and Thomas!

I've found John's paper, and will read it later.

As far as I know, GenCumulativeSky also has two ways to create cumulative
sky: the smeared sun approach (+s1 option) and the binned sun approach (+s2
option), which might be similar to John's method #1 and #2 respectively
(see its options below, the -r, -p, and -E option were added by the
DIVA/DAYSIM team, I guess).


###################################
Usage: GenCumulativeSky [-d] [+s1|+s2] [-a latitude] [-o longitude] [-l]
[-m standard meridian] [-h hour shift] [-G|-B|-E] <climate file>
(Note: longitude +ve East of Greenwich)

        -d      Ignore diffuse irradiance
        +s1     Use "smeared sun" approach (default)
        +s2     Use "binned sun" approach

Yes, we added these options later to Darren's code so that the program becomes more usable. We have done a bit a 'validation' work of the tool as documented here: http://www.ibpsa.org/proceedings/BS2011/P_1813.pdf

Thank you very much, John and Thomas!

I've found John's paper, and will read it later.

As far as I know, GenCumulativeSky also has two ways to create cumulative sky: the smeared sun approach (+s1 option) and the binned sun approach (+s2 option), which might be similar to John's method #1 and #2 respectively (see its options below, the -r, -p, and -E option were added by the DIVA/DAYSIM team, I guess).


###################################
Usage: GenCumulativeSky [-d] [+s1|+s2] [-a latitude] [-o longitude] [-l] [-m standard meridian] [-h hour shift] [-G|-B|-E] <climate file>
(Note: longitude +ve East of Greenwich)

        -d      Ignore diffuse irradiance
        +s1     Use "smeared sun" approach (default)
        +s2     Use "binned sun" approach
        -l      Output luminance instead of radiance
        -r      Output radiance/179000 (ensures that units in the Radiance Image Viewer are in kWhm-2)
        -p      Output radiance/1000 (ensures that units in the Radiance RGB data file  are in kWhm-2)
        -G      File format is col1=global irradiance (W/m2), col2=diffuse irradiance (W/m2)
        -B      File format is col1=direct horizontal irradiance (W/m2), col2=diffuse irradiance (W/m2)
        -E      File format is an energyplus weather file (*.epw) The gprogram uses the global irradiance (W/m2) and diffuse irradiance (W/m2) data columns.

Hi Ji,

Is your approach of generating cumulative sky described in your PhD thesis?

No, it came a little later -- though the sky model mixing function used is the one in the thesis.  Also, the brightdata format used for the cumulative sky is very similar to the one used to get the sky luminance scans into Radiance for the validation.

There's a number of ways that a cumulative sky can be fashioned.

1. Single 'glow' source with associated brightdata file containing the cumulative radiance of the diffuse sky and all the suns, i.e. the sun radiance is 'smeared' over the brightdata patch.

2. A 'glow' source as above, but now only for the cumulative diffuse sky component.  Additionally, you must add a number of direct 'light' sources where each one is set to have the cumulative radiance of all the suns that occur in the occupied bins for a gridded distribution in altitude and azimuth.  An 8deg bin width for both altitude and azimuth results in about 200 'light' sources depending on the latitude.  Now, rather than being smeared, the suns are slightly displaced to the bin-mean alt-azi position.

I use option #2, i.e. 'glow' source for the sky and multiple 'light' sources for all the suns.  It's more computationally expensive than #1, however the 'light' sources will get illumination deep into a model (i.e. through windows etc) without having to rely on cranking-up the resolution of the ambient parameters.  Both types have their attractions; I don't know which one GenCumulativeSky uses.

The method used in #2 to aggregate the sun radiance is (mostly) described in this paper: J. Mardaljevic and M. Rylatt. Irradiation mapping of complex urban environments: an image-based approach. Energy and Buildings, 35(1):27-35, 1 2003. Send me an email if you have trouble getting hold of it.

Hi Shalian,

Absolutely, you can do that kind of analysis. I encourage you to check out DAYSIM, SPOT, and DIVA for Rhino, as well as the man page for the Radiance program 'rsensor'. I'm stealing a few minutes here while on vacation, so my reply will necessarily be this breif. BUt some Googling on the programs above should get you started!

IF you use an ambient file and the ray tracing of direct stuff is trivial, the easiest and fastest trick is to run multiple rpict instances of the same view using the same ambient file, trash all but one.
this makes the ambient file faster to populate and therefore the the image.
I have used this in the past and the speed increase was noticeable, but the overall time was large.
I am not sure you would see a gain in an image that takes very little to compute?. but you could try...
