Subject: [Radiance-general] why "global horizontal illuminance" is smaller
 than "global horizontal radiation" multiplied by 179 in epw file?
Message-ID: <CAD83LV+44Y9qKcr-47B34uYtMmQ5Ra03XDNbvrc+rSp_42Z-GA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list, Happy New Year!

I have a simple question related to conversion from irradiance value to
illuminance value, and pls correct me if I'm wrong:

Usually we can estimate the *illuminance (lux)* for a given point by
multiplying the *irradiance (w/m2)* for the point as simulated via Radiacne
by *179 (lm/w)* which is the luminous efficacy used in Radiance, or more
strictly (R*0.265+G*0.670+B*0.065)*179.

However, it seems that in a epw weather file the* "global horizontal
illuminance"* value is not equal to but smaller than the *"global
horizontal radiation" value multiplied by 179*.

May I ask:
1. why there's such a large discrapency?
2. Will this lead to over-estimation of illuminance when using cumulative
sky derived from "global horizontal radiation" ?

Thanks in advance!

- Ji

Hi Ji,

179 is the efficacy of white (equal energy) light over the visible
spectrum.

Daylight is composed of a broader spectrum, so the efficacy (visible light
per watt of energy) is lower.  Usually around 90 for the sun and 110 for
the sky, but changes based on various factors.

179 is used in Radiance as a convention since we are simulating visible
light.  So when you're defining you sky using gensky with weather data you
need to either use the measured illuminance values and divide by 179 to get
radiometric units for the visible spectrum, or use the measured radiance
values (for solar spectrum), multiply by an approximate efficacy, then
divide 179 to get radiometric units for the visible spectrum only.

If you use gendaylit all the conversions are done for you.

Best,
Andy

Hello,

has anyone in this list ever used BRD-CAD 7.22 for Mac to create models for Radiance?

If so, how do you convert BRL-CAD models to a format compatible with Radiance?

Many thanks.

I see, thank you very much, Andy!

So, can we put it as:
The *"global horizontal radiation" *in the epw file is a total solar
radiation value* NOT yet *integrated over the visible spectral range
(380-780 nm) (from gendaylit man page), so we can't simply multiply it by
179 to get the illuminance value. We need to "break" the *"global
horizontal radiation" *into its RGB components and then use
(R*0.265+G*0.670+B*0.065)*179 to convert it into a illuminance value.

Haha, so you have a bible going? Good for you. I think many of us have something similar, in some form or fashion. I managed to document a couple of my notes online, here:

http://www.rumblestrip.org/interests/light/using-the-illum-material-for-smoother-renderings-in-radiance/
http://www.rumblestrip.org/interests/light/rtrace-multiprocessing-option-initial-test-results/

Francesco Anselmo's site is another repository:
http://www.bozzograo.net/radiance/index.php

Axel's stuff is awesome:
http://www.jaloxa.eu/resources/radiance/
(check out his "Radiance Cookbooks"!)

Giulio, I tried to link to your RadBlog (http://web.mac.com/geotrupes/iWeb/Main%20site/RadBlog/RadBlog.html), but I got a server error!

?and of course there is an effort underway to buff up the content right on the radiance-online.org site.

As Greg Ward has said: "everything about Radiance is documented, somewhere". Trick is when you find a nugget, save it someplace!

I would not put too much effort into understanding why it is 179 lm/W in 
Radiance. It usually really does not matter for you. You can use it as a 
constant as long as you are interested in photometric quantities, as in 
such case, you input and your output will be in lumens, not watt. So 
feed in by dividing by 179, read out by multiplying with the same. 
That?s it. This is completely unrelated to the "real" luminous efficacy 
of lamps, skies, stars (aka the sun...), which is not that easy to 
predict. So, whenever possible, I'd use the photometric units for input 
when I need photometric results. This means you are working with 
well-defined conversions.

Cheers, Lars.

Message-ID: <op.wqemlqnm7lwvrx@localhost.localdomain>

Dear all.
I just wanted to announce the availability of a new release of a set of  
scripts for the 3D content creation suite Blender - called LiVi - that  
acts as a pre/post-processor for Radiance. Version 2 includes animatable  
materials and geometry, dynamic daylight simulation capability and  
artificial lights via IES files.
Details and download at  
http://arts.brighton.ac.uk/research/office-for-spatial-research/projects2/livi
Version 0.2 should be fairly 'stable' but bug reports, questions and  
feature requests are most welcome. I can be contacted directly at  
R.Southall_at_brighton_dot_ac_dot_uk.
Regards
Ryan

Hi Ryan,

looks great! I am excited to see a Blender-based Radiance framework 
alive again!

I had a quick look into some of the demonastration videos. The pixel-ish 
shapre of the shadows and the term "receiver surface" - am I correct 
that you make use of a point grid for the calculations, not rpict & friends?

Cheers, Lars.

Hi Andy,

Interesting rule. Could you recommend further reading for my interest on how to get to the number 179? I would like to get a tiny grasp on the underlying principle to better understand.

Thanks a lot,
Aksel

Hi Aksel,
Unfortunately I don't have sources for this other than Greg's emails in the
vintage radiance digests (1990's).  Search these pages for "179", there are
several emails on this topic):
http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/digests_html/v2n5.1.html
http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/digests_html/v2n9.html
Best,
Andy

my take is, flux / power, therefore:

683 x v_lamda_norm x power       
---------------------
(780 - 380) x power

and power is =1, constant on the spectrum so it does not matter.
if you measure the area of V_lambda from a normalised chart and multiply by 683, you should get it.
I got 179.75, but the measure was a bit iffy :-)

Hi Philippe

According to this document (
http://brlcad.org/w/images/6/66/Converting_Geometry.pdf) BRD-CAD has a
converter to Wavefront OBJ format which is well supported in Radiance. From
OBJ you then use the Radiance tools obj2rad or obj2mesh to convert the
geometry into a Radiance native format. You have to experiment with these
tools to find a modeling and exporting workflow that suits your needs.

BRD-CAD also includes sample source code for non-CSG exporters (ie. face
based geometry like it's used in Radiance). It should not be too difficult
to write a native Radiance exporter based on this - if you know C, of
course.

Regards,
Thomas

Hi Thomas,

thanks for your feedback.

Unfortunately, the BRL-CAD converter you mention is not included in the MacOSX version of BRL-CAD 7.22 and you can only export the databases to ASCII (tcl language format) in that application.

As a result, I am going to switch modelers: either Blender or Rhino.

Cheers,

Philippe

Hello,

Is Radiance a good environment to learn basic ray-tracing?

I have looked at some of the tutorials online, but they seem to take it for granted that the reader is a lighting specialist or already has a ray-tracing background.

Cheers,

Philippe

Hi again

Radiance is probably not the best tool to start rendering or to explore
ray-tracing theory. It has since the beginnings a lot of optimisations to
be physically accurate but still reasonable fast. Because physical lighting
and daylighting applications were the main purpose other features like
shaders or caustics or particles are not well supported or not there at all.

On the other hand, Greg Ward has been supporting Radiance for a lifetime
and has provided very detailed documentation and comments via this mailing
list (or those that came before). There is also a very good documentation
on the concepts and algorithms used in Radiance included in the "Rendering
for Radiance" book. I don't know of any other renderer that has something
like that.

So, in terms of studying and understanding raytracing you can do worse than
Radiance. If you just want to create nice pictures you are probably better
of with other renderers.


Regards,
Thomas

Dear Phillipe,

PBRT, the software and the book, are a great way of learning how raytracers work and are relatively straightforward to modify (I'm a fairly experienced but self-taught C and C++ programmer and I could manage to add some features relevant to vision science, which is what I do for a living). Luxrender is a fork of PBRT (both are open source, as is RADIANCE) but luxrender has some more advanced features (especially in terms of volume properties). If you start with PBRT then it is a relatively painless move to luxrender (which integrates really well with a variety of modelling systems). I started with RADIANCE though, but mainly as a user rather than a programmer.

I still wish RADIANCE had a sophisticated volume system but I guess it is too far away from its primary purpose - there are a lot of people in vision science who use RADIANCE who'd use it! 

cheers,

Hi,

I am surprise to hear that the obj exporter should not be included in
the Mac distribution of BRL-CAD. Did you ask about this?

AFAIK there have even been plans to directly output as octree, but that
native Radiance support has never been added.

Cheers, Lars.

Hi Lars,

according to the BRL-CAD Converting_Geometry documentation PDF, the g-wave command lets you convert MGED object to .obj files. However, I could not find that command either in he BRL-CAD MGED 7.22 for MacOSX menus, nor in the Command Window help ("help g-view" return "no help found for g-view").

I should indeed have asked about it in the mailing list, but gave up on BRL-CAD as a modeler a few days ago when I encountered the "free" Rhino for MacOSX.

Best regards,

Philippe

Rhino and BRL-CAD are _very_ different tools. Rhino is a 3d-modeller
with advanced GUI and fancy buttons. BRL-CAD is basically a very
powerful CSG engine, with several frontends such as GUIs and command
line tools. If you need really have CSG modelling, possibly scripting,
BRL-CAD probably would be perfect, but for modelling some geometry with
a nice GUI Rhino (or Blender or wharever) is easier.

Just for completeness, you were probably just looking at the wrong
place. Just as with the radiance tools, you will not find the utilities
coming with BRL-CAD in any menu bars or Command Window Help. They are
commands, you can execute them if they are in your PATH, and you find
help using manpages.

Cheers, Lars.

Hi Lars,

I have finally found out how to convert a BRL-CAD database to an .OBJ file (which may later be used in Radiance) on MacOSX:

exec ./rel-7.22.0/bin/g-obj /Users/yourname/Desktop/BRLCad/test.g shape1.s > /Users/yourname/Desktop/BRLCad/shape1.obj

The resulting file looks like this:

# BRL-CAD generated Wavefront OBJ file (Units mm)
# BRL-CAD model: /Users/yourname/Desktop/BRLCad/test.g
# BRL_CAD objects: shape1.s
g shape1.s
v -2135.614650 123.542661 2545.726358
v -2122.058812 98.716591 2574.008958
v -2147.390442 44.812126 2581.262728
?

Dear Radiancers,

I have recently installed the LNBL precompiled binaries for Mac on a
Mountain Lion OS 10.8; and when trying to get the solar intensity of the
sky (*gendaylit - blah blah blah -O1*) it says "Segmentation fault: 11".
After that, I tried using the HEAD release from some days ago, on Linux,
and same deal "Segmentation fault (core dumpted)".

The same sky, without the O option does not return an error, but whenever I
put O1, O2 or O0, it throws back a segmentation fault.

Is this a known issue? what can I do to avoid it?

THANKS VERY MUCH

That's right Lars, it uses blender geometry to specify a grid of points and rtrace to calculate the numbers. Numbers are then expressed back in blender as coloured geometry.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Glare analysis of BSDF representation of
	light redirecting glass

Dear group,

I have a BSDF description of a light redirecting glass generated with  
the following command:
genBSDF -n 8 -c 20000 -r -ab 6 -ad 1 +f +b -g- millimeter -dim 12.49  
12.51 12.47449 12.52551 -3.158 0

We are using this file to understand the effective light distribution  
of a particular product as well as calculating DGP.   We are wondering  
if the number of samples (20000) used per each of the 145 klems  
directions would be sufficient to give an accurate representation of  
glare when looking at the scene description from inside the space?   
I've looked for published studies of comparative glare analysis using  
DGP and BSDF files but have come up short.

Thanks as always,
Chris

Hi Chris,

Changing the -c setting in genBSDF may result in a more accurate BSDF estimate, but it will not increase the resolution of the recorded distribution, which is defined by the 145x145 Klems basis.  Near normal incidence, the resolution is about 5 degrees, but increases to 15 or 20 degrees towards grazing angles.

To obtain a higher-resolution BSDF, you will need to switch to the tensor tree representation, which means using the -t4 option, probably '-t4 5' or '-t4 6' in your case.  The '-t4 5' setting will yield a BSDF with 1024 incoming and 1024 outgoing directions, which corresponds roughly to 2-degree resolution near normal incidence.  The higher setting of '-t4 6' gives you about twice the resolution, or 1-degree accuracy.  However, it does take about 4 times as long to calculate, and any tensor tree BSDF will take much longer to compute with genBSDF than the Klems basis.  Final rendering times should be similar, however.

Hope this helps!
-Greg

Hi German,
You need to have a space between O and 1, like this:  -O 1.
It used to be without a space, but I guess it was changed when it got added
to Radiance.
A segfault is not a good thing regardless, so we should probably do
something to avoid the segfault from mis-use.

Hi Greg,
Thank you for the response.  Do you think the BSDF estimate used would  
give a fair approximation of glare were it to be an issue?

Cheers!

Hi German,
You need to have a space between O and 1, like this:  -O 1.
It used to be without a space, but I guess it was changed when it got added to Radiance.
A segfault is not a good thing regardless, so we should probably do something to avoid the segfault from mis-use.

Dear Radiancers,

I have recently installed the LNBL precompiled binaries for Mac on a Mountain Lion OS 10.8; and when trying to get the solar intensity of the sky (gendaylit - blah blah blah -O1) it says "Segmentation fault: 11". After that, I tried using the HEAD release from some days ago, on Linux, and same deal "Segmentation fault (core dumpted)".

The same sky, without the O option does not return an error, but whenever I put O1, O2 or O0, it throws back a segmentation fault.

Is this a known issue? what can I do to avoid it?

THANKS VERY MUCH

German Molina

Hi Chris,

I think the higher resolution BSDF definitions, using the tensor tree
representation, will be important for accurate glare analysis.  In Andy and
Greg's presentation here:

http://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2011-berkeley-ca/presentations/day1/GW3_Multires_BSDF.pdf


on page 15 it compares a Klems BSDF with a 2X and 4X version, resulting in
the glare index dropping from 9% to 2%.  They show the Klems resolution is
fine for predicting annual quantities of light.  But we should be careful,
or really just use the tensor tree versions, when using them for glare
analysis.  The 145 Klems patches just spread the lumens too much,
particularly for systems that may have a more focused or directional optic
with sharp cut-offs.

Regards,
Zack

Dear group,

I would like to use 'pcomb' to clip yellow reflections (r,g,b=1,1,0)  
coming off of the same colored mirrored glass on a facade system and  
write to a new image such that only these reflections are shown.  I  
thought I'd pestered the group enough times on 'pcomb' matters to  
figure this out using the many great responses I've received over the  
years, but the right syntax is eluding me now.

As always,
Thanks!!

Hi Chris,

I'm not sure I understand what  you're after, exactly.  The following will turn all pixels black except those with a nearly-zero blue channel and non-zero red and green channels:

	pcomb -e 'and(a,b):if(a,b,a)' -e 'ypix=and(.01*ri(1)-bi(1),.01*gi(1)-bi(1))' -e 'ypix=is_yellow(ri(1),gi(1),bi(1))' \
			-e 'ro=if(ypix,1,0);go=if(ypix,1,0);bo=0' input.hdr > output.hdr

The and() expression returns positive if both red and green channels are more than 100 times the blue channel.  We can't compare blue to zero due to limitations in the accuracy of RGBE pixel values.

-Greg

Whoops -- bad edit on that line.  Try this one:

	pcomb -e 'and(a,b):if(a,b,a)' -e 'ypix=and(.01*ri(1)-bi(1),.01*gi(1)-bi(1))'  \

Thanks for the quick response Greg!

I'm using a specific, specular reflective color on each facade  
orientation of a building to better understand which curtain wall  
orientation is contributing to direct solar reflections on the street  
level. I'm trying to parse from each image in an annual, time lapse  
series the resultant patterns of reflection on the street separately  
for each orientation / color.

Running the script you sent I'm getting the following error:
is_yellow: undefined function

Thanks again,
Chris

Chris

Not directly responding to your question but here is an alternative
approche:

Instead of assigning different reflective colors to the facades you are
interested in you could just separate each facade direction into a
dedicated octree and run a simulation with white light. Renderings should
be fast if you restrict yourself to a single mirror reflection and no
ambient contribution.

You can then add up all the images for a single time step to get the
combined direct reflection. If you want to highlight a particular part you
can add/mix the individual pictures with a color in the post-process.

Regards,
Thomas

Message-ID: <D7908AF3-27E8-4E0E-8B72-1B2BF4989453@gmx.net>

Hi all,

I know that questions regarding the trans model tend to be either repetitive or lead to never-ending threads, however here is one more in the series.

I wanted to model a translucent surface, where I know really nothing about reflection. My idea was to keep Rd and Rs set to zero and only define the transmission. A simple example would be a surface with perfect lambertian transmission (Td=1, Ts=0) and no reflection at all (ok, hard to produce such a material, but I had reasons to separate transmission from reflection information). According to my understanding that would be:

void trans puretransmission
0
0
7	1	1	1
	0	0
	1	0

However, being lazy, I thought this might be a good time to try the widget for cross-checking. Which made me realize that Cr, Cb, Cg are not asked for. Instead, I seam to need a value > 0 for Rd, which means I can never achieve the above definition.

Am I just doing it wrong? Did this problem never arise because noone else wanted such a strange trans model? Or - which would give me a headache - is my understanding of Cr, Cg, Cb wrong? I always understood A1-A3=1-absorption(r,g,b).

Thank you, cheers, Lars.

Hi Lars,

without testing it I would say your trans specification exactly does what
you want (100% diffuse tranmission).  However, this is a border case where
the formulae for trans as in RwR on page 325/326 are not defined (dividing
0/0)...

Cheers,
David

Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance International Workshop 2013
Message-ID: <CD1DD838.18FDF%robert.guglielmetti@nrel.gov>

Greetings simulationists,

A couple months ago I polled these lists for consensus on dates for the
2013 International Radiance Workshop (which we are hosting here at NREL),
and we have settled on August 12-14 (Mon-Wed). The three-day format --
with tutorials on day one and presentations on days two and three -- seems
to have become the standard, so at this time I'd like to get some ideas
from you on what exactly the tutorial content should be.

In the past, the tutorial day has ranged from an HDR imaging workshop
(e.g. 2009-Boston), in-depth dives into new Radiance code additions (e.g.
2011-Berkeley), and in 2003 there were actually *two* tutorial tracks to
pick from: new feature deep dive with Greg Ward, and Radiance 101 with
John Mardaljevic (decisions, decisions!).

Now's our chance to flesh out what this year's tutorial day will look
like. A couple of folks contacted me off-list(s) to inquire about the
possibility of holding an OpenStudio training on that day, particularly
focusing on the use of OpenStudio for Radiance-informed energy analysis.
So, there's one idea. What else ya'll got? DAYSIM show & tell? HDR imaging
again? Feats of strength? Seriously, I'm interested in hearing your ideas
(and your intentions of attending) so we can decide if we're to have one
or more tracks, and what the content will be. So please, lemmeknow. I'll
probably gather up all of your responses and then put it to a vote.

Looking forward to seeing many of you in August!

- Googs

P.S. We will definitely offer tours of our new energy efficient campus
buildings as well. We have a 330,000 ft^2 net zero office building (where
the workshop will be held), super-efficient (and daylit) parking garage
and cafeteria, and, by the time of the workshop, a grid-scale test
facility with the most energy-efficient petascale supercomputer in the
world (PUE <= 1.06). And we have lots of mountains right next door!

Message-ID: <CAOG+NiwhUFuEWCoKa+Zd_azdwvOCCoUOg+Ge=a-gZMbHt9da8Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Everyone,

A long time ago I developed a utility to interactively visualize data
contained in BSDF files.  I found it extremely useful, so I shared it with
a few others who also found it useful.  We decided to release it publicly
and now, a year later, I am *officially* allowed to share it.

You can download installers for windows and linux here:
https://www.radiance-online.org/download-install/bsdf-viewer
If you want to use it on Linux let me know, I can send you something that
you can test for me.

It was written using processing which is Java based.  Processing is maybe
not the best for this, but I started there with something very simple, and
as things tend to go it got complex pretty quick.

The mac version supports tensor tree BSDFs the Windows version only
supports Klems BSDFs.

I hope you find it useful.

Andy

PS - It's a bit rough around the edges, sorry.  Please report bugs that
prevent you from being able to use it and I will try to fix them quickly.

interactive viewer also using Processing to visualise Radiance geometry,

	3phase method implementation
Message-ID: <CAF-iH4+wEEomSqXBO2UBdwiusJQVRGvi+5ni-0Lp1dhoDECNjw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Radiancers,

Since I have been posting here just problems that many of you have kindly
read and answered, I decided to publish a pre-version of my MSc project,
hoping that it can be useful for some of you.

My project is to develop an as-friendly-as-possible tool for the design and
evaluation of the performance of shading systems for different facades,
weathers, etc. The idea is to design in SketchUp, then use Radiance to
assess the Visible Transmittance (genBSDF), the solar heat gain coefficient
(genSHGC, still in development), and to use the Three-Phase Method (I have
heard it is becoming a more-than-three-phases method...??) to compute the
Illuminance distribution as well as the solar gains, for each window.

For now I have managed to export geometry with their respective modifiers
in an organized way (the standard Sunlite directories), and create a
Scenario file that has the information of the systems "installed" on each
window, and the normal direction of it. That way, a script called SL_presim
generates the Daylight and View Matrices for each window, storing them in
the appropriate directory, for a posterior SL_sim script to simulate the
year out of an EnergyPlus weather file.

Anyway, you can see a 3 min. video
HERE<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=er8gm1kusvQ&feature=youtu.be>,
I had trouble with the audio.... and a web site
HERE<https://www.sites.google.com/site/sunliteproject/home>
.

THANKS EVERYONE,

German

PS: Just for you to know, for now, both the video and the webpage can only
be seen by the people who have the Link.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Rendered mountains
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.1301181014450.17886@zaxxon.gpcc.itd.umich.edu>

Hey Radiance folks,

I've written a pile of scripts to convert USGS elevation data into 
watertight trimeshes for 3D printing. While doing so, I had to make sample 
renderings of lots of mountains. So, if you like mountains and like 
Radiance, you might like these images.

http://www.shapeways.com/shops/TinyMtn

I hope the renderings are good enough to warrant the shameless plug.

Details:

My own rockpng program converted the 16-bit PNG heightfield to a trimesh. 
Meshlab-server did some automatic processing on the mesh. I used GMSH to 
generate text and Carve to union that text with the model (all F/OSS). 
Models are 500k-900k triangle Wavefront .obj files (easy to read and 
write), converted to Radiance mesh format for rendering. The room was 
modeled after my living room (down to including two large green trees out 
the two windows), and rendering used an imagemap of my stone coffee table 
and some rpict depth-of-field with -aa 0 -ab 3 -ad 16 for ambient settings 
and -ps 1 -u+ -w- -lw 1.e-3 -ds 0.2 -dj 0.7 for rendering. The raw .hdr 
images were dropped to 8bpp first, then reduced 4:1 for the site (less 
noise doing it in that order).

Very cool, Mark. When you hook a brotha up with a Long's Peak model, I'm all in.

It'll be cool if some people with the skills to do so, airbrush these to look like snow capped mountains. Bryce Canyon would look awesome all redded up too!

Models are 500k-900k triangle Wavefront .obj files (easy to read and write), converted to Radiance mesh format for rendering. The room was modeled after my living room (down to including two large green trees out the two windows), and rendering used an imagemap of my stone coffee table and some rpict depth-of-field with -aa 0 -ab 3 -ad 16 for ambient settings and -ps 1 -u+ -w- -lw 1.e-3 -ds 0.2 -dj 0.7 for rendering. The raw .hdr images were dropped to 8bpp first, then reduced 4:1 for the site (less noise doing it in that order).

Apropos to this, I am working on an annual sky matrix generator based on Ian Ashdown's re-implementation of gendaylit (Perez sky model), which should streamline the process considerably.  It will be called gendaymtx, and is checked in but currently undergoing testing.  Last week, I checked in a new version of dctimestep that accepts an annual sky matrix in addition to single timestep vectors.

Cheers,
-Greg

Dear German,

This plugin looks interesting. However, I can't find any download links.
The Sunlite website's download page says that nothing is available.

Did you release it yet? Let us know where to download it when you do; I'd
love to check it out =).

Also, I don't see what software license you'll be using, but if possible,
please don't encrypt your .rb files!

Regards,
Anthony

I should mention that I uploaded a new version for Mac yesterday (v1.3)
that fixes some issues with tensor trees.  So if you have a
pre-announcement version for Mac, you should download a new one.

Also I have a few example BSDFs here if you want to try BSDF viewer but
don't want to generate a BSDF yourself:

That's great!  Thanks for sharing Andy.

I've tried uncompressing the sample BSDF .xml files you linked too,  
but can't seem to get legible files after unzipping them on MAC OSX  
10.5?  Anyone else tried successfully?

The links for the BSDF files were broken.  I've just fixed them.  You
should be able to download them now.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Trans material
Message-ID: <1358798254.58084.YahooMailNeo@web171303.mail.ir2.yahoo.com>

Dear list,

Yet another question on the trans material.

The question is on the design of a roof in an exhibition hall. The first layer is facing the outside air, the next layer is approx. 20cm below and the third layer is another few meters below. All 3 layers are built up the diffuse transmitting glass.

We have built all 3 layers of glass with material Trans, cf. the data below:?

Cr Cg Cb Rd Rs Sr Td Ts 
0,1 0,1 0,1 0,1 0,08 0,02 0,5 0 
A1 A2 A3 A4 A5 A6 A7 
0,65 0,65 0,65 0,08 0,02 0,83 0,00 

The rendering parameters are (in ecotec):

-dp=512
-ar=22
-ms=0.74
-ds=.3
-dt=.1
-dc=.5
-dr=1
-sj=.7
-st=.1
-ab=12
-af=RCP.amb
-aa=.2
-ad=400
-as=64
-av=0.01 0.01 0.01
-lr=6
-lw=.002

My question is when rendering the scene and looking up towards the roof you can see right through the panes as they are not translucent but clear glass. One can clearly see outline of the top window and connection between the roof and the walls which is rather unexpected.

Are there a logical?explanation?for this or what could be the case here? Should I have modeled the inner layer as an illum source?

Any input is appreciated :)

Hi Per,

You should not be seeing straight through the surface.  I did a test using your parameters, and could not see through such a trans material.

Are you sure that what you are seeing is not the shadows cast by the beams?  Have you double-checked your geometry to make sure all the materials are correctly assigned and the surfaces where you expect them?  What happens when you substitute an opaque material for the trans?

Could it be that you are visualising illluminance?
If so the trans and glass surfaces are ignored and not shown?
hence the roof outside.

Hi Per.

a side note on your material definition. Ts of zero is difficult to achieve for transmission with real glass, as that would be a perfect lambertian diffuser. Did you do any test or measurement confirming this? You can see some examples of real world translucent glasses (sanded, or with scattering films applied) on Peter's BME site: http://www.pab.eu/gonio-photometer/demodata/bme/

A quick test I tend to do is pointing a small laser pointer at the glass (be careful, there may be strong reflection from the glass which you probably do not want to reach your eye) held just one cm onver a piece of paper. If you see a smooth gradient, it is a perfect diffuser. If you still see the dot of the pointer, with a smooth gradient around, you have a mixture of diffuse and specular transmission. That ratio could get measured using an intergrating sphere, or you could have the BSDF measured.

Cheers, Lars.

Hallo ,

I am trying to get stable and accuracy values using different parameters
for rtrace options. I reached -ab 7 -ad 32768 -lw 2e-12.

But everytime i make higher parameters for ab or ad, the results are
getting slightly higher for points with low illuminance but higher values
for the ones with high illuminance. Should i proceed with higher parameters
to get a saturate results?!

So if anyone have this problem before, your feedback will be appreciated!

thxs in advance.

-ab X increases the number of bounces that will be considered in the diffuse-indirect calculation. So increasing it will lead to higher results, at any time. However, this increase will become less and, at a certain point, insignificant. It is up to you to decide when this point is reached. In a setup with dark surfaces and a lot of direct light reaching your sensor, -ab 1 may be enough, in a scene where light reaches the sensor only by reflections due to bright, diffuse surfaces, -ab 3 and more will be needed. Do a plot of the sensor value against the -ab setting to find where the increase becomes insignificant.

-ar X increases the number of sample directions when the indirect-diffuse calculation sends out random samples. Your setting is very high... and this makes the process probably very slow. Usually, -ad is set together with -as. Making use of genBSDF to replace e.g. detailed geometry (which would require to be "scanned" at a high angular resolution) in the indirect-diffuse calculation may allow you to use lower settings. Another good way to achieve quick results is to lower -ad and increase -c. This does basically the same as -ad does for the first ambient bounce (where the impact on the sensor tends to be highest). The lower -ad however speeds up subsequent bounces, and should help you decrease rendering times especially with high -ab settings. Again you should find out when results start to stabilize. This time it would be worth finding the level of noise against the -ad/-c value. Mark Stock suggested the file-size of the compressed images as an indicator for noise: http://markjstock.org/radmisc/aa0_ps1_test/final.html This works if you produce images, not single point sensors. Note that at that time, the -c parameter was not available yet, so he had to achieve oversampling by increasing the resolution. The histogram tools of Radiance may also be helpful.

I hope this somehow helps. Cheers, Lars.

Hi all,

Hope I am getting how this works right...

The question regarding the Trans material previously posted by Per was
basically posted on my behalf and therefore I will take the liberty to just
build upon that thread.

With respect to the difference between generating illuminance and luminance
pictures you of course have a very valid point. However, I am simulating a
model with three layers of Trans material and I would expect that your view
from inside and outwards even when considering illuminance levels would be
diffused (being filtered through three layers) ? Maybe I am missing
something?
What happens in between layers of Trans material (inter-reflections
etc.) and what are the internal surface properties?

Thank you for all you help so far!

Best regards,

Hi Martin!

First, it would help to know whether you experience this with luminance maps, too.

For illluminance/irradiance any transmissive surface is tricky, as the observer may expect different results.

What -ab setting do you use? -ab <3 would only let the specular transmission trough your multilayer diffuser, if I am not completely wrong... And that should make it appear like a dark (+ reflection) clear glass? I never tried this kind of stacking.

Cheers, Lars.

Hi Martin,

Any trans materials will be ignored if you use the -i rendering option.  If you didn't use -i+, then you shouldn't see through a trans with Ts=0.

Between layers of trans materials with both diffuse reflection and transmission, many interreflected rays will be traced.

Hi Rob,

I once did that going via mgf and vrml:

rad2mgf scene.rad > scene.mgf
mgf2inv -vrml scene.mgf > scene.wrl

This vrml file can then be imported to e.g. Rhino. However, I did not get
different layers for different materials, but I also didn't look into that,
because I just wanted to check the geometry...

Cheers,
David

Thanks David,

I was just writing an update myself:

I found that Francesco Anselmo wrote a nice radiance to obj script in Python:

Hi Rob,

You can convert from Radiance to MGF, then from there to Inventor format, which someone might read.  (rad2mgf followed by mgf2inv)  Inventor is supported at some level by Autodesk.

Thanks all.

For the record, I used Francesco's script to go from radiance to obj, then
imported that into Blender and saved as a 3ds, which I was then able to
import into SketchUp. Seems to have worked...

Hey Rob,

It had to happen some day....

rad2mgf perhaps gets you part way, not sure if mgf2inv might get you the 
next step?

I am currently looking into the use of hdr images and their use with evalglare. 

Can anyone tell me (before I launch into it) whether it's possible to use the 'standard' lens on my camera or does evalglare require a hemispherical image as an input?

Quick to check I know, but also quick to mail all you lovely people!  :)

Hi Erik,

Short answer is you can use a non-hemispherical lens, as long as you take an eye illuminance reading as well. Still, if there are glare sources beyond the field of view of your lens, you're simply not going to get accurate results out of evalglare. I suggest you read up on the evalglare documentation, for starters?

Dear List,

I'm hoping for some help as I'ma  bit lost here.

I have a simple test scene with some light sources in it.

The scene is entirely described using radiance meshes (obj2mesh) and the
light sources are instead sent as polygons.

All the files are called In the *.rif file and then I simply run:

	rad test.rif

the output in the console is:

	oconv materials.rad test.rad > test.oct
		set ROPT=-dp 512 -ar 31 -ms 0.49 -ds .3 -dt .1 -dc .5
-dr 1 -ss 1 -st .1 -ab 2 - af test.amb -aa .15 -ad 800 -as 128 -av 10 10
10 -lr 8 -lw 1e-4 -ad 2048 -as 1024 -dr 100 -lr 48 -av 0 0 0 


and then nothing...
no errors, no warnings and (most importantly!) no image!
The computer does not even hang...

Can anybody offer an explanation?

Thanks a million in advance,

Giovanni

Hi Giovanni,

I suspect that your test.rad (or materials.rad) file has a line of the form:

!some_script

that is hanging because it is attempting to read from the standard input.  Whatever script produced the ROPT= line is the one hanging up oconv.

Thanks for the suggestion Greg; unfortunately that's not the case as the
script does not hang there and the just goes to the next line of the
batch file.

What's even funnier is that the same files run from another machine...
...which is what will happen for tonight and tomorrow I'll try to figure
out what's wrong with mine...

Still open to suggestions though! ;)

Thanks 

Giovanni

Hi Giovanni,

Not sure on this, as I do not remember if there are issues with spaces 
around the "=" sign. Your rif file has

    VARIABILITY = MEDIUM

all the other parameter names have the = sign right after the name, so 
what about

    VARIABILITY= MEDIUM

In my own defense, rad should be robust to different line endings and spaces around variables, etc.  I still think the problem is in the scene or material files.  What happens when you run oconv on the command line, as opposed to doing it through rad?  If it hangs, try redirecting input from an empty file just to be sure it isn't a stdin hang.

As a test reduce INDIRECT to 1, QUALITY to LOW, and the RESOLUTION to 230 x
150. Perhaps you are just not patient enough.

Message-ID: <CAB61kRe-YrLr09-ykLm0+95-Fic=M8CMq+9ppnyurGjbEyWPzw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Thank you all for your help - is was very beneficial.

You were right that it appears to be "perfectly" diffused when considering
luminance. However, just for future references, isn't it possible to
evaluate the illuminance incident on a surface with trans or glass material
applied?
Greg: with respect to the -i rendering option or not, I must admit I simply
do not know enough to have a sufficient grasp on this. As I read it from
the manual -i basically determined if you consider radiance or irradiance
and therefore subsequently if you consider illuminance or luminance. Do I
understand that correctly?

Sorry for all the potential trivial and basic questions and thank you for
taking the time to answer them!

Hi Martine!

> You were right that it appears to be "perfectly" diffused when considering luminance. However, just for future references, isn't it possible to evaluate the illuminance incident on a surface with trans or glass material applied?

You can do so by piping "sensor locations/directions" into rtrace and use the -I+ switch. That way, you calculate irradiance at that location without having a visible surface in place. You can get one value for a given location by e.g. piping one location / direction vector, e.g. echo "0 0 0 0 0 1" | rtrace -I+ (all other parameters...). Or you can generate a grid of such values, eventuelly forming an "irradiance image", by using vwrays to generate the locations / directions for you. This is much more flexible then rpict -i, which always depends on a surface in your scene. Have a quick look at Axel Jacob's tutorial to see some examples.

Cheers, Lars.

Hi Martin,

Your understanding of the -i option is correct in the basics, but there is a "hack" in the code to ignore glass and other typically transparent surfaces.  Otherwise, you would end up calculating illuminance on surfaces that generally don't care about illuminance.  And in the case of your diffuse trans material, it is unclear whether you would care more about illuminance on the inside (which would be the default reporting for interior views), or illuminance arriving at the other side.  Do you see the problem?

Lars' solution of using rtrace to compute the location then a second rtrace to compute irradiance (or illuminance) using -I+ is the best, because it gives you full control over what gets reported.  John Mardaljevic has used this to good effect in several specialized cases, which he has described here:

	http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/Notes/jm_technote_02.pdf

As Lars mentions, Axel Jacobs also has some great tutorials:

	http://www.jaloxa.eu/resources/radiance/documentation/docs/radiance_tutorial.pdf

	http://www.jaloxa.eu/resources/radiance/documentation/docs/radiance_cookbook.pdf

Just generally speaking, you're looking for a command of the form:

	vwrays -ff -vf view.vf -x 1000 -y 1000 | rtrace -ff -h -opN scene.oct | rtrace -ffc -I+ `vwrays -d -vf view.vf -x 1000 -y 1000` [rendering options] scene.oct > result.hdr

If you want to speed up the second calculation on a multiprocessing machine, add a -n option to the second rtrace with the number of parallel processes. Be sure to specify an ambient file with -n if -ab > 0, or you won't see much speedup.

Cheers,
-Greg

Hi Everyone,

I'm attempting to use Radiance to generate images for presentation in a 
large VR space - the system currently uses a game-engine but I'm not 
happy with the quality of the rendering as I'm interested in the visual 
perception of shadows and shading.

The space* is approximately a 6x6x2metre volume with a stereo 
(polarized) screen at one end, the screen is roughly 6x2 metres.


I want to present a rendered scene as if it lies behind the screen, i.e. 
the screen is a window through which we view a rendered object. The 
viewer can then walk through the space and I can present updated views 
relative to the current viewing location (I have 6 DOF head tracking). 
Obviously this requires a lot of offline rendering and a relatively 
narrow movement range - just to cut the rendering overhead.

It's easy enough to see how I might render images for presentation when 
viewer and the viewing target are positioned centrally within the world, 
i.e. looking straight forward towards the middle of the screen. What I 
don't understand is how I render scenes for when the viewer has move 
off-centre to left or right. Firstly, perspective is going to make one 
side of the screen smaller than the other, I'd need to correct this so 
that the screen image fits on the actual screen.

I think I could build-in some markers that denote the corners of the 
large VR screen, then stretch the image so that these markers lie on the 
corners of the screen - this seems a little clumsy.

Is there a better way?

George

Hi George,

This seems a very interesting project! Does this include also trying to simulate the high dynamic range found in real life?

For your problem I guess that the options -vs and -vl might help you.
From the rpict manpage:
	
-vs 
Set the view shift to val. This is the amount the actual image will be shifted to the right of the specified view. This is option is useful for generating skewed perspectives or rendering an image a piece at a time. A value of 1 means that the rendered image starts just to the right of the normal view.

Set the view lift to val. This is the amount the actual image will be lifted up from the specified view, similar to the ?vs option.


Hope this helps,

Subject: [Radiance-general] Rendering for off-centre presentation in a VR lab

Hi Everyone,

I'm attempting to use Radiance to generate images for presentation in a large VR space - the system currently uses a game-engine but I'm not happy with the quality of the rendering as I'm interested in the visual perception of shadows and shading.

The space* is approximately a 6x6x2metre volume with a stereo
(polarized) screen at one end, the screen is roughly 6x2 metres.


I want to present a rendered scene as if it lies behind the screen, i.e. 
the screen is a window through which we view a rendered object. The 
viewer can then walk through the space and I can present updated views 
relative to the current viewing location (I have 6 DOF head tracking). 
Obviously this requires a lot of offline rendering and a relatively 
narrow movement range - just to cut the rendering overhead.

It's easy enough to see how I might render images for presentation when 
viewer and the viewing target are positioned centrally within the world, 
i.e. looking straight forward towards the middle of the screen. What I 
don't understand is how I render scenes for when the viewer has move 
off-centre to left or right. Firstly, perspective is going to make one 
side of the screen smaller than the other, I'd need to correct this so 
that the screen image fits on the actual screen.

I think I could build-in some markers that denote the corners of the 
large VR screen, then stretch the image so that these markers lie on the 
corners of the screen - this seems a little clumsy.

Is there a better way?

George

Kudos to Giovanni for providing the correct answer to your perspective problem.

Do check out the rholo program, which was designed for interactive rendering with unconstrained views.  The quality may not be up to your standards, but it does handle specular reflections and everything else in Radiance.

Best,
-Greg

Sounds like a nice project! Please note that depending on the number and
complexity of objects in your scene the rendering times for Radiance may
not be suitable for real time viewing. If you hit this problem you can
pre-render textures for your objects in Radiance that capture the lighting
situation. You then just have to map the rendered textures on your object
and are free to use your game engine to provide the perspective image
necessary for your projection.

I don't have URLs at hand but there were some presentations on this in past
Radiance workshops.

Regards,
Thomas

Thanks Giovanni and Greg,

I'll try those rpict options, they sound just like what I need.

I wont be using high dynamic range, which means I may have to simulate a 
more muted illumination pattern - more like the usual Scottish weather!

RHolo would be cool! Currently everything is visualized in code I've 
written in matab, as I'm using a PC with mingGW...

Thanks Thomas,

Don't worry, I'm planning to pre-render everything, partly because I 
need high quality renders and don't have access to super-fast machinery. 
Also because in one manipulation I need to present items with shadows 
from different items, which requires some post-processing.

Best wishes,

George

Message-ID: <CAF-iH4+bzAoB53V+r+V2Ps9Sb3yGGMwNh08G8Ft0+k_JuUnQgA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list;

I have been using the genBSDF a lot lately, and just today I decided to use
both cores of my computer. Long story short, I tried the "-n" option
directly on genBSDF, on the "r" options alone, in the "r" options with
ambient file; nevertheless, I got my best results using just one core.

What is correct (optimal) way of using parallel processing in genBSDF?

THANKS VERY MUCH

Hi Germ?n,

It should be fastest using the genBSDF -n option directly, rather than putting it in your -r option list.  Using the latest version of genBSDF from the HEAD, the -n option generally works pretty well in my experience.  In cases where the geometry and light interactions are very simple, there may not be much gain as the calculation is constrained by file i/o operations.  This is particularly true under Windows, which are forced to use ASCII rather than binary files due to the ages-old lack of any sensible end-of-file detection on that system.

Cheers,
-Greg

Thanks Greg!

Well, maybe I will see a difference when trying more complex geometries. I
am using the official Mac LBNL release (could not compile the Head one);
just for you to know.

In the other hand; I am trying to see the difference between the BSDF
generated when modeling a glazing using the "glass" primitive given by
Optics; and the BRTDfunc given by the same program. For now everything
suggest that the second one will need much more rays to converge... am I
right?

I am expecting to see difference in the reflecting part, not in the
transmitted part.

THANKS VERY MUCH

The HEAD should compile smoothly on the Mac, since that's what I'm using.  There were a number of bugs fixed in genBSDF and related procedures since the official 4.1 release, and you really should be using the HEAD for that.  Also, the -n option works much better in the latest code using the new rcontrib, although I expect you still won't see much of a boost for simple geometries.

If you use the Klems matrix to represent a BSDF, it won't resemble the output of Optics due to the spreading of the direct component in the former.  You might do a little better with a tensor tree representation, but a BSDF data file will never live up to a material model when it comes to sharp peaks.

Cheers,

Using the latest version of genBSDF from the HEAD, the -n option generally works pretty well in my experience.  In cases where the geometry and light interactions are very simple, there may not be much gain as the calculation is constrained by file i/o operations.  This is particularly true under Windows, which are forced to use ASCII rather than binary files due to the ages-old lack of any sensible end-of-file detection on that system.

Hello,
I see that Radiance is using a short formula for solar position in sun.c.
 I checked the results provided by gensky for various locations and times
to the solar calculator provided by NOAA at
http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/grad/solcalc/.
I understand that most Radiance applications do not require an extremely
accurate position that more detailed formulas provide, but the difference I
find is many degrees (27 degrees for altitude at Cape Town) so I want to
confirm that this is working as expected.

I also see that the Radiance code mentions Julian date but without a Julian
date formula - the input seems to be the Gregorian day and month. If I add
a Julian date conversion, the difference between the algorithms is even
greater.

Hi Jeff,

Part of the discrepancy you're seeing is from using negative values  
for the longitude and meridian settings in Gensky which wants positive  
values for western longitudes.
Repeating your gensky command using positive values:
gensky 01 29 15 +s -a 44.97 -o 93.25 -m 90

I get:
Solar altitude and azimuth: 17.8 38.4

Also I think you may have written down the NOAA azimuth result  
incorrectly for Minneapolis. Rather than 28.58 I think it should read  
218.58 (which is around what I got at the same site). When you  
subtract 180 degrees from 218.58 you get 38.58.

Hi Jeff,

The NOAA calculator takes degrees east longitude, whereas gensky expects degrees WEST longitude.  (Same for the standard meridian.)

Try it; you'll find much better agreement.  (I get within half a degree for Cape Town using your parameters.)

It's confusing all the different standards, isn't it?

Cheers,
-Greg

Hi everyone, 

I 'm using gendaylit function to generate sky with visible spectrum only. I introduce horizontal direct irradiance and horizontal diffuse irradiance (-G parameter) which are computed from horizontal global irradiance (meteo data : full spectrum).

I don't understand why sky irrandiance in Radiance is approximatively 60% of horizontal global irradiance. In my mind, the visible spectrum is approximatively 40-45% of full spectrum, is it wrong?

Example gendaylit command : 
	
	gendaylit 6 21 12:00GMT -a 46.51 -o -6.56 -m -15 -G 500 200

Thanks for your answer.

Cheers
Julien

Hi German,

if you model clear glass, (almost) all transmission is direct. This works very efficient for the glass material type, but in theory requires infinite resolution for a BSDF if you want the models to match. I think there are not many cases where both the BRTDfunc and the glass model as given by Optics make sense, but Optics will not take the decision.

So for anything that you do not have any scatter defined, I'd use glass (dielectric if not thin and to be approximated as one surface).

BRTDfunc output is fine for anything scattering with the limitations of BRTDfunc in the ambient calculation. That is where Window6 comes into play, exporting the BSDF model which is really fully supported by Radiance - though it has a limited resolution.

Cheers, Lars.

> In the other hand; I am trying to see the difference between the BSDF generated when modeling a glazing using the "glass" primitive given by Optics; and the BRTDfunc given by the same program. For now everything suggest that the second one will need much more rays to converge... am I right?

Message-ID: <4CCD6425-B096-44B6-8B39-69741B53E1AD@gmx.net>

Hi all,

while it is one of the most fundamental material types in Radiance, dielectric is hardly used in simulations with Radiance as far as I know. I once or twice had to use it, but never for critical parts of a model.

Now, I need to find the irradiance in (!) a glass pane on the second surface S2 in this simple sketch:

|        |
|        |
| o      |    * source
| sensor |
|        |

S2      S1

The glass material applied to a flat surface through S1 obviously does not work here, as it includes reflection at S2 into the plane through S1. That would lead to an underestimate of about 4% at normal incidence. What I did is to model S1 as a dielectric, S2 as plastic, and ran the rtrace command with the -i switch, location as marked by the o-letter in the sketch and the view vector towards S2.

- My first question - is this a valid model in Radiance, with a volume having a dielectric interface on one, a plastic surface on the other side?

- Second question, can I expect rtrace to calculate a valid irradiance reading under these circumstances?

- Third question, and that is funny - how do I find the transmissivity parameters for a glass, as dielectric would expect them, if I have transmission T measured?

If someone here could share some insight how to find a valid dielectric description from a typical transmission measurement for the visible spectrum, that would be of great help for me....

Cheers and TIA,
Lars.

Hi Julien,

Using  the default option (-O 0 ) gendaylit "transfers" the solar 
radiation into visible radiation, using a luminance efficacy model.
Therefore the "sky irradiation" (=equals visible irradiation) differs 
also from situation to situation. The luminance efficacy of the sun is 
much lower than for the sky and this is taken into account by the model.

So for your case

gendaylit 6 21 12:00GMT -a 46.51 -o -6.56 -m -15 -G 500 200

you get
425 W/m? visible radiation

if you use

gendaylit 6 21 12:00GMT -a 46.51 -o -6.56 -m -15 -O 1 -G 500 200
you get
695 W/m? solar radiation  which is +- the input radiation of 
500+200=700W/m?

So the results are as expected.

The included luiminance efficacy model works properly within gendaylit - 
at least a recently internal performed validation study on measured data 
showed this.

By the way, my colleague will announce later today a major update of 
gendaylit, which have some significant improvements included.

Cheers,

Jan

Hi Julien,

you did not forget to apply the skyfunc generated by gendaylit to a glow modifier and use that with a source object? How do you calculate the irradiance in Radiance? -ab is greater than 0?

Cheers, Lars.

People,

As Greg said, the HEAD compiled correctly this time... maybe it was just
the version I tried.

Lars,

What I am trying to do is to actually compare the BSDF given in Klems basis
by WINDOW, and the one generated in the same basis by genBSDF; based on the
materials from Optics. Since I am not comparing the lighting levels; I
understand that the resolution should not be a problem, right?

Now thinking that *"there are not many cases where both the BRTDfunc and
the glass model as given by Optics make sense, but Optics will not take the
decision"*, is there any documentation about modeling "modern glazing
systems"?; for example, I understand that BRTDfunc are oriented to one
side... How can one deal with the inter-reflections between two glazings?

THANKS VERY MUCH

Dear RADIANCE users,

gendaylit:

we are happy to announce an updated version (from now on we have version 
numbers, this release is called 2.0) of gendaylit. It is already 
integrated in the Radiance CVS system, which means you can download it 
with the HEAD-release. You can find it also on our web-site here ( 
http://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/radiance ) in a zip file, together with a 
Windows-version.

Version 2.0 has the following additional features:

if any of the Perez parameters are out of the model parameters, the 
parameters are set to the border and an output is produced (+ a warning 
message) 
If gendaylit is used with weather files, the specified instantaneous 
points of time may be incorrect.This error occurs due to the fact that 
measurement results are frequently defined for time intervals, not for 
specific points of time.Although gendaylit is working correctly, this may 
lead to wrong outputs especially at low sun altitudes. The "-l min_angle" 
option avoids these errors by returning zero values if the sun altitude is 
below min_angle degrees over the horizon. The default value is zero; the 
recommended number for min_angle in the case of using weather files is 1 
degree. 
As the new gendaylit version does not depend any more on additional files 
(except the further processing of the gendaylit outputon perezlum.cal, of 
course), it is more stable than the version before. 
Warning messages that are written to stdout, especially at too low sun 
altitudes or at too high or too low sky brightness or clearness, can be 
suppressed by the -w option. 
The -v option disappeared. 
The output during the night has changed: the error message is replaced by 
zero numbers for the Perez coefficients. 
The sun coordinates are also calculated when the sun is below the horizon. 

The man page has been updated.

This updated version has been validated on a measured annual weather data 
set - all possible radiation/illuminance inputs have been successfully 
proven and show high accordance to the measured values.

Please give feedback to wendelin.sprenger at ise.fraunhofer.de if something 
is
not working properly.

evalglare:

there is also a new version available on the ISE server ( 
http://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/radiance ).
There are some performance improvements included + some small bugs 
removed.
The current version is now v1.11.

Jeff,

If you're willing to go a little farther, you can get more accurate with a 
little work. Install libnova, an astronomical library, and then 
genutahsky, my full-color Radiance sky module. Sun positions use a pretty 
intense calculation, and are even color-shifted at low angles based on 
turbidity.

Dear Lars,

I had the same problem approximately two years ago: rtrace -I does not 
give you the right answer when being applied after a dielectric surface. 
With the -i option of rtrace, I do not have any experience.
I suggest a workaround for your problem. As you did, I would chose a 
dielectric surface followed by a plastic surface. For rtrace -I inside a 
material, in theory the integral

E = int [ L cos(theta_m) d Omega_m ]

has to be calculated, m naming the angles inside the material. 
Unfortunately, at least the specular path does not remember the light 
refraction for the rtrace -I calculation. However, if you substitute the 
angles in the integral by the old ones before the material, rtrace -I 
works. The substitution theta_m=arcsin(n1/n2*theta), including 
cos(theta_m)=sqrt[1-sin^2(theta_m)], leads to a complicated integral that 
finally can be simplified to

E = n1^2/n2^2 int [ L cos(theta) d Omega ]

rtrace -I only calculates this integral. With the correction factor 
n1^2/n2^2, the rtrace -I results can be applied. 
The ambient path, however, seems to work perfectly without any correction 
factor.
I haven't done any research on what is exactly going on in the source 
codes. However, the results are fine.
I do not have an answer for your third question.

Cheers,
Wendelin

Hi all,

while it is one of the most fundamental material types in Radiance, 
dielectric is hardly used in simulations with Radiance as far as I know. I 
once or twice had to use it, but never for critical parts of a model.

Now, I need to find the irradiance in (!) a glass pane on the second 
surface S2 in this simple sketch:

|        |
|        |
| o      |    * source
| sensor |
|        |

S2      S1

The glass material applied to a flat surface through S1 obviously does not 
work here, as it includes reflection at S2 into the plane through S1. That 
would lead to an underestimate of about 4% at normal incidence. What I did 
is to model S1 as a dielectric, S2 as plastic, and ran the rtrace command 
with the -i switch, location as marked by the o-letter in the sketch and 
the view vector towards S2.

- My first question - is this a valid model in Radiance, with a volume 
having a dielectric interface on one, a plastic surface on the other side?

- Second question, can I expect rtrace to calculate a valid irradiance 
reading under these circumstances?

- Third question, and that is funny - how do I find the transmissivity 
parameters for a glass, as dielectric would expect them, if I have 
transmission T measured?

If someone here could share some insight how to find a valid dielectric 
description from a typical transmission measurement for the visible 
spectrum, that would be of great help for me....

Cheers and TIA,
Lars.

Hi Lars,

The physics of this situation is unusual, and the Radiance source code does apply a correction for the "solid angle ratio" caused by lensing at the surface.  However, Radiance doesn't track source directions properly inside a dielectric or through a refracting object -- it naively sends rays in a straight line towards the source, missing it in cases where significant refraction occurs.  This is why a straight ambient calculation works but the direct calculation does not.

Cheers,
-Greg

As to your third question, the transmission is a function of reflection (which is a function of angle) and the amount of dielectric material the ray has passed through, which undergoes exponential absorption with distance.  This is why transmission coefficients are given as a ratio to distance traveled, and there is a RAY struct member to hold this quantity called cext (for coefficient of extinction).  Beware that there are a few conditions under which this coefficient will not be properly accounted for, such as a surface and a light or glow source both within a refracting medium.  Since the ray never crosses any material boundary on its way to the source, it doesn't even know it's in an absorbing medium.  The same holds true for the "mist" type, which is why it's important for light sources and other significant contributors to lie outside the mist volumes.

Best,
-Greg

I should have said specifically that the source calculation doesn't work if the light bends and stays bent.  In a more typical situation where the dielectric is in two parallel planar surfaces, the ray straightens out again and everything works just fine.  Radiance started out only having the dielectric material -- glass and trans types were added much later.

Cheers,
-Greg

Hi Wendelin, Greg,

thank you both for the helpful replies. It is understandable that the direct calculation was optimized by assuming the direction of the ray before and after transmission to be equal. Especially as thin dielectric volumes were the standard application before the glass modifier came into play. In our days, as we use the dielectric practically only for such exotic cases, one might have decided for a more flexible tracing rather than optimizing, as we have glass. In my current case, I can easily workaround the problem.

Still I am having difficulties now to understand how Wendelin's correction can work if the direct ray would entirely miss the source. Applying a factor to a value of zero should not improve the result. Did you use an extended source of type glow? Or was it rather large, so that (most) rays were hitting it even though the direct calculation sent them towards the  wrong direction? It is hard to imagine how this would be possible e.g. with the sun as the only source.

Cheers, Lars.

However, if you substitute the angles in the integral by the old ones before the material, rtrace -I works. The substitution theta_m=arcsin(n1/n2*theta), including cos(theta_m)=sqrt[1-sin^2(theta_m)], leads to a complicated integral that finally can be simplified to

That would lead to an underestimate of about 4% at normal incidence. What I did is to model S1 as a dielectric, S2 as plastic, and ran the rtrace command with the -i switch, location as marked by the o-letter in the sketch and the view vector towards S2.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Gendaylit- bad sky description
Message-ID: <84EF51F9-3973-47EC-9703-F567BAB0D720@relume.com.au>

Hi,

I've run gen_yearvec.bash on an epw file which is throwing up over 500 errors, most of which seem to relate to high direct normal values. I'm getting low overall illuminance values out of dctimestep so I'm not convinced the results are truly representative of the combination of model and weather data. 

Here's an example of data I've pulled out from the err file generated by gen_yearvec.bash, tested in gendaylit.

gendaylit 2 1 8.5 -a -20.27 -o -148.73 -m -150 -W 1031 44 | genskyvec -c 1 1 1 -m 1 |cut -f1 |tr '\n' ' ' >> testAirlie.vec
sky clearness or sky brightness out of range 13.563423	 0.052832
Bad sky description!

Can anyone explain how these values are out of range? I know it seems like a very high direct normal and very low diffuse horizontal, but we're in tropical north Queensland, Australia, here, under sunny skies in December. (Well, I'm not, but the project in question is). 

Thanks, 

John.

Subject: [Radiance-general] how to install
Message-ID: <1359204393.88568.YahooMailNeo@web190203.mail.sg3.yahoo.com>

Hello,
I have to install radiance, I installed radiance by downloading from http://www.radiance-online.org/download-install/installation-information/windows-installation. But it lacks a lot of things. Does anyone know how to install from source code? or is there any other proper windows install available?
Regards
Imran

Hi Everyone,

For those who don't know me, my name is Kera Lagios, and I am one of the
developers of the DIVA-for-Rhino plug-in. Last October,  we held the first
DIVA Day on the campus of MIT in Cambridge, MA. We gathered together DIVA
users to learn advanced simulation methods and exchange work, ideas and
feedback. We have posted the slides and many videos of the day's
presentations on our website www.diva4rhino.com. We encourage you to visit
the site and check out the interesting work.
