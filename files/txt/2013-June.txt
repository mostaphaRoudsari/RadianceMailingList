Dear all,

I am sorry to spam here, but I am not sure of a better place to find people
for this.


The Chilean Center for Sustainable Urban Development (CEDEUS) calls for
Postdoctoral positions starting in 2013 and for a maximum period of three
years. CEDEUS is a center funded by the National Commission for Scientific
and Techological Research (CONICYT).

Postdoctoral researchers will join different ongoing projects inly related
to environmental performance of buildings, with emphasis on thermal and
daylighting, according to architectural design strategies, climate, user's
behavior, complex external shading devices, among others. Researchers of
the group belong to Architectural School and Engineering School of
Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile (PUC).

Please see HERE
<https://www.dropbox.com/s/bj7yxxmg5alrrmr/POSTDOC_FCYT.pdf>for more
information.

THANKS VERY MUCH

Dear all,

I have made a version of the gendaymtx program that uses an EnergyPlus file
(called epw2daymtx). It has all the other options available in gendaymtx,
but I added some new:

- It allows interpolation for subhourly analysis.
- Allows overwriting the latitude-longitude-timezone from the weather file.

In case someone wants to try it and check for bugs and that kind of stuff,
let me know! I compared a few cases, and it worked well.

THANKS

Hi Germ?n,

This is a nice idea, and certainly convenient if you're starting from an EPW file (which I understand is common).  There are translators from EPW to WEA, and it's our intention to release one of these as part of the standard package this summer.

We do have this issue of multiple versions of the Perez sky simulation running around, and keeping those consistent and bug-free.  Jan Wienold's group refit Jean-Jacques Delaunay's original gendaylit code with Wendelin Sprenger, updating it and fixing numerous bugs in a major code cleanup.  In ignorance of these developments, I took Ian Ashdown's implementation of the Perez sky model and created gendaymtx.  Ideally, these two programs would be based on a common library that implements the Perez sky.  Now, we have two different implementations we've had to compare to make sure the results are the same.  I expect there are some corner cases where limits are tested a little differently, producing different outputs.

I don't think either LBNL or ISE have time to unify these two programs at the moment.

Cheers,
-Greg

Hi folks, 

I'm using evalglare on  a 180 degree fisheye image generated by Radiance. It seems that the program is identifying a glare source of unknown location and luminance in the image, and as a result gives no value for DGP or the other glare metrics. Here's the output when using -d:

Greg,

Actually what I did was to combine gendaymtx and Daysim's epw2wea. This was
an intermediate step for another program I am working in. Also, another
intermediate step was the compilation the Daysim's wpe2wea on Mac (in case
you want it)... although I am not quite sure if there are isues considering
the source of the data (Solar or Local time, energy savings, and that kind
of things).

It is good to know in advance that this might change, let me know which one
you choose... I am going to keep working on what I am doing, since I need
to proove some stuff for my MSc, haha.

Regards,

German

PS: My code also has a ot of repeated functions that exist on other files
(gendaymtx, in this case)... I would like to learn how to clean it soon.

Hi Mike,

this looks strange - indeed! The first glare source has an error in the 
x-y location (nan). There was on older version of evalglare (1.00-1.02), 
which had some problems when one pixel of a glare source was located 
directly at the border. but this is fixed for the current version.
What version of evalglare (type evalglare -v) are you using and what 
fish-eye type is used for the image?
Can you send me such an hdr (not to the group, directly to my email 
adress jan.wienold at ise.fraunhofer.de).

Jan

Hi Greg and All,

In brief follow-up to this, I want to sanity check myself. For the 3 
phase method:

  * vmx - for rcontrib klems_int.cal needs the normal from the glazing
    surface pointing to the interior, eg <0,1,0> for a south facing window
  * dmx - for genklemsamp the view direction is the normal direction
    pointing outside, the opposite of what is used for vmx, eg <0,-1,0>
    for a south facing window

Lastly, as long as a glazing surface is not facing straight up, that is 
a skylight parallel to the ground plane, then then an up direction of 
<0,0,1> can be used.

Thanks,

-Jack

Jack,

What you say about the VMX and DMX are correct.

For the up direction, if the window is not a skylight, the 0 0 1 can be
used; but it has to be noted that that direction will be projected over the
plane of the window, so, in reality, it will not be 0 0 1 anymore.

Ah! I was using an older version from last April (1.04). 

After updating to the most recent (1.11), everything is working fine. 

Thanks Jan,
Mike

Subject: [Radiance-general] gendyamtx - cumulative results
Message-ID: <51B21727.60200@visarc.com>

Hello All,

If I want to show cumulative results (images), eg lux hrs per year or 
lux hrs per month, what is the right way to do this for the 3 phase with 
dctimestep. So for example with an annual sky matrix generated with 
gendaymtx, do I sum this up somehow and then apply?

Thanks,

-Jack

I think the simple answer is that gendaymtx currently doesn't support 3 phase. Weah.

Guess I'd better read that thing. Initially, it did not support 3 phase. Hopefully Andy or Greg or someone else who actually knows what the hell's going on can answer your question. =8-)

Hi Jack,

I think the easiest method would be to extract the hours you want to accumulate from your WEA file, send them through gendaymtx and dctimestep like so:

	gendaymtx -of subyear.wea > subyear1.smx
	dctimestep -if -n 720 -o win1w_%03d.hdr winterior1w.vmx blinds30.xml westelev.dmx subyear1.smx
	pcomb win1w_*.hdr > win1w_sum.hdr
	rm win1w_*.hdr

This will generate 720 images corresponding to a month's worth of hourly inputs from window #1 on the west elevation.  The above steps (except the first) will have to be repeated for your different windows.  If you do a year at a time, you'll have to sum all these images together in batches, since pcomb only handles up to 1024 images at a time (so long as you don't run into system limits first).

I hope this addresses your question.  To be honest, I've never done anything like this and I'm not entirely sure I got it right.

Cheers,
-Greg

Actually, I just realized that you could shortcut this quite a bit by summing together your time steps out of gendaymtx.  You should be able to run:

gendaymtx -od jan.wea | total -id3 -720 > jan.sky
dctimestep  winterior1w.vmx blinds30.xml westelev.dmx jan.sky > win1w_jan.hdr

Again, you'll need to run dctimestep for each of your windows and sum the results, but it should be a whole lot quicker this way.  If you want to sum up a whole year, just change the -720 option on total to -8160 (or whatever).

Cheers,
-Greg

Hi Greg,

Excellent! This is what I was wondering about as a solution.

I will give this a try.

Thanks,

Oh, yeah, and the number used in total needs to match the number of days in the month, so I kind of blew it assuming January has 30 days in my example!  (Should have been "total -id3 -744".)  This works because gendaymtx outputs time steps as columns in the matrix (inside sort). The final output will contain 3 ASCII triplets for each patch, so you don't need to change anything for different -m options to gendaymtx.  You just need to make sure your matrix dimensions are expecting the right number of patches.

Best,
-Greg

The above steps (except the first) will have to be repeated for your different windows.  If you do a year at a time, you'll have to sum all these images together in batches, since pcomb only handles up to 1024 images at a time (so long as you don't run into system limits first).

Subject: [Radiance-general] Luminance contrast calculation
Message-ID: <CAAZQWqjGFjDxnUEGA0itjt-f78E_cPBSKfVPobdsjSutX4=pSg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to calculate luminance contrast between various surfaces or
Radiance image, and compare it to recommended values.
Idea is to calculate for each suface (eg. paper, desk, walls, floor etc)
average luminance, and obtain contrast as ratio between these luminances


Question: How to calculate average luminance for a surface on Radiance
image?
My first idea was to identify pixels for each surface, and calculate their
average luminance as simple average value:
*Average_lum = sum(pixel_luminance)/num_of_surface_pixels,*
where only pixels for specific surface are taken into account.

But after some thinking, maybe that wouldn't be correct approach.
Maybe solid angle of each pixel should be taken into account to have
physically correct value
*Average_lum =
sum(pixel_luminance*pixel_solid_angle)/sum(pixel_solid_angle), *
where only pixels for specific surface are taken into account.

So my real question would be: if we calculate average luminance for some
part of radiance image, should we take into account size of each pixel
(solid angle) or not?

###
Related to contrast calculation I'm still thinking if images I'm rendering
and analysing should be hemispherical (like for evalglare) or have some
human-like field of vision (-vtv -vh 110 -vv 70 for example)
Suggestions?

###
Another question is more theoretical - when we are talking about contrasts,
should we take into account average values (for work task, environment
surfaces etc), or extreme values like maximal luminance.

I know this question is somewhat close to glare calculation, so maybe Jan
has some experience with luminance calculation for various surfaces on the
scene.

Thanks in advance,
Marija

Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiosity method implementation on Radiance
Message-ID: <CAF-iH4+CAZ1CanJvKdq0vM0_Xmw0uCh-a5y3tp3ODbQX90J9Uw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear everyone,

I am thinking on implementing a hybrid methodology between Radiosity method
and Ray-tracing, for accelerating some calculations (by giving up accuracy,
maybe)

As everyone here knows, Radiance ray-tracing works awesome; however, I
could not find anything related to any Radiosity implementation.

I think I can make algorythms to subdivide polygons into meshes, however,
what I do not know how to do is:

*1.- Calculation of View (Form) Factors:* I guess a straitforward way is to
calculate them by randomly sending rays from one surface to the rest of
them, but I do not know how to do that (or use octrees). (k/N would be the
view factor Fij... where k is the number of rays that falled into j from i,
and N the total number of rays sent)

*2.- Render:* After I have the Radiosities of every polygon. How can I make
a render? I guess I can use *vwrays *somehow, but I am not sure how to
check which polygon am I "seeing", in order to use the calculated values.

Any information is useful,

THANKS

German

PS: I know people here might like Ray-tracing more than anything else, but
still... This implementation might help

Message-ID: <CAOQvQdmx2cvqJ9NSJ11YYFFbeptTifXgmRdb4EGqKnBHMrJMhA@mail.gmail.com>

hallo,

I have a question before i go through my search:

I made HDR pictures with photosphere, then i tried to use evalglare ( in
windows) but it gave me the
following message " error: no valid view specified"

- Does anyone knows how to fix the problem with clear steps? (i guess i
have to include header file
and so on, but i am not sure how ! ?

another question :) :

- I have mac version 10.6.8 and radiance 4.2a, but evalglare is not working
anymore, should i
upgrade my mac to 10.8?


p.s: I worked with evalglare before but only through radiance hdr pictures.

thx in advance

nassif

Greg,

Inspired by Mark Stock's semi-recent post, i am curious if HDRgen could be
compiled to work on the Beagle Bone?

#####
http://beagleboard.org/Products/BeagleBone
BeagleBone is an $89 MSRP, credit-card-sized Linux computer that connects
to the Internet and runs software such as Android 4.0 and Ubuntu. With
plenty of I/O and processing power for real-time analysis provided by an
AM335x 720MHz ARM? processor, BeagleBone can be complemented with cape
plug-in boards to augment functionality.
#####


>From a search on the HDRI list archive, i found that:

##################

I managed to compile hdrgen under Lubuntu using VMWare, so if anyone else
wants a copy, let me know.  I'll send one to Axel since it's a little more
recent version of the code (I think).

-Greg

##################

In summary, i plan to procure a Beagle Bone, install Ubuntu and Radiance,
and include hdrgen to complete the setup if you can supply me with a copy.


My interest here is in using a CCD camera to capture bracketed sets of
images, composite and analyze them on the Beagle Bone (via Radiance and
HDRgen),  then use the information to thoughtfully control lighting and
shading systems in a physical space.

This plea may have more appropriately been made on the HDRI list, but i
wanted to add it to the current topic of Radiance paired with tiny low-cost
computers.

If others have comments or suggestions on the viability of this effort i
would be grateful to hear them!

-Kyle

Well, if it's really important to you guys, you or Kyle could "borrow" my code to compile on your little credit-card computers.  I don't have much time right now to mess around with it.

Hi Nassif,

Radiance includes a script called "vinfo" that allows you to edit the information header of an image.  I'm not sure what view parameters evalglare needs from the header, but at minimum, you should include the -vh and -vv parameters in a "VIEW= -vtv -vh [deg] -vh [deg]" specification.  Photosphere sometimes adds such a line if it can figure out the camera lens settings from the Exif header.

No need to upgrade your Mac OS version if you're having issues with evalglare.  I don't think that has anything to do with it.  More likely, you don't have the latest version of it.  Maybe Jan can chime in with some advice.

Best,
-Greg

to check which version of evalglare you have, type evalglare -v in the terminal. 

I upgraded a few weeks ago to version 1.11 release 17.01.2013, which I believe is the most current.

Hi Nassif,

the most important thing is, that you KNOW what is your type of lens you 
are using. Then you have to "transfer" its specification into correct 
radiance view parameters.
what you need is view type, horizontal and vertical size of the image.

If you look at the documentation of evalglare you can see, that you can 
specify the view type when calling evalglare (you don't have to add the 
view spec to the HDR file):

/In case, the view settings within the image are missing or are not 
valid (e.g. after the use of pcompos or pcomb), the view options can be 
set by command line options. As soon as view options are set within the 
command line, view options within the image are ignored. The view 
options are implemented according to the RADIANCE definition (please 
read man page of rpict for details)://
//-vtt Set view type to t. (for fish-eye views, please use --vta or 
--vth preferably)//
//-vf viewfile Get view parameters from file.//
//-vv val Set the view vertical size to val.//
//-vh val Set the view horizontal size to val.//
/
And be sure using the latest version of evalglare (1.11).

Good luck!

Jan

Did you think about in what use cases radiosity may be faster, and in
which it wouldn't? And are you aware of the "hybrid" rendering approach
used by Radiance? Especially the way that the ambient cache is working
as a means to accelerate the stochastic diffuse-indirect calculation
that a radiosity renderer aims at?

If you want to do this using scripts and the available tools, you could
step through all surfaces in a scene file. There are tools to do the
sampling available.

You can tell rtrace to output object names instead of radiance or
irradiance values. You can also get both the name of the object and its
radiance. This would even allow to add the radiance value of a scene
with -ab 0 and the precalculated "radiosity" value. Somehow what most
radiosity renderers do to achieve sharp shadows (they add a
raytracing-step for direct calculation).

Still I have doubts that this can be faster than the current
implementation.... :)

Cheers, Lars.

Thanks for the answers Lars!

I am thinking on "one-zone" simple scenes, without furniture. I was
checking out Lightsolve
<http://www.phil-seaton.com/#/lightsolve>algorithms, and for them,
this approach seem to be working well. I am
thinking on something similar, but not the same.

Also, a friend of mine did some work on lighting simulations, and claimed
that Radiosity was actually much faster than Radiance for those
calculations.

Anyway, lets see what others can say about this... I was aware of the
hybrid-stochastic-deterministic capabilities of Radiance, but I am not sure
what that exactly means, so I cannot say if this would be faster or not.

THANKS!

German

As I've noted when asked this question in the past, radiosity is faster for simple spaces with many interior reflections.  Complex spaces quickly become expensive to compute, and the meshing of them can be a nightmare.

If you need to compute the illumination of an empty box, then anything is going to be fast.  If it's really, really important for you to compute empty boxes in a second or two, then radiosity is the way to go.  If you can wait 30 seconds, Radiance works, too.

If you have a complex building to render with trees and sky, have fun doing it with radiosity!

Cheers,
-Greg

Germ?n, are you looking for a way to quickly estimate light levels for 
luminaire layout?

Ok, I will have all that in mind!

I cannot give so many details now, but our idea is to get fast solutions
(trying to achieve interactivity) for design of interior spaces.

THANKS EVERYONE

Is the intention to check if speed improvements are possible? It could be a lot of work for potentially little gain. Maybe there are already validation/benchmark studies that could show it takes X minutes to get within 10% of a known solution with radiosity and Y minutes to get within 10% of the same solution with Radiance.

Or maybe radiosity is perceived to be faster, but you have a scenario that your favorite radiosity software doesn't handle well? Maybe Radiance only handles the scenario of interest well because it doesn't use radiosity.

I suppose since Radiance is open source, there is a potential path toward implementing radiosity into Radiance - whereas most radiosity software (AGI, Dialux, etc.) would not accommodate a homespun version implementing a Perez sky for example or outputting an HDR image for use in evalglare.

Keep in mind that adapting Radiance to a radiosity method probably requires to ignore (or otherwise account for) the specular reflection component defined as part of any material type. In many scenes this may be unimportant.

Hi Germ?n,

aeons ago I hacked up a primitive radiosity thingy for RADIANCE in an afternoon to compare with our measurements for validation of diffuse interreflection. It's actually embedded in the rendering engine and may not compile with the current release anymore, but it might be worth looking at to give you some ideas on how (not?) to do it. As I recall, it used a standard relaxation method and a fixed quadrilateral mesh, so nothing fancy.

Let me know if you're interested and I'll excavate that ancient artifact.

Regards,

--Roland

Randolph,

No, that is not my plan... I actually do not know much about artificial
lighting, hahaha.

Christopher,

I have some ideas that I would like to evaluate both in accuracy and speed.
Is not that any other software does not handle well what I am trying to do,
but as you said, I need some procedures and programs that exist in
Radiance, such as evalglare and the Perez model... sacrificing the
specularity is what I meant by "giving up some accuracy".


The advantage that I see on Radiosity+ray-tracing is that the ambient
calculations can be done with radiosity, and the direct calculations can be
done with ray-tracing. By doing that, the ray-tracing parameters are
relaxed, and fast to compute.

When everything is done, it is possible to move and render images fast,
using the precalculated values. This might be important to choose where to
locate furniture, for example.

I am going to stick to what Greg said for now:

*"If you need to compute the illumination of an empty box, then anything is
going to be fast.  If it's really, really important for you to compute
empty boxes in a second or two, then radiosity is the way to go.  If you
can wait 30 seconds, Radiance works, too."*
*
*
If I have time in the future, I will try to test my ideas... whether they
do their job well or not, would you, guys, be interested on having some
radiosity modules here for research purposes?

THANKS FOR COMMENTING ALL OF YOU!

German

Did no one respond to this?

There isn't really such a thing as "average luminance" for a surface.  It has to be "average luminance for a surface from a specific view," which sounds like what you are discussing.  In this context, I don't think it makes much difference whether you average by pixel solid angle or not, as it tends to change slowly over an image.  Similarly, the view type does not matter very much to the result.

If you actually want to know the significance of an object's luminance to glare or the like, then you don't want to average luminance at all -- you want the contribution to vertical illuminance as a sum of pixels times projected solid angle.  For this, simply adding up pixels from a hemispherical fisheye is the easiest method.

The whole notion of luminance contrasts in a viewing environment is ill-conceived in my opinion.  Originally, the rule of thumb was a maximum contrast ratio of 3:1, which no reasonable space actually achieves.  One specular highlight will ruin your whole metric!

Cheers,
-Greg

Hi Roland,

Thanks for the offering! Maybe in the (near, I hope) future I will ask you
for that! for now, I am working in some other stuff.

THANKS!

Hi Marija,

there are two issues:
1. metric
2. how to calculate technically

regarding metrics, the whole thing is not as easy. Definitely the DGP 
doesn't catch contrast related glare, when the "contrast" is located 
directly besides the task. For example, if you are investigating a 
computer workplace in an open plan office and just above your computer 
screen is located in the far a window. In this case users might 
experience glare, even for very low luminances, which are also no 
problem regarding reflectances on the computer screen. In that case, a 
ratio 1:3 seems reasonable, but is also not proven by any user 
assessments so far (at least to my knowledge). But what happens, when 
this contrast is more displaced from viewing position? This is  not 
clear to me how to handle. Of course you could evaluate on the "safe 
side", saying in a 30? cone you allow only 1:3, outside that cone 1:10.
Regarding using max or mean of a surface, I would say it depends. If you 
have really a peak (lets say a specular reflection of the sun), then you 
should take it into account as glare source (and weight it with its 
solid angle). This glare is captured pretty good by the DGP, but I 
wouldn't use the luminance of it for a contrast evaluation. For the 
contrast I would use the average luminance of the surface of your interest.

how to calculate contrast for your surfaces: technically you can use 
evalglare for this. I'm currently on a plane and can't check the 
web-site, but as far as I can remember I had a tutorial for that in my 
presentation at the radiance workshop in 2009 in Boston (seminar in 
advance to the workshop). The trick is using masks. basically you have 
to generate a image only containing your surfaces of interest, having 
the correct luminances. then run evalglare in a way, that each surface 
will be one glare source and evaluate them with the -d option. You may 
reduce the search radius (-r option).
Your mask should contain only the surfaces, which you want to 
investigate (=calculate the average luminance of this surface). In the 
case of HDR images, I used simple photoshop to mark the area of interest 
(-> make them black). In case of simulations, it is easier, since you 
can just change the reflectance of your surfaces of interest to zero and 
generate an masking image. If the surfaces are not touching each other, 
you can evaluate all the surfaces also at once. The masking command I 
used was pcomb /input.pic/--s -1000 /mask.pic/> /eval.pic./ Using the -d 
option of evalglare (and switching off the peak extraction by -x) you 
get provided all found glare sources, including position in x-y 
coordinates, solid angle and average luminance. You should check by the 
-c option, if evalglare detects the surfaces properly. Each found glare 
source should correspond then your surfaces of interest. Don't use any 
of the glare metrics then, just the information of the glare sources.

Good luck!Best,

Jan

Hi Greg and Jan,

Thanks for input. Although contrast requirements, like 3:1, are often
mentioned, I haven't found some nice discussion on practical issues and
calculation, so it is very useful to hear and learn something useful on
this topic.

###
Related to Gregs' answer, I agree with you that calculation of surfaces
contrast is rather not well defined. I have a request for a project to
calculate contrast values, while definition of contrast itself is not very
precise.

As you said we can calculate either average or maximum - but values can
vary extremely. This is especially visible in daylight offices, with clear
skiy and sun light coming directly into the space. As Jan said, if sun
reflection is visible, it will give extremely high light peak - and extreme
contrast.
(Generally I don't think these contrast related things are defined well
enough)

Related to Jans' answer about surfaces luminance, I haven't tried the
method you suggest (I'll read your presentation), with evalglare and masked
images.

Instead, I use method like this:

   - I use rtrace with -ovs or -ovm option turned on (so I detect materials
   or surface for each pixel).
   - Calculate image with rtrace and same parameters and ambient file -to
   have it faster,
   - From image extract with pcomb/pvalue solid angles for each pixel.
   - After these steps I have for each pixel info about its solid angle,
   radiance and material.
   - I analyse these data with Python numpy library to extract average
   values for all surfaces/materials in the scene.

Maybe there is some more automatic way to do this with Radiance commands
only (without numpy), but I couldn't find it, and since I'm writing program
in Python it was not a problem to use numpy library.

Thanks again,
Marija

Dear All,

I am aware that this is not directly related to the discussion group but I
am sure the experts here most likely have the know-how or connections
related to this.

A colleague of mine would like to construct a heliodon for academic and
experimental purposes at a university. Could someone please point to any
resources/people with the construction drawings that can be used to
construct this? (most likely this will be built by the students themselves
or semi-skilled workers).

Thanks in advance,

Dear Shri,

I believe that Norbert Lechner has some construction drawings on his web site. I am usually borrowing a very simple heliodon from Lam Partners for the MIT daylighting class. The best forum to post this question on is the Society of Building Science Educators. A key discussion to have is of course what one can actually do with heliodon measurements.

Best,

Good morning.

some years ago I built a very practical helidon where the lamps supporting
arch is vertical and translates along the ceiling,
but the table can be shifted.

The arch is 3.0 m diameter, made of aluminum profiles, mounted within a
rigid U upside down. The translation happens by cables and fixed and
movable wheels (I used thin plastic pulleys and clothe lines). It moves
such that when the table is on the horizontal, the line connectiong the 6AM
position (as high as the table) to the center of the table is in an angle
of 23?25' to the rotation axis.

A special switch with 13 positions and off was installed.
I made several drawings and concluded that such a geometry may reproduce
solar angles with enough precision, even at high latitudes.

I built it inside a dark room because that time (12 years ago) we needed
contrast for our film cameras.

Everything costed me less than US$ 500.

A picture is attached. I cannot find plans any more.

Hi Shrikar! Remember me?

I would also check with Kevin Van Den Wymelenberg at the University of 
Idaho. He did his masters thesis on creating a regional lighting lab.

Dear Shri,

You can find information on the PEC heliodon here:
http://www.pge.com/myhome/edusafety/workshopstraining/pec/toolbox/arch/heliodon/index.shtml
If you want to contact the machinist who built this one, please contact me directly.

A heliodon can provide useful solar geometry. 
For solar lighting, stick with Radiance.

Subject: [Radiance-general] pcond stdin
Message-ID: <28285BAEA8C0814DBF1B199C876EC5B0599D7698F3@AMXEXC01.global.arup.com>

I often use temporary files for the following sequence, since pcond doesn't play well with piped input from pfilt. I don't have a detailed understanding of stdin, but is there anything I'm missing? It seems counterintuitive, but maybe it would be faster to run pcond on the full size image (unless it was oversampled by more than double).

rpict scene.oct > highres.hdr
pfilt -x /2 -y /2 highres.hdr > temp.hdr
pcond -s temp.hdr | ra_ppm | convert ...


-----Original Message-----

Even if you are going to a program that expects input on stdin, you can redirect it instead:

!fussy_program < input | second_program etc...

Subject: [Radiance-general] pcond stdin

References: <28285BAEA8C0814DBF1B199C876EC5B0599D7698F3@AMXEXC01.global.arup.com>

I thought this discussion was on radiance-dev.  How did it migrate here?

In any case, we were talking about inline commands in Radiance scene descriptions, not regular Radiance commands.

It is true that pcond likes to be given its file argument.  That's because it reads the file twice.  Your set of commands could be simplified by:

rpict scene.oct | pfilt -1 -x /2 -y /2 > temp.hdr
pcond -s temp.hdr | ra_ppm | convert ...

The "-1" option of pfilt avoids making two passes on the input to determine exposure, which pcond overrides, anyway.

Cheers,
-Greg

All,

Just a quick note, there are updated installers for DOE/LBNL's Radiance available for all major platforms available on NREL's website, here:

https://openstudio.nrel.gov/getting-started-developer/getting-started-radiance

These are based on the latest (HEAD) state of the Radiance source tree, as of June, uh, I dunno, sometime last week. =)
