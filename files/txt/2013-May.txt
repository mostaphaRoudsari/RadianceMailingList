My friend and fellow lighting software author, Ian Ashdown, gave me the following message for the Radiance community.  

Ian is responsible for the creation and development of the AGi32 simulation engine, which is widely regarded in the lighting design community (for good reason).  He has suggested that it would be a good idea for one or more persons to undertake a validation of Radiance based on CIE 171:2006, a suite of sample lighting scenes with known numerical solutions.  I believe Radiance has been partially validated against this dataset.  In particular, Mike Donn posted a request for more information with a couple of references to others' work along these lines in 2011:

(Corrected links from post: <http://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2008-fribourg/Content/Geisler-Moroder/RW2008_DGM_AD.pdf> and <http://www.ibpsa.org/proceedings/BS2011/P_1146.pdf>)

I don't know of anyone who has gone through the entire CIE 171 test set, but this is what Ian proposes.  Note that there are some tests to watch out for, and whoever works on this will probably be talking to me at multiple points.  I look forward to learning something new in the conversation.

One way to approach this would be to set up a wiki or plone site where individuals could upload their validation tests and open them up for comments.  This would require some public documentation of the CIE 171 tests, and this is where it all gets a bit fuzzy.  I don't have this document and if we were to purchase it, I am uncertain as to the legality of sharing (portions of) it.

Ideas and further suggestions are welcome.

Cheers,

This is an academic  challenge for the Radiance community.

Validation of lighting design and analysis software has been an issue within
the architectural lighting design community since the first commercial
programs were released in the 1980s. Several studies were performed for
physical spaces, the most notable being:

   DiLaura, D. L., D. P. Igoe, P. G. Samara, and A. M. Smith. 1988.
?Verifying the Applicability of Computer Generated Pictures to Lighting
Design,? Journal of the Illuminating Engineering Society 17(1):36?61.

where the authors constructed and measured the proverbial empty rectangular
room while carefully monitoring and controlling photometer calibration,
ambient temperature, luminaire voltage, ballast-lamp photometric factors,
lamp burn-in and other light loss factors, surface reflectances, accurate
photometric data reports, and other issues.

Such studies are useful for interior lighting designs, but considerably less
so for daylight studies where it is nearly impossible to measure, let alone
control, the sky conditions.

They are also mostly pointless for complex spaces with occlusions and
non-diffuse reflective surfaces. Regardless of how carefully the room
parameters might be modeled and controlled, the results only apply to that
particular space.

The alternative is to develop a series of test cases with known analytic
solutions based on radiative flux transfer theory. This became the premise
for:

   Maamari, F., M. Fontoynont, and N. Adra. 2006. ?Application of the CIE
Test Cases to Assess the Accuracy of Lighting Computer Programs,? Energy and
Buildings 38:869-877.

and:

   CIE 171:2006, ?Test Cases to Assess the Accuracy of Lighting Computer
Programs.? Wein, Austria: Commission International de l?Eclairage.

At least lighting software companies,  DIAL (www.dial.de) and Lighting
Analysts (www.agi32.com), validated their software products with respect to
CIE 171:2006. It does not appear however that anyone has done this for
Radiance.

As a Radiance community member, you may rightly ask, "Is this even
necessary?" Numerous studies have demonstrated the accuracy and reliability
of Radiance, which may rightly claim the title of being the gold standard
for lighting simulation software. (I am saying this as the Senior Research
Scientist for Lighting Analysts, by the way.)

My answer is yes, but not for the reasons you might think.

Lighting Analysts engaged an independent third party called Dau Design &
Consulting (www.dau.ca/ddci ) to perform the CIE 171 validation tests using
AGi32 in 2007. The full report is available here:

www.agi32.com/Downloads/TechnicalDocs/Report%20on%20AGI%2032%20validation%20of%20CIE%20171_Compiled_070620.pdf.

What was interesting about the tests was that AGi32 failed a number of them
on the first pass. As simple as they are, the results were dependent on such
things as the surface meshing parameters and convergence limits (for
radiosity calculations). Roughly equivalent parameters for ray tracing would
be the number of rays and the number of reflections.

It was easy enough to optimize the parameters obtain the best results, which
is what an experienced user would likely do anyhow for complex environments.

Note that I said "experienced user"; that is, someone who has learned by
trial and error what works best for a given software product. CIE 171:2006
has the potential (so far unrealized) of providing beginning users with a
cookbook of sorts to document and choose the best rendering parameters for
various situations. This alone would be valuable, but it becomes even more
useful when the user needs to work with two or more lighting simulation
programs and hopefully obtain similar results.

Validating AGi32 against CIE 171:2006 also led to a few puzzles where no
amount of parameter tweaking produced acceptable results. Further in-depth
analysis proved that the tests themselves were incorrect, being based in
invalid assumptions. These are documented in the report, but sadly CIE
Division 3 has not seen the need to issue an amendment to CIE 171. There are
at least also two other tests (5.13 and 5.14) that have been called into
question.

These issues notwithstanding, CIE 171:2006 is a useful document, which leads
to the academic challenge ...

Validation of Radiance against CIE 171:2006 involves more than just setting
up a few simple models and running the tests. There will undoubtedly be test
cases where the calculated results do not even begin to agree with the
published results. Optimizing the program parameters will demand an in-depth
understanding of what they actually mean and do, and so offer a valuable
learning experience for students doing for example a class project.

Digging deeper, there will likely be other issues with the test cases where
invalid assumptions lead to incorrect published results, subtle or
otherwise. Just because CIE 171:2006 was derived from a PhD thesis does not
mean that it is entirely correct. This, combined with proposals for more
rigorous and comprehensive tests, could form the basis for an interesting
MSc thesis. (The tests are mostly derived from radiative flux transfer
theory and as such are aimed at radiosity-based methods. If these are not
suitable for ray tracing methods, what would be reasonable equivalent
tests?)

Finally, it would alleviate a lot of angst regarding lighting software
validation in the architectural lighting design community if the major
commercial and open source products were validated against CIE 171:2006
(with acknowledgement that there are no overall pass/fail results). Ideally,
each company or software developer would conduct the tests in-house because
they know their products best. The catch here is that they would then be
expected to publicly post both the results and their test models so that
anyone could use their products to confirm the test results. This would
ensure that the test results remain valid as the products undergo continual
improvement.

In terms of Radiance, it could be a community effort, with various people
contributing test models and proposing best parameter settings. In addition
to providing a useful "best practices" guide for Radiance, this would likely
result in Radiance validating CIE 171:2006. It would also be welcomed as a
valuable contribution by the architectural lighting design community.

Great idea. We had planned to use the test cases in CIE 171:2006 for validating the Radiance implementation in OpenStudio, but this effort had to get scaled down in the interest of time. I like the idea of hosting a site (similar to Mark Stock's benchmark site (http://markjstock.org/pages/rad_bench.html)) where individuals could report their own results. I would like to throw NREL's hat into the ring for hosting such a thing, with the caveat that Greg brings up about copyright issues over CIE 171. Maybe some folks closer to CIE (John M?) could weigh in on this. We could of course just post the results, and anyone wishing to either perform the validations or to understand the meaning behind the results would have to get their hands on the document. That doesn't seem like too much of a burden to software developers or to scholars of lighting simulation, after all.

I'm working through the tutorials in Rendering with Radiance & have 2 commands that I'm having trouble with so far.


1.       !cat (concatenate)  - from page 80 in book - Scene 1 Tutorial, section 2.5 - is this still a valid command?  I couldn't find an executable file for it in my  Radiance directory & a search online didn't bring up reference to it either.    The error I get when I try to run oconv is "Can't find executable for "cat" .system - cannot execute "!cat ./lib/table_1.rad"



2.       Genprism - from page 53 in book - I can run genprism if I don't put in the final 4 extrusion factors.   What am I doing wrong?
If I run the command as written in the book:  genprism brown_satin_paint stool_leg_sw 4 -0.7 -0.7 -0.6 -0.7 -0.6 -0.6 -0.7 -0.6 -1 0 0 2.5 > look.txt
I get the following error:               Usage:  genprism material name { - | vfile | N v1 v2 .. vN} [-1 1vect] [-r radius] [-c][-e]

If I run the command without the extrusion vector (final 4 #'s) it creates the prism with the 'z' values at 1 which I'm guessing is the default.

Thank you for help!!

Hi,

cat is a Unix program, so it should be available under OSX and Linux, but not under Windows. Wikipedia says the command ??type?? is an equivalent, but I haven??t tried it.

About genprism, I think the argument before the vector should be -l (lower case ??L??) not -1 (the number one), I??m not sure which one you??ve used, but may be worth checking.

Hope this helps.
Santiago

I did a test a while ago according to one of the cases described in
CIE171:2006 (case 5.9 Sky component for a roof unglazed opening and the CIE
general sky types):

image 1: modeled in Houdini. Radiance settings are shown in the parameter
panel for the tool customized in Houdini
http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1EN8M6iBQaw/UYsi0umzZeI/AAAAAAAAEv8/QFmcf0zXiVE/s1600/3.PNG

image 2: simulation results (daylight factor value using CIE standard
overcast sky)
http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-R9Vii2wAW5c/UYsi37tQYrI/AAAAAAAAEwE/ZNwZuvK7zW4/s640/4.PNG

image 3: difference between the simulation and the number reported in
CIE171:2006
http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bDEPRFnG0aU/UYsi5NNzg7I/AAAAAAAAEwM/ESNHm9J7voU/s1600/2.PNG

It seems that my tool can get most of the results close to CIE's numbers,
but the point over the corner tends to under-estimate the daylight factor
value (e.g point zero).

Not sure if this is done appropriately and if this is relevant to what Greg
is proposing, and advices are appreciated!

Message-ID: <1B23446CBF250648A2FC775DE3FE7E800FEBDCDE@OC11expo28.exchange.mit.edu>

Dear Radiance aficionados:

As in previous years, we will be offering a three day Executive Education program on Daylighting Buildings<http://execed.gsd.harvard.edu/programs/daylighting-buildings-1> at Harvard from July 10-12 2013.

Course participants will acquire a range of daylighting design analysis techniques ranging from rules of thumb to state-of-the-art computer simulations and high dynamic range photography for glare analysis. The main simulation program used will be DIVA<http://diva4rhino.com/>, a Rhino plug-in that supports the calculation of daylight availability (Radiance/DAYSIM), annual daylight glare probability maps (Radiance/Evalglare), thermal load calculations (EnergyPlus) and radiation maps (Radiance/GenCumulativeSky). The assumptions underlying these programs will be discussed in detail.

The first two days will consist of formal instructions, in-class discussions, hands-on software tutorials, and exercises. Participants will also be given the opportunity to calibrate their personal digital cameras to take HDR images and learn several ways to quantitatively evaluate these images. During the last day, participants will be given the opportunity to apply the newly acquired analysis techniques to ongoing projects of their own.

If you want to make this your "daylighting week" you could further join us on the following Monday, July 15, for DIVA DAY in New York. (Details to follow.)

Best,

Christoph

Thank you, Santiago

?type? doesn?t work but now that I know that it is a unix command I will see if I can find a windows command that will.

And you are right I had a ?1? instead of a lower case L.  works now.

Thanks!

Hi,

cat is a Unix program, so it should be available under OSX and Linux, but not under Windows. Wikipedia says the command ?type? is an equivalent, but I haven?t tried it.

About genprism, I think the argument before the vector should be -l (lower case ?L?) not -1 (the number one), I?m not sure which one you?ve used, but may be worth checking.

Hope this helps.
Santiago

I?m working through the tutorials in Rendering with Radiance & have 2 commands that I?m having trouble with so far.


1.       !cat (concatenate)  - from page 80 in book - Scene 1 Tutorial, section 2.5 - is this still a valid command?  I couldn?t find an executable file for it in my  Radiance directory & a search online didn?t bring up reference to it either.    The error I get when I try to run oconv is ?Can?t find executable for ?cat? .system - cannot execute ?!cat ./lib/table_1.rad?



2.       Genprism - from page 53 in book - I can run genprism if I don?t put in the final 4 extrusion factors.   What am I doing wrong?
If I run the command as written in the book:  genprism brown_satin_paint stool_leg_sw 4 -0.7 -0.7 -0.6 -0.7 -0.6 -0.6 -0.7 -0.6 -1 0 0 2.5 > look.txt
I get the following error:               Usage:  genprism material name { - | vfile | N v1 v2 .. vN} [-1 1vect] [-r radius] [-c][-e]

If I run the command without the extrusion vector (final 4 #?s) it creates the prism with the ?z? values at 1 which I?m guessing is the default.

Thank you for help!!

That's odd Sandy, 'type' is the replacement command for 'cat' on Windows systems. When you say it "didn't work", what do you mean? Is the command there but complaining about a syntax error, or does your system complain that 'type' is an unknown command? Because type is standard on Windows, at least XP and 7?

Neither "cat" nor "type" are necessary in any case.  Whenever a command is written:

! cat file | program arg1 arg2 ..

you can replace it with:

!program arg1 arg2 .. < file

This works on Unix and Windows, so no need to specialize.

Hi Rob & Greg,

Actually I can get 'type' to work at the command line - outside the scene txt file - (I had the slashes the wrong way first).  I just can't seem to 'call' it when creating the oct file if it is a line in the scene txt file like the 'cat' program is shown from page 80 of the book "!cat lib/table_1.rad".  

My understanding from the 'cat' command in the tutorial is that it will append those files to the end of the octree - making my scene file less cumbersome.  (Please correct if I am not understanding that correctly!).   

If I replace the cat line above with "type lib/table_1.rad" and do oconv I get the error "can't find executable for type".  However if I go to command line & use "type .\lib\table_1.rad >> scene1.all" it will append the table_1 file to the end of scene1.all.

Which is fine with me since I'm incredibly happy when something works!! But I'm guessing having that simple line in the scene file, which makes the scene file smaller will come in very handy when I'm doing more complex projects.

I wasn't able to get the 'program' command to work at either the command line or from within the txt file.

Thank you all for your help!

Hi all,

I did a validation against the test cases in chapter 5 (test cases with
analytical references) of CIE 171:2006 about 2 years ago for an internal
evaluation. The report that contains the results is all in german, however,
the numbers are "international" :-). So together with the results from
chapter 4 (experimental test cases; I presented parts of them at the
workshop in 2008, the overall chapter 4 results are in my thesis) I should
have results for all test cases in the CIE report.
There should be some more proposals for test cases in chapter 6 of CIE 171,
however, if I remember right they are somewhat unclear and not properly
specified.

Greg, I will send you the report off-list, and if necessary can also take
some time to translate it...

Best,
David

Subject: [Radiance-general] ambient include / exclude options (-ae, -ai, -aE,
	-aI)
Message-ID: <518F8019.9000602@gmx.net>

Hi all,

I had a closer look at the behaviour of the ambient exlude option -ae,
which is one of several tweaks for detail geometry in large scenes.

I set up a very simple test scene. A box 1 x 1 x 1 is indirectly lid by
a surface below the ceiling, pointing up. The walls of the box are
assigned a material "copy", which inherits its properties from a
lambertian plastic material "original". A sensor records illuminance
below that light source, which means that it should receive only light
reflected back from the box surfaces. I run rtrace four times:

a) direct only:

rtrace -ov -I+ -h -ab X -av 0 0 0

This should give a zero reading, as the luminous (upper) surface of the
light source is not directly visible.

b) direct+indirect:

rtrace -ov -I+ -h -ab 3 -av 0 0 0 test.oct

This should give a reading of the light reflected by several bounces
from the ceiling and walls of the box.

c) direct+indirect with -ae original:

rtrace -ov -I+ -h -ab 3 -av 0 0 0 -ae original test.oct

This should give the same result as b), as excluding the original
material definition, which is not applied to any surface, should not
affect the ambient calulation.

d) direct+indirect with -ae copy:

rtrace -ov -I+ -h -ab 3 -av 0 0 0 -ae copy test.oct

This should give a zero reading, just as case a), as the light can be
received only by the diffuse walls, which have their modifier excluded
from the ambient calculation.

Initial expectations:
a) = d) = 0
b) = c) < 0

The results are:
a) 0.000000e+00	0.000000e+00	0.000000e+00
b) 3.035680e-03	3.035680e-03	3.035680e-03
c) 3.203512e-03	3.203512e-03	3.203512e-03
d) 2.749251e-03	2.749251e-03	2.749251e-03

The difference between c) and b) is due to the default sampling
algorithm, so switching to -u- leads to equal values:

a) 0.000000e+00	0.000000e+00	0.000000e+00
b) 3.159767e-03	3.159767e-03	3.159767e-03
c) 3.159767e-03	3.159767e-03	3.159767e-03
d) 2.845761e-03	2.845761e-03	2.845761e-03

Still, d) is obviously non-zero. Why? So is that 2.85 the result of the
diffuse-direct calculation, which is not affected by the -ae option?
That would mean that even though specularity is zero, rays reflected
from the (invisible) test surface introduced by the -I+ switch towards
the ceiling receive a value from there, which results from the direct
calculation at the ceiling. Setting all -ab 1 leads to an identical
result for a), b), c) and d):

b1) 2.845761e-03	2.845761e-03	2.845761e-03

Now, the one ambient bounce is "used up" by the reflection from the test
surface introduced by -I+, rays send out from there only return values
from the direct calculation at the next intersection point.

I hope my conclusions are correct. If they are, it may useful to share
this for others looking into using the ambient include / exclude options.

Cheers, Lars.

Hi Lars,

Your analysis is correct.  The interior surfaces in your test box do not participate in the ambient calculation when you exclude them.  This is not the same result you would get if they were completely "black."  It only means that the -av value is substituted for an indirect calculation at that point.  The direct calculation proceeds at all diffuse surfaces, so your initial sampling from your test point using -I+ will see a bright ceiling.

Cheers,
-Greg

Hi all

I have a question about Three-Phase Method Tutorial.

I'm trying to make Transmission Matrix.
I'm using WINDOW7.
I made new glass to resarch for the influence of visible transmission. After I set the Trans,Front Trans,Back ect.. I conducted the calculation by Calc [F9] button. Following error massage came out to me. How can I solve it?

One of the layers for Glazing System 1 does not have detailed spectral data or the spectral data analysis was disabled in Preferences. This may result in incorrect results for optical properties such as SHGC and TVIS. Custom layers with detailed spectral data can be created in Optics and imported into the Window Library


I attatched my situation.

For what I understand, that is not an error, it is more like a warning...
what I mean is that you can still use that for the Three-phase method.

I tend to think that the calculations may be spectrally-averaged, wich may
be important or not depending on the level of spectral-selectivity of the
glazing you are using.


Lets wait and see what the expert say anyway.

Best Regards,

German

Hi German,


Thank you for your advice.

But when the warning occured, I can't make xml file for?Three-phase method.

Of course, the data prepared by WINDOW doesn't cause the warning, I find the warning just by the data we made.

mmm, I am not sure... I think I have seen that warning, but I think it
never caused me trouble. I have never imported a layer anyway.

Good luck!

Hi Ogata,

It looks like you are trying to create a BSDF for a single layer system,
where the single layer is a shading layer.  Unfortunately, this can't be
done in Window.  There's really no reason Window couldn't do the optical
calculations for a single shading layer, but Window can't do thermal
calculations for a system that allows free air movement through.  And since
Window has one "calculate" button that does everything single layer shading
systems have been prohibited.

The annoying work around is:
1. add a layer of glass to your system.
2. turn on debug output by checking the box in preferences/options - this
outputs csv files containing transmission and reflection data for each layer
3. copy the data from the shading layer csv file for front and back
transmission and reflection and paste into the appropriate tags of the xml
file.
4. fix other xml tags as necessary (for example you could change the
thickness but I don't think it is necessary for Radiance)

Andy

Hi Ogata,
After zooming in on your pdf I realized that you were doing it for a user
generated glass layer.  We've discovered that there is a bug for glass
layers without spectral data.

So your options until the bug is fixed:
1 -  you could use genBSDF with a single polygon and glass material.
2 - you could find an existing glass library entry with the same visible
transmission.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance Workshop 2013 @ NREL, Golden, CO USA
Message-ID: <FFF56A6D37A3A54F91A03601AC22DA3226113AAD51@MAILBOX2.nrel.gov>

Greetings simulationists, photon wranglers, et al.,

It is my pleasure and an honor to announce the 12th International Radiance Workshop, which will take place August 12-14th 2013 in Golden, CO, USA at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).  The format will be the same as in recent years, with the first day being full of tutorials and software demonstrations, and days two and three reserved for presentations of work you've done with Radiance over the last year.

On day one, we will have Greg Ward presenting on new features/functionality added to the Radiance code since last year's workshop, as well as a primer on BSDFs and their generation with, and use in, Radiance. Andy McNeil may even have a few words about an enhanced daylight coefficient method that Radiance is being adapted to utilize (those kooks at Berkeley decided three phases weren't enough). Jan Weinold (Fraunhofer ISE) will be talking about his glare metric (DGP) and his tool (Evalglare), while a mystery guest from Boise, ID will offer additional perspectives on glare metrics.  Kera Lagios (Solemma LLC / Lam Partners) will be giving a demo on DIVA, and members of NREL's Commercial Buildings Research Goup will be giving a demo on whole building energy simulations with Radiance and EnergyPlus, using the OpenStudio Application Suite and SDK.  

Days two and three are what *you* make of them, really.  Time slots for user presentations will be contingent on how many people we get to come out, but figure about 20 minutes per person. What has Radiance done for you lately? We all want to know/see! 

We will be webcasting the workshop, so if you can't make it out to Colorado, no worries, you can enjoy the proceedings from wherever you are, via the intertubes. We will also be recording the presentations and posting them online for future viewing.

This event will take place on NREL's main campus, in one of our newest buildings, the Research Support Facility (RSF) which is one of the largest net-zero energy facilities in the entire world. Daylighting was a core component of the integrated high-performance building design, and its performance was predicted with Radiance. Come see a real life example of the power of Radiance's predictive capability! We also have a nicely daylit cafeteria parking garage, and a new building (ESIF) housing first of its kind grid-level simulation and physical test facilities, and a rather zippy supercomputer which will be online by the time you all come out here. We'll try and tour as many of these facilities while you're here as well. More on the buildings, here:

Dear colleagues,
As previously announced we will be hosting the 2nd DIVA Day on July 15th, 2013 at the offices of Thornton Tomasetti in New York City. DIVA Day is a conference on the use of environmental analysis in design practice and research.  The full-day event includes a series of presentations and discussions, focused on how DIVA and associated simulation tools can be used in design and performance-evaluation workflows.  Sessions include introductions to new features by the DIVA Team, and research and case studies by practitioners at leading architectural, engineering and consulting firms and universities. This year, the afternoon will be devoted to an ?Educators Session? which will focus on ways DIVA is used in college and university architectural and building technology education. We are adding presenters daily. For more information on DIVA Day 2013 click here<http://diva4rhino.com/diva-day-2013/agenda>. Early bird registration will end on June 14.
Best regards,

Hi-

I am giving a presentation about "what radiance is" to a non-technical
audience in a few days from now, and it came to my attention while making
the presentation...I don't know how Radiance is supported!

Does anyone have a standard sound byte about how Radiance is maintained and
funded?  Is it via donation only, or through NREL or other?

Thanks.  I hope I haven't opened up a huge can of worms.  But I am curious
for my own professional reasons as well.

Thanks,
Chien

Great idea. We had planned to use the test cases in CIE 171:2006 for
validating the Radiance implementation in OpenStudio, but this effort had to
get scaled down in the interest of time. I like the idea of hosting a site
(similar to Mark Stock's benchmark site
(http://markjstock.org/pages/rad_bench.html)) where individuals could report
their own results. I would like to throw NREL's hat into the ring for
hosting such a thing, with the caveat that Greg brings up about copyright
issues over CIE 171. Maybe some folks closer to CIE (John M?) could weigh in
on this. We could of course just post the results, and anyone wishing to
either perform the validations or to understand the meaning behind the
results would have to get their hands on the document. That doesn't seem
like too much of a burden to software developers or to scholars of lighting
simulation, after all.

My friend and fellow lighting software author, Ian Ashdown, gave me the
following message for the Radiance community.  

Ian is responsible for the creation and development of the AGi32 simulation
engine, which is widely regarded in the lighting design community (for good
reason).  He has suggested that it would be a good idea for one or more
persons to undertake a validation of Radiance based on CIE 171:2006, a suite
of sample lighting scenes with known numerical solutions.  I believe
Radiance has been partially validated against this dataset.  In particular,
Mike Donn posted a request for more information with a couple of references
to others' work along these lines in 2011:

	
http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-September/008
173.html

(Corrected links from post:
<http://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2008-fribourg/Content/Ge
isler-Moroder/RW2008_DGM_AD.pdf> and
<http://www.ibpsa.org/proceedings/BS2011/P_1146.pdf>)

I don't know of anyone who has gone through the entire CIE 171 test set, but
this is what Ian proposes.  Note that there are some tests to watch out for,
and whoever works on this will probably be talking to me at multiple points.
I look forward to learning something new in the conversation.

One way to approach this would be to set up a wiki or plone site where
individuals could upload their validation tests and open them up for
comments.  This would require some public documentation of the CIE 171
tests, and this is where it all gets a bit fuzzy.  I don't have this
document and if we were to purchase it, I am uncertain as to the legality of
sharing (portions of) it.

Ideas and further suggestions are welcome.

Cheers,
-Greg

This is an academic  challenge for the Radiance community.

Validation of lighting design and analysis software has been an issue within
the architectural lighting design community since the first commercial
programs were released in the 1980s. Several studies were performed for
physical spaces, the most notable being:

   DiLaura, D. L., D. P. Igoe, P. G. Samara, and A. M. Smith. 1988.
"Verifying the Applicability of Computer Generated Pictures to Lighting
Design," Journal of the Illuminating Engineering Society 17(1):36-61.

where the authors constructed and measured the proverbial empty rectangular
room while carefully monitoring and controlling photometer calibration,
ambient temperature, luminaire voltage, ballast-lamp photometric factors,
lamp burn-in and other light loss factors, surface reflectances, accurate
photometric data reports, and other issues.

Such studies are useful for interior lighting designs, but considerably less
so for daylight studies where it is nearly impossible to measure, let alone
control, the sky conditions.

They are also mostly pointless for complex spaces with occlusions and
non-diffuse reflective surfaces. Regardless of how carefully the room
parameters might be modeled and controlled, the results only apply to that
particular space.

The alternative is to develop a series of test cases with known analytic
solutions based on radiative flux transfer theory. This became the premise
for:

   Maamari, F., M. Fontoynont, and N. Adra. 2006. "Application of the CIE
Test Cases to Assess the Accuracy of Lighting Computer Programs," Energy and
Buildings 38:869-877.

and:

   CIE 171:2006, "Test Cases to Assess the Accuracy of Lighting Computer
Programs." Wein, Austria: Commission International de l'Eclairage.

At least lighting software companies,  DIAL (www.dial.de) and Lighting
Analysts (www.agi32.com), validated their software products with respect to
CIE 171:2006. It does not appear however that anyone has done this for
Radiance.

As a Radiance community member, you may rightly ask, "Is this even
necessary?" Numerous studies have demonstrated the accuracy and reliability
of Radiance, which may rightly claim the title of being the gold standard
for lighting simulation software. (I am saying this as the Senior Research
Scientist for Lighting Analysts, by the way.)

My answer is yes, but not for the reasons you might think.

Lighting Analysts engaged an independent third party called Dau Design &
Consulting (www.dau.ca/ddci ) to perform the CIE 171 validation tests using
AGi32 in 2007. The full report is available here:

www.agi32.com/Downloads/TechnicalDocs/Report%20on%20AGI%2032%20validation%20
of%20CIE%20171_Compiled_070620.pdf.

What was interesting about the tests was that AGi32 failed a number of them
on the first pass. As simple as they are, the results were dependent on such
things as the surface meshing parameters and convergence limits (for
radiosity calculations). Roughly equivalent parameters for ray tracing would
be the number of rays and the number of reflections.

It was easy enough to optimize the parameters obtain the best results, which
is what an experienced user would likely do anyhow for complex environments.

Note that I said "experienced user"; that is, someone who has learned by
trial and error what works best for a given software product. CIE 171:2006
has the potential (so far unrealized) of providing beginning users with a
cookbook of sorts to document and choose the best rendering parameters for
various situations. This alone would be valuable, but it becomes even more
useful when the user needs to work with two or more lighting simulation
programs and hopefully obtain similar results.

Validating AGi32 against CIE 171:2006 also led to a few puzzles where no
amount of parameter tweaking produced acceptable results. Further in-depth
analysis proved that the tests themselves were incorrect, being based in
invalid assumptions. These are documented in the report, but sadly CIE
Division 3 has not seen the need to issue an amendment to CIE 171. There are
at least also two other tests (5.13 and 5.14) that have been called into
question.

These issues notwithstanding, CIE 171:2006 is a useful document, which leads
to the academic challenge ...

Validation of Radiance against CIE 171:2006 involves more than just setting
up a few simple models and running the tests. There will undoubtedly be test
cases where the calculated results do not even begin to agree with the
published results. Optimizing the program parameters will demand an in-depth
understanding of what they actually mean and do, and so offer a valuable
learning experience for students doing for example a class project.

Digging deeper, there will likely be other issues with the test cases where
invalid assumptions lead to incorrect published results, subtle or
otherwise. Just because CIE 171:2006 was derived from a PhD thesis does not
mean that it is entirely correct. This, combined with proposals for more
rigorous and comprehensive tests, could form the basis for an interesting
MSc thesis. (The tests are mostly derived from radiative flux transfer
theory and as such are aimed at radiosity-based methods. If these are not
suitable for ray tracing methods, what would be reasonable equivalent
tests?)

Finally, it would alleviate a lot of angst regarding lighting software
validation in the architectural lighting design community if the major
commercial and open source products were validated against CIE 171:2006
(with acknowledgement that there are no overall pass/fail results). Ideally,
each company or software developer would conduct the tests in-house because
they know their products best. The catch here is that they would then be
expected to publicly post both the results and their test models so that
anyone could use their products to confirm the test results. This would
ensure that the test results remain valid as the products undergo continual
improvement.

In terms of Radiance, it could be a community effort, with various people
contributing test models and proposing best parameter settings. In addition
to providing a useful "best practices" guide for Radiance, this would likely
result in Radiance validating CIE 171:2006. It would also be welcomed as a
valuable contribution by the architectural lighting design community.

Greetings simulationists, apologies for the cross postings, yadda yadda,

The 2013 edition of the International Radiance Workshop will take place August 12-14 at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), in Golden, CO, USA. This annual event is a gathering of Radiance practicioners -- lighting designers, engineers, architects, software developers, researchers, artists, students, and educators -- where we show off our work with the lighting simulation tool known as Radiance (and the many that use Radiance). 

For those interested in attending the workshop (in person or via webcast), please visit the following url for details:

http://www.nrel.gov/buildings/2013_radiance_workshop.html

I hope to see you in Colorado this August!
