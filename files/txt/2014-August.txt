Hey Mo, I can share my results with you on this when I get back from vacation; I made a spreadsheet to calculate the views based on that code but as I recall I got some funky results. 

Also thanks for the heads up on rpiece in the windows packages, I'll make sure that's not included in the future! Oops...

Subject: [Radiance-general] optics2rad
Message-ID: <CAMrvT8cWiLvdiT0JN4OPmiYDQhSc6c0Q17kvXHeh8Fc2umBkHQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi folks,

I'm having trouble with an optics2rad conversion. When I run the conversion
script, it simply spits back the glass description instead of nice cleaned
up BRTDfunc. It works fine with other glass assemblies, so I think it's
specific to this description (copied below).

If the front and back reflectance values are close, as in this example,
does optics2rad simply say "don't worry about it, the RGB glass default is
close enough"?

Thanks for any insights - here's the export from Optics 6:

Law of the universe - once you decide to email the list, you'll figure it
out, and it will likely be a rookie mistake.

The outside pane of glass was flipped in Optics, and the low-e coating was
on surface 1. optics2rad didn't like that, and thankfully refused to make a
bad material description.

Hi Greg and Rob,

Thanks Greg. I did a test and it works like a charm for perspective views.
I haven't tested it for other types of views yet.

Rob, rpiece is not actually included in the recent Windows packages. I have
it there from an old release! Oops... ;)

Let me know when you are back so we can check the results. It works perfect
on my side. Maybe I should test more cases.

Mostapha

Good work, Mostapha!

This is really something that should be implemented in a .cal file.  I've just never found the time.

Cheers,

Subject: [Radiance-general] Trans material - tspec value
Message-ID: <CABL0RjfEbWVW9mx6QkrJ3EmfzaDS7D=+0xik80xaqrDy=-MRzw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

I am trying to compare diffusion properties of a glazing assembly by
rendering an exact same scene but changing only the 'tspec' value from 0
(ideal diffuser) to 0.9 (almost clear). I have a room with clerestory
windows which consist of 2 layers of translucent panels. Exterior glazing
is 60% VLT and interior glazing is 30% VLT with about a 30cm of cavity in
between.

*Simulation 1*
void trans panelext60
0 0 7 0.978494624 0.978494624 0.978494624 0.07 0 0.65934066 0

void trans panelint30
0 0 7 0.978494624 0.978494624 0.978494624 0.07 0 0.32967033 0


*Simulation 2*
void trans panelext60
0 0 7 0.978494624 0.978494624 0.978494624 0.07 0 0.65934066 0.9

void trans panelint30
0 0 7 0.978494624 0.978494624 0.978494624 0.07 0 0.32967033 0.9

rpict command is as follows,

rpict -vtv -vp 0.1 7.3 1.8 -vd 1 0 0 -vu 0 0 1 -vh 130 -vv 90 -x 3000 -y
1400 -ab 4 -aa 0.08 -ar 512 -ad 2048 -as 512 -ds .01 -dj .6 -t 60 sunny.oct
> lookeast_june21_noon.pic

I was expecting a significant difference in renderings for 2 scenes. The
second simulation should have resulted in more defined bright patches.
Though that's not the case. Am I missing something obvious here?
Unfortunately I cannot attach the complete renderings due to confidential
nature of the project. I have attached screenshots of the area of interest.

Any help is much appreciated,

Thanks,

Shri

Shri,
Have you checked to confirm that the sun shines onto the window in your
rendering? If not, then you wont see much of difference when diffusing what
is already mostly diffuse.

Message-ID: <CA+BymkajDdGwKtU-FwV-1Wf5wVY+bqApbD1p0_Oy9Vu99LaVAQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
Has anyone done any work with texture baking in Radiance? I'm looking for a
way to create a rendered, hopefully eventually animated, texture of a space
for use in a walkthrough video game. I found a couple references to
something like this in the archives, but only fragments. The best example
is this, which looks like it would work just fine if only I were Arup:
http://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2008-fribourg/Content/Guilio/Lightmaps_Radiance_Arup_GA_2008.pdf.
Any thoughts?

Thanks,
Trygve

Hi Trygve,

you can do it... :) Greg demonstrated an example where he used something 
similar to render caustics on the inside walls of a swimming pool. For 
each surface, create locations on it to achieve a sufficient resolution 
and render the illuminance at each location. Alternatively, for simple 
geometry, you may find the location and extents of the surface, place a 
vtl-type camera just in front of it, and render an image (clipping all 
pixels not belonging to the surface using the rtrace object id output).

It is a bit of work though... :D

Cheers, Lars.

Hello Trygve,

To create an "illumination map," which is really just a map of (u,v) texture pixels that correspond to RGB irradiance values, you need to generate the (X,Y,Z) Cartesian world coordinates and (Nx,Ny,Nz) world surface normal direction vectors for each pixel in your map.

Feed these values to rtrace as ASCII (-fac) or raw floating-point (-ffc) to create your illumination map like so:

	rtrace -I -fac -x $xres -y $yres -n $nproc $render_options scene.oct < surface_positions.txt > illumination_map.hdr

The first option, upper-case "-I", tells rtrace to compute irradiance rather than radiance, and to expect surface positions and normals rather than ray origins and directions.  Your input file (surface_positions.txt) might start like this for a wall parallel to the X-Z plane:

10.0	3.70	1.51	0	1	0
10.1	3.70	1.51	0	1	0
10.2	3.70	1.51	0	1	0
...
10.0	3.70	1.61	0	1	0
10.1	3.70	1.61	0	1	0
...

I think you get the idea.  You need to specify the -x and -y options to rtrace to get it to generate a valid Radiance picture, which you may then convert to another format if you like.  The -n option allows you to run rtrace on multiple processors to speed the calculation up.  If you are computing interreflections, be sure to specify an ambient file (-af option) in that case.

I hope this is enough to get you started.

I will release the code for uv baking at next workshop in a month.
with the promise that anybody using it and modifying it will share with the others.
No let?s focus on holiday time!
:-)

PS if you need this straight away let me know and will PM

Following a long alpha/beta period, Radiance 4.2 is official. NREL has created a release tag and binary packages on our git mirror of the Radiance source repository. Some noteworthy items:
* This is the second NREL release based on core RT code revision 4.2.b, and includes new Hessian-based error control in ambient cache.
* gendaymtx has changed to include a header on output, which causes an incompatibility with OpenStudio's Radiance-based daylighting routines. A fix will be included in the next iteration release of OpenStudio.
* This version includes the new rfluxmtx utility,  which should ease the pain of using rcontrib for 3- and 5-phase calculations, as well as a host of other novel applications.

Subject: [Radiance-general] trans material - tspec comparison
Message-ID: <CABL0Rjd7xZCcP1czEmKR1+b=_SzKEgrw6jBFkdCz+WfZMnonUA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

For tspec comparison,  I rendered the same scene for four different tspec
values of 10%, 50%, 90% and 100% (ideal diffuser).

I was expecting varying amount of diffusion, but I am getting puzzling
results. only 100% (ideal diffuse) value returns no direct sun-patch. All
the other values show a clear sun-patch in the space.

Any clue why this is happening? Would you expect such results? Everything
else is constant in the model. (images are attached)

Thanks,

Shri

Shri,

In the images you sent I suspect that the sunpatch is over exposed, so it
appears white in all three renderings. If you create a falsecolor rendering
you'll likely see that the sunpatch has different luminance values (make
sure to set the scale sufficently high).

One of the drawbacks of using Radiance's trans material to model
translucent fenestration materials is that the transmission is divided into
strictly specular and diffuse. The specular component is not scattered at
all, and the diffuse component is completely lambertian. You might have
expected the sunpatch to soften and broaden as the diffusion increases, but
with the trans material the shape of the sunpatch doesn't change as
diffusion increases, it just reduces in intensity.

To study diffusion like this, you'll really want to use a BSDF. Probably
also a tensor tree BSDF so you get sufficient accuracy in the sun patch.
And unfortunately LBNL hasn't measured BSDFs for diffusing glazing, so I
can't offer an immediate solution.

Best,
Andy

Hi Shri and Andy,

I think you can "spread" the "direct" component when applying a 
roughness to the trans material. Then, the scattered light is not 
lambertian any more. You can control the scattering "width" by the 
roughness.
You can see the difference then if you look directly onto the material 
(smaller or larger spot towards sun direction).  Getting different 
patches on the wall etc. is quite hard I guess. The reason for this is , 
that as soon as the "direct part" is scattered (when applying 
roughness), it is handled by the ambient calculation and it is not part 
of the direct calculation any more.

Using a BSDF with a fine resolution is in fact the best way to handle this.

good luck,

Jan

Ah, good point with the roughness. The only way I know how to get a good
value for the roughness parameter is trial and error it until it looks
about right in a rendering - which is probably why I avoid using it. If
anyone has an good method for setting roughness please share!

Thanks a lot Andy, Jan et all, you guys make this list amazing!

It was indeed trial and error. Unfortunately, I don't think I can offer a
decent method for setting the roughness yet - Only good news is that it
does change proportionally as expected.
Just out of curiosity, how much of an effort would it be (re time and money
both) for translucent glazing manufacturers to get the testing done from
LBNL?

Thanks again,

Shri

Message-ID: <7DDF4252-7226-4F43-882F-8389573114E7@yahoo.com>

Dear Sir/Madam,

Using Radiance, I would like to evaluate daylighting in adjoint areas in an atrium.

I could only find genblind that simulate Venetian blind. Would you please tell me commands that can simulate roller blind(diffuse reflection) and solar film blind(speculation reflection)

Is it possible to have a solar sensor to trigger Up/Down motions of motorised roller blind and motorised solar film?

Where can I find examples of Atrium?


Thanks a lot!
Stanley

Hi Stanley,

Your problem can be studied with Radiance and either a BSDF or
approximated with a "trans" material. It's not as simple as giving you a
command or two, unfortunately. As for the solar trigger, this too is
totally possible in Radiance ? but again, Radiance alone needs some help
to make this a painless and efficient process. I would look at SPOT,
Ladybug, Daysim, and DIVA for Rhino for said help. In the shameless plug
department, NREL is currently working on modifications to OpenStudio that
will also allow you to do exactly what you are talking about, applying
shade controls to different window groups in your model, and controlling
them -- as one of several options -- by solar setpoint trigger, and
integrating the contributions from several spaces to "shared" daylit
spaces such as atria.

Hi Stanley,

Your problem can be studied with Radiance and either a BSDF or
approximated with a "trans" material. It's not as simple as giving you a
command or two, unfortunately. As for the solar trigger, this too is
totally possible in Radiance ? but again, Radiance alone needs some help
to make this a painless and efficient process. I would look at SPOT,
Ladybug, Daysim, and DIVA for Rhino for said help. In the shameless plug
department, NREL is currently working on modifications to OpenStudio that
will also allow you to do exactly what you are talking about, applying
shade controls to different window groups in your model, and controlling
them -- as one of several options -- by solar setpoint trigger, and
integrating the contributions from several spaces to "shared" daylit
spaces such as atria.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Three phase method
Message-ID: <DUB127-W79A32AF59EDC762614C7DBD8D20@phx.gbl>




Hello all,
I have some more questions regarding the three phase method,
I understand that I cannot simulate bending pipes with the genbsdf. However I also need to simulate straight pipes that I think is able to be done. 
My question is if I need to specify the depth of the pipe somehow in any of the steps at the three phase method and how to do that. 
The way I create the geometry used at the daylight matrix and view matrix (meaning the two ends of the pipe) are in the "proper distance". But is this the correct way to do it (?) or the "entrance" of the pipe at the view matrix should be at the same position as the "exit" of the pipe at the daylight matrix (?) and then I specify the length of the pipe (that the "light" will travel through the pipe) between the "entrance" and "exit"? I suppose that maybe this way I could generate one bsdf of a long pipe and then use it for different length of pipes? 
Another question that I have is if I can use two different parallel BSDFs on one simulation.
Thank you in advance,
Vayia

Subject: [Radiance-general] cross check with rcontrib -V+ -I
Message-ID: <CAJ3JcAPoALPEZoeRg8NSadLNAOgzFfhY8Abcb93H+g5zSYavxQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I did a simple test to know if I understood correctly what "rcontrib -V+
-I" computes.

I created a scene with a light, the shape of a ring of radius *r*.
void light windowglow 0 0 3 1 1 1
windowglow ring window_0
0 0 8
0 0 0
0 1 0
0 *r*

oconv scene.rad > scene.oct

And I run the following command :
echo 0 *y* 0   0 -1 0 | rcontrib -V+ -I -st 0.15 -dj 0.7 -ds 0.15 -dt 0.05
-dc 0.5 -dr 3 -dp 512 -ab 2 -ad 4096 -ar 128 -aa 0.15 -av 0 0 0 -as 1024
-lw 1e-9 -m windowglow -n 4 scene.oct

By hand I computed that the resulting coefficient to transform the constant
radiance of the source (1 W/m2/sr) to the irradiance at the point (looking
towards the source) should be *pi * sin(a).^2* where *a = atan(r/y)*

So I do a variation of the angle *a*. I keep *y* constant (10m) and I get
this results for 2000 points.

What is wrong with the simulation or my calculus ? Why do the points spread
out at large angle ? Why do  the coefficients becomes small at very large
angle ? Does the source follow the Lambert's cosine law ?

Thanks in advance,

Sorry for my english,

Mario Geiger

Mario,
I think 'G' is right, -dj 0 should fix it.
Also, for large area sources it is better to use the glow instead of light
material partly because of the same sampling problems you're experiencing.
But also because if there was any geometry between your sampling point and
large area light source the results would be crazy unstable.
Andy

Hi Vayia,

You should consider using the new rfluxmtx to generate a transmission
matrix for your lightpipe the resulting matrix won't be in a BSDF XML file
format, but I don't think you need that format anyway. One benefit is you
can specify any geometry for the entrance and exit (genBSDF requires
parallel, rectangular ports).

A general (untested) approach is below.

Finally, I'm not sure what you mean by two different parallel BSDFs. Can
you elaborate?

Best,
Andy

Hello,
Thank you for the reply and the help,
About the two BSDF, I have for example a BSDF for the pipe and then I have one more BSDF for the top (or bottom) part of the pipe. Can I somehow merge them and use them both?
As for the rfluxmtx, is there any tutorial available? 
Kind regards
Vayia

This program seems pretty useful. Is there any manpage or something?

Also, is it possible to do something like this by modifying/re-writing
genBSDF script? I am not quite sure what was the motivation of writing a
whole new program. Could you elaborate a little bit, Andy?

THANKS A LOT

Hi Germ?n,

There is a man page for rfluxmtx, but that's about all we have at this point.  I sent Vayia some slides I plan to present at the workshop in London, and I can send this to others who are interested.  (I'm following my own recommendation not to include attachments in radiance-general posts, and my website is inaccessible at the moment for unknown reasons.)

Rfluxmtx was created to simplify common sampling operations used with rcontrib, and will ultimately be used to simplify the internals of the genBSDF script, which is a less general tool.  The only program rfluxmtx completely replaces is genklemsamp.

Cheers,
-Greg

But is this the correct way to do it (?) or the "entrance" of the pipe at the view matrix should be at the same position as the "exit" of the pipe at the daylight matrix (?) and then I specify the length of the pipe (that the "light" will travel through the pipe) between the "entrance" and "exit"?

Thanks Greg! I will have a look and check it out when I have time.

Will the presentations be recorded and published this year? I will not go,
but I would like to keep myself up to date.

THANKS

Yes, we are planning to record and possibly webcast the workshop.  People are working on it, and we'll make an announcement if there is the possibility to follow the talks live.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Mapping issue with HDR files generated from TIFF
Message-ID: <CAAd_PgTCCH7hAJvOWRZ+eARd69d4KtSkvwXgj_FqkP+7MKBbHA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Radiance community,

I'm doing a series of experiments for using a 3rd party 3D software (in
this case Rhino) to generate the map and render them with Radiance.

I made a workflow based on Giulio's suggestion (
http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-July/002851.html),
and it works fine when I use Radiance example .hdr files, however when I
use a custom pattern ( generated as a tiff image) and convert it to hdr
(ra_tiff -r) it doesn't map correctly. Looks like hdr mapping is scaled.

Is there some consideration in generating the tiff file or converting it to
hdr that I am missing. I tried to use pfilt and re-size the image to make
sure the size is fixed but it didn't help.

Here is a slide that shows the problem:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/eklns2rv5bv6tyj/RhinoVSRadiance.jpg?dl=0

Also the hdr file generated from tiff image in case it can help:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/o293dqh04ack1hb/random_pattern_1.HDR?dl=0

Thanks in advance,
Mostapha

Are both your images square (same number of X and Y pixels)?  Radiance has a somewhat peculiar way of handling rectangular images, which could cause scaling discrepancies.  See p. 259 of "Rendering with Radiance" for details.

Cheers,

Hi Greg,

That was it. Just rotated the image and it is fixed now! I should have used
a less random pattern to debug. I will update the workflow to mimic
Radiance's approach for coordinates.

Best,
Mostapha

Hi all,

As anticipated by Greg, we've planned to webcast the workshop presentations.

I am running a test tomorrow (26th August) at 6PM BST

http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Radiance+Workshop+2014+-+Live+Webcast+Test&iso=20140826T18&p1=136&am=30


Please join me using the following links:

Google Hangout:
https://plus.google.com/hangouts/_/gzewylk6crb4e7rclknogcocuqa

Webcast: http://www.ustream.tv/channel/radiance2014

Give yourself at least 1/2 hour before the webcast to sign in into Ustream
and Google+ if you haven't already.

If this works, I'll use the same links on the 1st, 2nd and 3rd September to
broadcast the workshop.

See you!

Message-ID: <569b51d05f7b3e7b2ad6444aaeec9c9@cweb18.nm.nhnsystem.com>

Hi everyone.
 
Is there anybody who knows how dctimestep works in three phase method?
When I tried to multiply as a normal matrix (with python language), the illuminance result is not matched with dctimestep result.
So, I wonder if dctimestep doesn't use normal matrix multiplication.
If there is a specific method in dctimestep, please teach me. 
 
* let you know, 
1. I picked up one column out of the every RGB(view matrix and daylight matrix), so that I made a simple matrix multiplication.
2. I created daylight matrix as a ASCII data instead of binary.
 
Thank you.

Jinsook,

DCTIMESTEP does multiply matrices, a pretty naive method, actually. I have
no idea what might be causing the dismatch between your results and
DCTIMESTEP's.

Nothing too helpful... sorry.

Bye!

Hi Jinsook,

Are you aware that dctimestep is multiplying RGB triples as though they are 3 independent matrices?

When dctimestep reads the BSDF xml, there is a conversion required for it
to be a true coefficient matrix. If you're giving it a BSDF, I suspect this
might be one of the causes of the discrepency you're observing.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Can you change the default colors in falsecolor
	images
Message-ID: <CABL0RjcFm0oeorEf6ivfS4B-vvwvZP=VYpEkYp-pV31O-B2jDA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

Got this unusual request. I am not sure how I can change that. Any
pointers?
Can I set custom colors based on say min/max and number of desired steps in
between?
I am looking at both Luminance and Illuminance falsecolor images.
Has anyone attempted that before, if yes, any examples?

Thanks,

Shri

P.S> Apologies for my past emails with attachments, I promise I will be
diligent next time!

Hi Shrikar,

I suppose you have discovered the -pal and -palettes options, but this 
still doesn't give you what you want?

You can create custom scales using the -r, -g and -b options.  Here is 
an example for a 3-step blue-yellow-white scale:

falsecolor ?ip picture.hdr ?s 5000 ?r ?if(v-0.3,1,0)? \
?g ?if(v-0.3,1,0)? ?b ?if(v-0.3,if(v-0.7,1,0)1)? > picture_fc.hdr

It requires a bit of cal magic.  You may also look at the falsecolor 
code for inspiration.

Best

Axel

HI Axel,

So far, I had not come across -pal and -palettes options! I will look into
it. Thanks for the command for the custom scales, that looks promising. My
initial reaction was I will need to tweak/play with the code for
falsecolor, but this looks like something I can actually do :)

Thanks a lot!

Shri
