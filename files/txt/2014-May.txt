Dear colleagues and friends:

My apologies to those who have already received this email.

Some of you might be interested in a new textbook called the Daylighting Handbook I, that I just completed. The book is organized into two parts, Fundamentals and Designing with the Sun. Fundamentals serves as a general introduction to daylighting, its implementation and its daily and seasonal availability. It also explains how light helps us to perceive the world around us and to maintain our circadian rhythm. A practical approach to building massing via rules of thumb is provided in chapter 5. Designing with the Sun introduces the reader to methods of how to determine where the sun is located in the sky throughout the year. Chapter 7 shows how this information can be used to design static shading devices. Heliodon studies using physical models are discussed in chapter 8.

More information can be found at www.DaylightingHandbook.com<http://www.DaylightingHandbook.com>. The book is available on Amazon.com<http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/069220363X> and/or the web site via PayPal.

Happy Spring Reading!

Dear Greg,

thanks a lot for the reply. So, piping data from rsensor to contrib  with
-I+ , makes  rcontrib to use measurement point position and direction from
the view file (as expected)  but ignores the rays emitted in accordance to
the sensor file. That explains the fact that the results remained more or
less the same when sensor file was replaced. Now comparing the results
(narrow versus cosine corrected sensor, overcast sky) using rsensor/rcontrib
3phase  method, without -I+, there is a difference (58%),  but it is
much-much less than the difference observed using rsensor only command.
Consequently, calculation of illuminance values  with 3phase method can be
done either using the standard method (measurement points to rcontrib with
-I+ ) or with the combination of rsensor (cosine corrected sensor file)
/rcontrib without using -I+ but with some "handling" of the rays emitted in
order to get similar view matrix files.


Best,
Aris

Hi Aris,

I am puzzled by your use of the -I+ option to rcontrib (first command) and
-i option to rsensor (second command). These options are very different from
each other, and I don't think you really want to use either.  The -I+ option
tells rtrace to interpret its 6 input values as virtual illuminance point
and orientation, rather than ray origin and direction as produced by
rsensor.  Using the -i option in the second rsensor command tells the
program to evaluate surfaces in your scene as if they were all Lambertian
with 314% reflectance.  Again, probably not what you had in mind.

Try taking these options off and seeing what you get.  The rest of it looks
OK as far as I can see.

Cheers,
-Greg

Hi Aris,

I'm having some trouble understanding what you wrote.  Perhaps it would be better if you sent me your commands, what you expected to get from them, and what you got.  If everything is as you expected, then we're done.  If not, then perhaps there is still a problem with your commands.

The rcontrib command knows nothing about view files, only measurement coordinates.  So, I lost your meaning in your very first sentence.

Cheers,
-Greg

Dear Hiroaki,

Although I am not sure what you are attempting to match or how you are doing so, but I can at least say that your view file is probably wrong.

The "-vtl" option specifies a parallel view, when you no doubt want a hemispherical projection ("-vth") in this case.

Best,
-Greg

Hiroaki,

I agree with Greg that it's not clear what you're doing, but I'm assuming
that you're using the climate data to create a sky file and then comparing
the horizontal direct illuminance to horizontal direct calculated from
solar angle and the climate data.

Integrating over pixels of a rendering is a round about way of getting at
illuminance. There's also potential error introduced by the pixel
resolution of the sun in the image. To address this you should make your
images very large (~4000x4000 pixels). Also I think you want to multiply
the result by 4, not 16, in your rcalc command (you have to multiply by
4/pi to counter the effect of the black edge pixels and also multiply by pi
as part of your hemisphere integration - pi cancels and the 4 remains).
 This plus fixing your view as Greg suggests should give agreement.

You might consider instead using rtrace with -I+ (capital i) and -ab 1 like
so:

rtrace -h -I+ -ab 1 -aa 0 -ad 10000 -lw 1e-5 sky.oct


Also gendaylit is probably a better option than gensky for creating a sky
from a weather file. Gensky will give agreement in this test, but the sky
generated won't as valid as one generated by gendaylit.

Best,
Andy

Subject: [Radiance-general] Uniform sky
Message-ID: <CACxzXYxU0YpUyK0D6a66ia7Es_ekrNJi5MtWuio1dbkZXypTog@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Radiance experts,
I want to get the ground truth pixel values of a scene generated by
radiance and I figured the best way is to use a uniform sky where the sky
it's 1,1,1...everywhere. The way I'm currently using is by specifying a sun
!gensky 4 1 12 +s -a 40 -o 98 -m 105
skyfunc glow sky_glow
0
0
4 1 1 1 0
sky_glow source sky
0
0
4 0 0 1 180

This results in shadows in the final scene. I found that -u option or -c
option can give me a uniform cloudy sky and maybe give me the ground truth
values. I tried both of them but always get 'no lighting source warning'
and a very dark scene when I try to use rpict and pfilt on the .oct
generated. I think I might be understanding something wrong. Could you
please give me a hint on this? The two options I tried are:
!gensky 3 20 12 -a 40 -o 98 -m 105 -u -B 100
and
!gensky -ang 45 0 -c -b 1

Thank you very much!
Best,
Vera

Hi Joe,
For the ground truth I'm thinking about just the surface lit by the light
at each pixel without any ray tracing. Basically, the RGB of the surface as
it would be if it were directly lit by the light without any
interreflections or specularities. I figured that a uniform sky would do
the trick.

Best,
Vera

Vera,

I am not sure this will work, but I would tune a gray "Ambient Value"
instead of using a Uniform Sky.

Try something like

"rpict -ab 0 -av 1 1 1 octree_without_light_sources"

A "pi" (3.1415) might be needed somewhere. But I think this is the way to
go instead of using a uniform sky.

Bye!

This sounds like you are trying to create something like an "ambient
occlusion" or "clay rendering"; the closer you are to an object the more
obstructed the view of the sky is and so the ground gets darker.

You can indeed create this using a uniform sky but you have to use "-ab 1"
for your rendering or the sky will not contribute to the scene. The "no
light sources found" warning comes up because a "glow" material that is
used for the sky technically does not count as a light "source" Radiance.

If you plan to use the rendering for analysis you can set the sky
brightness to a known quantity so that the rendering can be interpreted as
an absolute value of the obstruction of the sky. I think John Mardaljevic
wrote down the math for this in the Rendering with Radiance chapter on
skies/daylight. You should also add "-av 0 0 0" or the added ambient value
will skew your results.

Regards,
Thomas

Thank you all for the replies! I got it working now. I can see that -ab set
to zero indicates no indirect calculation so I think this should give me
the ground truth values. Thank you all very much.

Best,
Vera

Message-ID: <CAK21LWnh--XSxVSpNVWr27ERQWFcPzPJ4BeSQLqeeKX5H5pr8g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I have a noob question - What is the difference between rtrace and rsensor?
and which should be used when simulating real life illuminance sensors for
example for LEED IEQc 8.2 simulations.

I currently used rtrace and recieved results similar to the real life
sensor measurements, but with a result smaller by around 30%. Attached are
my comparisons - Results to the left (study case measurements) should be
multiplied by 10.

Thank you in advance.

Hi Bshara,

The short answer is that you should use "rtrace ?I" (that's a capital 'i') to calculate *horizontal* illuminance for simple workplane calcs, including the basic substantiation calc for LEED. This will give you the cosine-weighted integral of luminous flux incident upon the measurement point, aka illuminance.

Rsensor is a more sophisticated application of rtrace, which computes a sensor signal instead of illuminance. The signal is based on the spatial sensitivity of the sensor in question (or cosine, but most commercial photosensors are nowhere near cosine in their response), and the measurement point would be the actual location of the photosensor. This is how tools like SPOT and DAYSIM-PS do their thing. It's a more accurate means of simulating the actual electric lighting savings, since you're moving the simulation a bit further down the line.

Having said all that, horizontal workplace illuminance (where the "sensor" is on the workplace, looking up) is generally what is calculated. This is certainly true of LEED, and even EnergyPlus and in turn OpenStudio (currently0 calculate wprkplane illuminance and ASSume there is an "ideally commissioned" photosensor that properly responds to that daylight availability and reduces the lighting load. It's not perfect, but it's easier to implement.

One thing I'm also confused about with your poster is that you show views looking kinda southeast, and the plan shows this as well. If you are actually calculating *vertical* eye illuminance, you are getting a useful value for glare calculations, but this is not what LEED is looking for for the basis of satisfying basic daylight levels in the space.

As far as the 30% difference, it's hard to say if that's good agreement or poor, without knowing more about the model, particularly how you re-created the sky conditions for the model.

Thank you for your reply.

My view file was wrong. And it was a simple mistake.
Though I should have turned a viewpoint below, I took an upswing.

I'd like to study the distribution of solar radiation.
As a result of having noticed a mistake, I could get good result as follows.
1. Got parallel view by Radiance.
2. Picked original data by pvalue.
3. Calculated solar radiation (W/m2) by (R+G+B)/3*4*0.8
The value I got was same as the value that I input in gensky command.
But I did not know why it was necessary to multiply 0.8.
Someone, please tell me.

Best regards,

Hiroaki

Hiroaki,
Two questions for you, although I can?t really answer yours yet:
1. Can you describe your view and what scene your file ?t1_1.pic? shows? You still mention a parallel view, but Greg and Andy both recommended a hemispherical view (-vth).
2. Is it intentional that your ?skyfunc glow groundglow? definition includes the values 0 0 0 0 instead of 1 1 1 0?

Hi Bshara (& Rob),

> As far as the 30% difference, it's hard to say if that's good agreement or poor, without knowing more about the model, particularly how you re-created the sky conditions for the model.

For a real-world setting (with trees!), I'd say you were doing pretty good to get within 30%.  Is that repeatable for other times/days?  If not, it might be a 'lucky hit'.  Either way, comparison of simulation with measurements is a valuable exercise I'd recommend to anyone new to Radiance (or any lighting simulation program for that matter).

Cheers

Just to let everyone know, we have decided to hold the Radiance workshop during the first week of September.  The dates will be Sept. 1-3, 2014, in London at the ARUP offices.  This is a week later than the original plan, and was moved by request from some of the organizers.

An official announcement with the website URL will follow shortly.

Cheers,

Dear Greg,

Hi,

I am a beginner with Radiance and am working with the head release. I teach
in a school of Architecture in India. I was looking for a systematic
training. Will attending the workshop help me in this regards. I have gone
through the basic tutorials on the web, as well as the book Rendering with
Radiance. I have also gone through the earlier web uploads of previous
workshops.

Kindly advise.

Message-ID: <FFF56A6D37A3A54F91A03601AC22DA32263FE961DA@MAILBOX2.nrel.gov>

Hi Alpana,

Typically, the first day of the workshop is devoted to some form of tutorial, training, or software demo(s). The other days are for presentations by the attendees, on work they've done using Radiance, or tools they've developed that extend Radiance or use it in some way. Rarely has any of the content fit what I would call "systematic training", and I don't believe there's enough time in a three day workshop that is 2/3 devoted to user presentations and case studies to really do a top to bottom job of accomplishing such a thing. I will say that the workshops are truly inspiring, and spending three days with the inspiring people tends to spawn all kinds of impromptu meetings and discussions of the educational variety!

While it's probably not precisely what you are looking for, I would say that the workshop *is* quite valuable.

Dear Greg,

Hi,

I am a beginner with Radiance and am working with the head release. I teach in a school of Architecture in India. I was looking for a systematic training. Will attending the workshop help me in this regards. I have gone through the basic tutorials on the web, as well as the book Rendering with Radiance. I have also gone through the earlier web uploads of previous workshops.

Kindly advise.

Alpana

 match simulated and measured illuminance
Message-ID: <CAD7gt0Xe3bTXjTL57fpsH6SL=_Z-3hMBEyO8R8qeFdBzxhKCAQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone!

May I request you to please give some insight on the study I did to match
simulated and measured illuminance.

Draft report: http://bit.ly/1nCpjU3

Please have a look at the report.

In this draft report I have tried to explain the model, and results using
different statistics. Also I have highlighted some areas in the time-series
graph, where the model is systematically (occurring during the same time)
under-estimating the illuminance. I don't know why?

Do you think, there is still some scope of fine-tuning the model, or the
systematic error is uncertain to hypothesize?

Do you think the results correlate well enough with other similar benchmark
daylight studies that used Radiance?

I observed that the model correlates better in the case of "observed sunny
sky" as compared to "observed cloudy sky." But I couldn't understand the
reason behind this. ?

Request you to please ask me if I missed to provide any info. about the
model.

Thank you in anticipation.

Best regards,
Vaib

Dear Vaib,

I will prepare sky files based on sky scanner measurements for the period
you mentioned in your presentation.

The reason you get acceptable values for horizontal irradiance outside is
that gendaylit is based on direct and diffuse data therefore you will get
similar values in simulation. As Lars also mentioned distribution of
diffuse is an-isotropic specially in case of breaking clouds. So after I
send you the files please re-simulate again and let us know if you see any
improvement in interior sensors values in comparison to the measured values.

Cheers,
Ehsan

Hi Vaib,

There is a simple solution also to check if the errors caused by the
distribution of the diffuse or not. pick up the data for vertical
irradiance sensor and compare them to virtual sensors in Radiance. then if
there is similar trends as your result, you can infer that using gendaylit
model you cant get better performance as you already have.

Cheers,
Ehsan

Thank you Ehsan, Lars, Prof.Mardaljevic !!

Now, the reason behind weak correlation for cloudy sky conditions (with
measured values) makes sense.
Apart from that I couldn't think of any other modeling parameter (surface
property, geometry, or ambient parameter etc.) that can be tweaked to
further improve the results.

I have also followed all the modeling best practices mentioned in Building
Simulation for Design and
Operation<http://www.amazon.com/Building-Performance-Simulation-Design-Operation/dp/0415474140>
book.


I will go ahead and conclude the thesis research with these results. Better
results can be expected when sky-scanner is used to give better/precise sky
luminance distribution for the sky model.


Ehsan, Thanks!

It would be great if you can provide me sky-scanner's data, so that I can
have a quick test to support the conclusion. Will discuss more about the
vertical irrad. sensor that you said.

Best regards,
Vaib

Hi Radiance experts,
I'm conducting an experiment on evaluation of different algorithms to light
and colour analysis on materials. Previously we've only analyzed on
real-world scenes. And we're looking for to do some experiments on
simulation scenes and we figured pictures generated by radiance using light
simulation would be perfect. Currently the scenes I'm using are from the
tutorials of Rendering with Radiance. I'm wondering if there are any public
available datasets of built radiance models such as tables, windows,
chairs... that I could use? Thank you very much for taking a look!

Best,
Vera

Vera,

Just in case you do not find the answer (it would be good to find models
with well-defined materials and parameters); I guess what you can do is to
use any CAD program with an exporter. This should work in case working with
triangles (not continous spheres, cones or cylinders) is OK for you.

There is one called Groundhog project, which you can use to create your own
Radiance models in SketchUp. Also, you should be able to use models from
the 3D Warehouse; so you will have cars and/or furniture available for
download.

The project is still in development, but I used it and developed it during
my 2 year MSc. Thesis; and I guess it is already "OK" for others to use
it... It is free and Open Source.

http://groundhoglabs.github.io/Groundhog/



There are also other CAD programs/extentions that you can use with the same
purpose... SU2RAD, Ecotect, blender, OpenStudio, etc.

Any doubt, do not hesitate in contact me.

Germ?n

Hi Vera,

They are a bit dated at this point, but some older Radiance models may be found from the original Download page under "models":

You generally need to use "make" to build the octrees, etc., so hope you're OK with that.  If you don't have the make program, you can do it by hand following what is written in the included Makefile's.

Dear Lars, Prof.Mardaljevic, Ehsan,

Thank you for your last replies. It gave some ground to the conundrum I had
since long.

Could you please suggest me some reference papers etc. that further
describes the difference between sky luminance distributions of sky models
from Perez (gendaylit) and sky-scanner? Or something similar. So that I can
refer that in my thesis report. Thank you!

Best regards,
Vaib

Hello Everyone,

In the following report, the simulated illuminance (artificial lighting) is
un-reasonably high than the measured illuminance. I suspect that the issue
may be in the lumen output (or candela multiplier) in the IES file. Please
have a look at the report.

Artificial lighting report: http://bit.ly/1qXigtU

May I request your suggestions on how this issue can be resolved ? How much
shall I reduce the Candela multiplier, if that is to be done ?

Best regards,
Vaib

Hi Vaib

It is common to apply a reduction factor of up to 50 % to the light output
of a luminaire. This accounts for

a) reduced output of the lamps due to age,
b) dirt buildup within the luminaire,
c) failing lamps (in large arrays, if all your lamps are working you don't
need that).

d) probably something else that I'm forgetting right now


You also have to account for dirt on the walls unless you used measurements
for the room surface materials. In your case the reflectance of the ceiling
will have a big influence on the results.

The nominal lumen output of 4300 may also not be correct for your
particular type of lamp. Make sure you're using one in your fittings that
has the same specs as the test lamp, otherwise you have to scale the output
proportionally.

For fluorescent T8 fittings a total reductions to 75% output seems
appropriate (my quick estimate). You can look up the standard reduction
values for the above points in the lighting manuals (IESNA or SLL).

BTW: You seem to have table surfaces in your room. Usually illumination
calcs are done on an unfurnished room.

Regards,
Thomas

What command line syntax and options do you use with the ies2rad command to create your radiance definition of the light fixture? It could be an error with the particular manufacturer?s IES file, if they?ve somehow made the IES file incorrect in the process of normalizing the IES file and applying the 8.6 multiplier. In other cases IES files are sometimes reported with a candela multiplier of 1.0 (instead of normalizing them first). Can you test with another manufacturer?s IES file of similar distribution, efficiency, and lamp type (maybe Zumtobel Claris).

Thanks Thomas, Christopher

I have used "ies2rad -dm -t white -m 0.85 TX4948.ies". I will now check
with similar luminaire of another make, and also calculate a representative
Lamp Loss Factor as Thomas suggested.

Best,
Vaib

Hi Thomas, Christopher,

I used a similar luminaire of different make (Zumtobel Claris, Thanks!
Christopher), and it gave quite similar results to the initial luminaire.
That means that initial IES file was fine (even with Candela Multiplier of
8.6). I then reduced the luminaire's brightness to 50% (as Thomas

quite close to the measured ones.

Though I will calculate Lamp Loss Factor using the standard method to fine
tune the results further. Thank you !

I also used to do a quick parallel simulation in something like Dialux
that's specialized in artificial lighting simulations. If you feed it with
the same input values for maintenance factor and room reflectance you
should get a similar output as with Radiance. You need to be familiar with
these tools though because they have some hidden or implicit options that
you need to account for. But then, so does ies2rad, I think.

I'm late to this party, but I'd add that Axel Jacobs recently added a great Perl script to Radiance called "ltview.pl" which is useful for sanity testing your converted ies files in native Radiance. The script is available here:
https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/blob/combined/src/util/ltview.pl/

...and it's based on a thing I wrote a while back, which is documented here:
http://www.rumblestrip.org/2004/05/10/ltview-a-radiance-utility/

The idea was to look at the actual Radiance light source description that gets created by the ies2rad utility, in actual Radiance, so you are truly seeing what you're gonna get in a Radiance simulation. It's helpful for confirming orientation, distribution, and intensity (by running "trace" commands in the rvu window).

And of course everyone else who has contributed here is spot on. Photometry files are not magic, they are simply formatted data that can contain errors in assumptions and input. The user must know how to read them and be able to do their own fact checking. Familiarity with luminaire testing methods (and there's a big difference between SSL and non-SSL sources) and the IES-LM-63 specification, as well as the whole light loss factor issue which has been discussed, are critical to getting an electric lighting calculation right.

Hello Everyone,

In the following report, the simulated illuminance (artificial lighting) is un-reasonably high than the measured illuminance. I suspect that the issue may be in the lumen output (or candela multiplier) in the IES file. Please have a look at the report.

Artificial lighting report: http://bit.ly/1qXigtU

May I request your suggestions on how this issue can be resolved ? How much shall I reduce the Candela multiplier, if that is to be done ?

Best regards,
Vaib

Hi Rob,

You are right, its better to check the converted IES file, to have
confidence in what ies2rad has converted (as Thomas also pointed out). I
just did mine using ltview.pl, and it looks okay to me. Distribution looks
apparently similar to the polar diagram. I have included the image from
ltview.pl in the initial report on cloud.

Thanks for letting me know about the script.

Best regards,
Vaibhav

Hi Vaib,

just to add to Rob's comment.  There is also a new ltpict.pl script that
renders a four-view representation of the light output distribution of
a light fitting or IES file.

Conceptually, the ltview/ltpict pair is simular to objview/objpict:
One is interactive, the other renders an HDR image.

I don't think ltpict helps you with your particular problem, but I
thought this thread provides a good opportunity for promoting it.

Regards

Axel

Hi Dr.Jacobs,

For me ltpict.pl also have been useful as I can clearly check the light
distribution for both the orientations, in one shot. Thank you for the
scripts!

I've included image from ltpict.pl too in my initial report/slides.

Best regards,
Vaib

Subject: [Radiance-general] Zenith Luminance from rvu
Message-ID: <CAD7gt0XcRRJQJAK-uqSVOZNtY3g9LLb-7_Tq2o1_j=NBwWmF8g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Everyone,

I am trying to create falsecolor fish-eye image of just the sky. For that I
am using:

rpict -vta -vp 0 0 0 -vd 0 0 1 -vu 0 1 0 -vh 180 -vv 180 sky.oct |
falsecolor -s XYZ -l cd/m2 > sky.hdr

Dr.Mardaljevic in his dissertation said to set -s argument of falsecolor
close to the Zenith luminance, that can be obtained by rvu's trace command.

To get the Zenith luminance, I am tracing the ray (using rvu) that is
approximately at the centre of the image created with the above view
parameters, and setting this ray's luminance value as the -s option of
falsecolor.

Is this the right way to show/cover the whole luminance spectrum in the sky
? (It doesn't look so in the image..)

Or shall I trace the ray at the apparently at the brightest pixel ? (by
reducing the exposure, and figuring out that pixel)

I think the term Zenith Luminance may mean the luminance at the centre of
the sky, but I must take your opinion before concluding. Thank you!

Best regards,
Vaib

Hi Vaib,

Falsecolor now has an "auto" option to the ?s parameter, which will automatically set the top of the scale to the peak value found in the image. Note the peak value will not necessarily be at the zenith (which, yes, is where the vector 0,0,1 points to in a hemispherical fisheye view).

I also find that for other than overcast skies, using a logarithmic scale (-log 2) is very useful for getting the most value out of a falsecolor representation of a sky's luminous distribution.

Hi Rob,

I missed to mentioned that I tried -s a (auto) also. Also I tried to get
the peak value from pextrem. But I got skeptical as these values were about
100 times more (for sunny sky) than what I saw in some research papers; and
the image was just one color. :)

That's why I came back to manually tracing the brightest pixel approach.

Can you please elaborate on the "log 2" scale approach ? Thank you for your
time!

BEst regards,
Vaib

Subject: [Radiance-general] IESNA Files & LumBuild
Message-ID: <000b01cf7934$e1dad8f0$a5908ad0$@yahoo.com>

I'm curious how well have people been able to find IESNA data for standard
luminaries? I have been searching the web for candlepower distribution files
for standard PAR38 LED lamps you might find at your local home improvement
store, for conversion to an imposter surface.

 

I haven't had a lot of luck but I'm still looking! I came across Krzysztof
Wandachowicz's papers on calculating luminaires for Radiance, getting me
thinking more often the data might not be available and a measurement is
required?

 

Also of interest is a Masters Thesis by Randolph Fritz describing the
development of a luminaire modeling program called LumBuild. I haven't found
much follow on information related to the program?

 

Appreciate any knowledge you can share!

 

Thank you,

Brian

You should find .ies files to download at these links:

http://www.gelighting.com/LightingWeb/aus/products/technologies/led/led-par38/overview/<http://genet.gelighting.com/LightProducts/Dispatcher?REQUEST=IESRESULTPAGE&Category=Lamps_Sealed%20Beam_PAR&SearchType=CatgSearch>

Lots more out there? If you find Toshiba, they are no longer manufactured.

Hi Vaib,

Did you ever get this sorted? All I meant by the logarithmic scale is that by using one, you can get more mileage out of the falsecolor mapping, especially for scenes where there is a huge dynamic range, and especially when the gradients are all crammed into one or two small bands of the total DR. You can try it out by adding a "-log 2" or "-log 3" (whatever decades you need, really, but generally 2 works fine for most scenes) to you falsecolor command.

Hello Everyone,

Could anyone recommend how to best model a monocrystalline PV panel in Radiance?  Also, does anyone have assumed or actual reflectance and transmittance properties from prior experience as I do not have ability/time to measure the properties myself?

Thanks,
Kyle
