Dear Andy,
Thank You for your interest, I must apologize, as I simply copied the command from a diva grid based illuminance simulation: I changed the input parameters to -W (Global Horizontal, Diffuse Horizontal)and the output to irradiance "-O 1"(Watt/m2); of course having some mist doesn't make any sense as it is already accounted in the parameters I have as input (which are from a weather station nearby(meters away from the panel)).
About the approximations I just completely trust who wrote the code for Diva, now I will try without any and keep you up to date
Thank You very Much
                                                   Marco

Marco,

Puzzling. I'd suggest starting by adjusting the simulation parameters to make sure all ambient rays and direct rays are traced.

Here are the simulation parameters you used:
 -I -h -dp 2048 -ms 0.063 -ds .2 -dt .05 -dc .75 -dr 3 -st .01 -lr 12 -lw .0005 -ab 2 -ad 1000 -as 20 -ar 300 -aa 0.1

Here are the parameters I recommend testing:
 -I -h -dt 0 -dc 1 -lw 1e-5 -ab 2 -ad 2000 -as 1000 -aa 0

If that doesn't help I'd like to see your Solyndra.pts file.

On a side note, this is the second posting where someone is using the -ms parameter. Are people really using mist in daylight simulations these days?

Andy

Dear list,

May I ask advices on modeling trees in a Radiance scene?

Suppose I can get a so-called "*transmittance coefficient*" value for a
given type of tree through field measurement and then calculating the
average ratio of the irradiance below a tree to that above it for multiple
points below a tree under various types of sky conditions, what *surface
parameter * can I specify in Radiance for a simplified sphere surface
representing a tree that can use this "transmittance coefficient" as a
reference for simulation to understand the impact of the tree to the
surrounding environment in terms of shading?

Hope I explain myself clearly ...

Thanks!

Hi Joe,

If you want to model your tree as a sphere (on a stick?) with a certain transmittance, the "trans" material type should suit your purpose.  Parameter setting is a bit tricky, but since you don't have any reflection or scattering to consider, simply set values according to your transmittance T:

void trans treeT
0
0
7 T T T 0 0 1 1

I hope this addresses your question.

Best,
-Greg

Dear Joe and Greg,

Not sure if this is a question... there it goes though.

I was trying to emulate a micro perforated metal the other day (I do not
want to draw thousands of little holes!)... I tried to use TRANS equations
to derive the parameters I needed, but it did not seem to work. I think
TRANS properties vary with the angle of incidence?? (the percentaje of
specular transmission does no change with different angles of incidence in
a perforated screen)

I ended up using a mixture between VOID and a Plastic material, on which I
varied the percentage of "Void"... I am not sure, maybe that trick would
also help modelling trees.

Am I correct? Is, what I did, legally from the physical laws of lighitng?

THANKS

Germ?n

I think German's proposal is very clever for modelling a tree canopy "material". But if Joe is then using spheres for modelling the trees geometry, then the void percentage must be set to the square root of the tree canopy transmittance since a ray "transmitted" by the tree will always intersect twice with the sphere!

I hope this will help.

I see Rapha?l just pointed out what I was in the middle of typing about the square root transmittance correction. Also, keep in mind this will only be a very rough approximation for any measurements very near the tree, where rays passing through all parts of the tree get the same reduction even if they just glance the fringe of the sphere or other shape. In reality, rays passing through the outer fringes of a tree canopy would intersect with fewer leaves than those passing through the more substantial core of the tree (also depending on tree species).
I would love to here if anyone has a more ideal solution for modeling trees that is relatively accurate, and reasonable in terms of rendering time and use of RAM ? in other words without modeling every single leaf. If it looked nice that would be a bonus. Is this a possible application for something exotic like mist? I?ve never even investigated mist so apologies if that?s a ridiculous suggestion.

Yes, I should have thought about the square root -- good catch!

The trans type doesn't change with incident angle (unlike glass or dielectric), which is part of why I suggested it.  I don't know what's happening in Germ?n's case, but using a mixfunc with void and plastic is a perfectly acceptable approach.

As for varying the absorption using mist, a ball of mist might indeed have the desired behavior, as the absorption is an exponential function of the volume traversed using the mist material.

Cheers,
-Greg

Message-ID: <CABr=F_iRM4ytP=-fQyW2whaspNo3ZfsqGaTv8yN+SwtBJpmmiw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, I found that the hour values specified for the* -time* option of
*gencumulativesky.exe
*must be at least 2 hours away from each other, otherwise, it will generate
a .cal file with zero values for cumulative sky radiance.

E.g, the following *doesn't generate any .cal file* for the cumulative sky
for Jan-21 at 11am:
*GenCumulativeSky +s1 -a 1.37 -o -103.98 -m -120.0 -h 0 -E -time 11 11
-date 1 21 1 21 Z:/test/SG.epw*

... and the following *only generate a .cal file with zero values* for the
cumulative sky for Jan-21, 11am-12pm:
*GenCumulativeSky +s1 -a 1.37 -o -103.98 -m -120.0 -h 0 -E -time 11 12
-date 1 21 1 21 Z:/test/SG.epw*

But the following works for the cumulative sky for Jan-21, 11am-1pm:
*GenCumulativeSky +s1 -a 1.37 -o -103.98 -m -120.0 -h 0 -E -time 11 13
-date 1 21 1 21 Z:/test/SG.epw*

I understand that gencumulativesky.exe is designed to deal with annual
cumulative sky radiance in the first place, but it'll be good to find out
why it doesn't work in the "less than or equal to 2 hours duration"
scenario.

Thank you!

To Greg: May I ask, if I also want to consider reflection or scattering of
the sphere surface, how should I specify the parameters for the trans type
of material? and what does the "trans" parameter for trans material means?

To German: Thank you for the tip of using a mixfunc! Can you advise on how
to specify the funcfile to define the pattern and proportion of mixing of
void and plastic materials?

To Compagnon: Thank you for the square-root reminder!

To Christopher and Greg: Thanks for the tip on mist! Can we imagine the
tree object modeled in this way as a hollowed sphere whose surface is
composed of a texture with an "alternating void and plastic" pattern, and
the inside of the sphere is filled with a lump of "mysterious" fog ...?

Ok, so I can think of two ways... one sort of show "random leaves", and the
other is just continuous. HERE
<https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2NfkTSl19hQNjZUOGZzTkZSTjA&authuser=0>
is a picture of both. I guess the one that shows leaves is better, and
allows more interesting stuff... also, since it is random, I assume its is
also more realistic.

HERE IS THE FOLDER
<https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2NfkTSl19hQVHpKSmFRSFdNcXc&authuser=0>
with the files... just run the "run" file, and you will get everyting done.

Best,

Germ?n

Hi Joe,

The setting of trans parameters is a bit tricky and an oft-visited question that should be the first in a FAQ, if indeed such a thing will happen if it hasn't yet after 25 years....  If you do a search on the Radiance mailing list for "trans parameters" or similar, I'm sure you'll find some choice entries.  Maybe someone can recommend a calculator for you, but the basic formulae are given in Section 5.2 on p. 325-6 of "Rendering with Radiance," attached below.

I like the concept of using a mixfunc with void and plastic on the outside and mist on the inside.  Working out the appropriate parameters to get a reasonable look would be a challenge, but the results might be worth it.

Best,
-Greg

Hi Radiance community,

I'm trying to generate a BSDF file from a very dense mesh.

The Radiance file is around 8 GB and when I try to generate the .xml file
using gebBSDF it gives me the "out of object space error"

Oconv: system - out of object space: Not enough space error
> Could not compile scene



I found an old discussion about the same warning which suggests some
changes to source code (
http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/digests_html/v1n1.html). I wonder if there
is an easier way to address this issue?

A smarter solution is probably to create a smaller part of the panel and
copy it around (which is what I'm going to do next) but I wanted to make
sure that I need to do so.

Thanks,
Mostapha

8GB?! Uhm, yeah. =) Mesh is efficient, but an 8GB one will definitely give you headaches. If you can break that thing down to a smaller module and array it using xform you will be happier...

Are you using a Radince triangle mesh?  If not, try obj2mesh to convert it.  (Gensurf has a -o option to couple with it.)

Thanks Rob and Greg,

I use a triangulated mesh which is not generated by Radiance. Is this
something special about Radiance's triangle mesh?

I will try to break down the geometry. I was trying to avoid the edge
effect by modeling it all at once.

Radiance triangle meshes cut down memory requirements by a factor of three or so. If you can get your mesh into Wavefront OBJ formant, obj2mesh can take it from there.

Just to let you guys know, I faced a similar issue a few days ago, in a
very small project. Not sure how I solved it, though. I work on OSX
Yosemite.

It.is all I can say right now... hope it helps!

Mostapha,

You may have to simplify your mesh or output it at lower resolution and/or tile it as Rob Guglielmetti suggested.  

You can also try increasing some #define's in common/object.h, such as MAXOBJBLK then rebuilding everything using makeall.

maybe a silly thing but sometimes the issue is that every polygon is a separate mesh into the same obj file (I think rhino does that with some export settings).
try exporting a small portion and see if this is the case (open the file with a text editor and see), if so then the memory is taken by several repetition of the same lines and it is easy to fix.
anyway good luck, 8GB is quite a record for sure?   you may need to break it in pieces or reduce mesh resolution...

Thank you all. I created a smaller unit (OBJ file is ~84 MB). obj2mesh
generates a light mesh ~16 MB and genBSDF runs fine.

Message-ID: <CAGhWmF7R33E8d1O-gm6NfoqbiSAKNG9Yf9qkLLUYjH4ndh-sjg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, guys,

I don't know if you can kindly advise me on a Python related problem, or
suggest a source for help:

1. the following gencumulativesky command runs OK in the terminal of Mac OS
using London's weather file:
*GenCumulativeSky  +s1  -a 51.15  -o 0.18  -m -0.0 -h 0  -E  -time 0 24
-date 1 1 12 31 ./London.epw > ./gcs_London.cal*

... with two lines of error message:


*There were 4586 sun up hours in this climate fileTotal Ibh/Lbh: 0.000000*

2. But I can't get it working at all by running a Python script with the
following contents:


*import oscmd = "GenCumulativeSky  +s1  -a 51.15  -o 0.18  -m -0.0    -h 0
-E  -time 0 24  -date 1 1 12 31 ./London.epw >
./gcs_London.cal"os.system(cmd)*

There is no error message in the Python IDLE, but the .cal file generated
is zero ...


Moreover, I got a lot more error messages when running the gencumulativesky
program directly in the terminal of Mac OS X using Singapore's weather file:

Command:
*GenCumulativeSky  +s1  -a 1.37  -o -103.98  -m -120.0    -h 0  -E  -time 0
24  -date 1 1 12 31 ./SGP_Singapore.486980_IWEC.epw > ./gcs_SG.cal*

Errors:




*Error!  Solar altitude < 6 degrees and Idh > 10 W/m^2 on day 1!
Attempting to continue!......Error!  Solar altitude < 6 degrees and Idh >
10 W/m^2 on day 365!  Attempting to continue!There were 4354 sun up hours
in this climate fileTotal Ibh/Lbh: 0.000000*


Thanks for your help!

... to add a bit more info:

1. the same approach of using Python to execute Radiance programs works
fine on another Mac and Windows7 computers

2. I'm using *Python 2.7.9* for Mac

3. The Gencumulativesky executable is probably compiled from the source
code from Daysim3 ... but I'm not sure if it is the latest version ...

4. the Radiance is version *4.3.a.2* installed from
*https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/download/4.3.a.2/radiance-4.3.a-Darwin.dmg

Joe

I don't have a solution for your problem but on some previous versions of
Mac OS X the standard Python installation had "issues". You could try
installing a custom version from python.org.

Also, I recommend switching to os.popen instead of os.system. You have much
more feedback from the output stream and any errors that show up.
Converting the code is usually very easy.

Regards,
Thomas

Hi Joe,

I haven't automated gencumulativesky through Python, but I do a fair 
amount of automation of Radiance commands using Python. I find that most 
commands will not work unless you run the command with shell emulation 
enabled. I'm not familiar with os.system or os.popen, but this is an 
example of my process using the subprocess module, and I hope it helps you.

    import subprocess as sp

    process = sp.Popen(['pcomb', '-e', '(expresssion)',
    fullpath_hdr_fname, '|', 'pvalue', '-d', '-b', '-h', '-H', '>',
    'tmp.txt'], *shell=True*)

    process.wait()


Note that the subprocess Popen command takes a list of individual 
command elements, and the shell=True portion is crucial.

 > /Moreover, I got a lot more error messages when running the

Singapore's weather file:/
I am not sure where the 'official' gencumulative sky is available from 
these days, but we noticed an issue way back in 2012 thanks to some 
sleuthing from Ji Zhang 
<http://diva4rhino.com/forum/topics/gencumulativesky-exe-problem>, and a 
patched version was issued. Unfortunately, I only have the Windows 
binary of the fixed version, and the code is not open. A kind of dumb 
fix is to reverse your longitude input, as I believe the original 
version had issues with areas in the eastern hemisphere.

Best,
Alstan

One correction to my previous post -- it does seem that, as was noted, 
the source code is available with Daysim 3. I didn't know that. I would 
presume that this is the corrected version, but I do not know for sure. 
If flipping your longitude input gives you better results, then it isn't.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Three-phase method troubles: NROWS missing after
	rfluxmtx
Message-ID: <DB4PR05MB06886147C3E2FADF949EFE8FF42A0@DB4PR05MB0688.eurprd05.prod.outlook.com>

Hi all, 

I am following the latest approach to the three-phase method as described in Andy McNeil's 2014 Radiance Workshop Presentation, but when I generate view matrices my output is botched. 
With this command (I realise this is low accuracy, but for the moment I'm mainly testing workflow) :
	rfluxmtx -ab 4 -ad 5000 < ChEast.pts - windows_pts/window_00.rad material.rad ChEast.rad > viewpts_00.mtx
the header in the viewmatrix is as follows:
	#?RADIANCE
	oconv -f material.rad ChEast.rad windows_pts/window_01.rad
	rcontrib -fo+ -ab 4 -ad 5000 -faa -c 1 -f klems_full.cal -bn Nkbins -b kbin(0.525501,0.0136168,-0.850684,0,0,1) -m M-nor
	SOFTWARE= RADIANCE 4.3a lastmod  by nrel_nt
	gugliel on rgugliel-W7-VM
	CAPDATE= 2015:02:19 12:21:14
	GMT= 2015:02:19 12:21:14
	NCOMP=3
	NCOLS=145
	FORMAT=ascii

When I try to do any matrix multiplication to get the three-phase result, I get problems with RMTXOP or dctimestep, which complain they can't load the matrix. If I add the line NROWS=81 (number of sensor points) manually in the header, I do get results. But I'm trying to run the simulation for a lot of windows so adding this line each time manually or with a script is a bit painful. Am I doing something wrong or is this a bug?

Additionally, when I try to run dctimestep in annual mode, using the following command:
	dctimestep -n 8760 viewpts_00.mtx grate.xml daylight_00.mtx annual.smx > test.dat
I get:
	'fatal - unexpected EOF reading annual.smx' 
even though my annual.smx has 146 rows (for all 146 Tregenza daylight patches) and 8760 columns. 

Any idea what is going wrong here?

Many thanks,
Reinier

Hi Reinier,

You need to use the -y option to specify the number of rows in your
rfluxmtx run so you don't need to do it manually.

Cheers,
Mostapha

Thank you, Thomas and Alstan!

I need to check the use of Python's subprocess module.

Anyway, other than Alstan's way of constructing the command, the following
seems working as well. Am I using it correctly?







*import subprocess as spcmd = "GenCumulativeSky  +s1  -a 51.15  -o 0.18  -m
-0.0 -h 0  -E  -time 0 24  -date 1 1 12 31
./GBR_London.Gatwick.037760_IWEC.epw > ./gcs_LD.cal"process = sp.Popen(cmd,
shell=True)process.wait()print "OK!"*

Sorry, guys, it seems the following works in Windows ONLY.







*import subprocess as spcmd = "GenCumulativeSky  +s1  -a 51.15  -o 0.18  -m
-0.0 -h 0  -E  -time 0 24  -date 1 1 12 31
./GBR_London.Gatwick.037760_IWEC.epw > ./gcs_LD.cal"process = sp.Popen(cmd,
shell=True)process.wait()*

... on Mac the above only produces an empty .cal file ... (tested via both
Python 2.7 and Python 3.4 for Mac)

Neither do the following which generates no .cal file ...

*process = sp.Popen(['GenCumulativeSky', '+s1', '-a', '51.15', '-o',
'0.18', '-m', '-0.0', '-h', '0', '-E', '-time', '0', '24', '-date', '1',
'1', '12', '31', './GBR_London.Gatwick.037760_IWEC.epw', '>',
'./gcs_LD.cal'], shell=True)*

I'm suspecting something's wrong about the Python installed on my Mac ...

Anyway, it works in Windows at least ...

hi,

i unse radiance under OS system and i am now following Radiance Tutorial on the office website edited by Axel Jacobs.
i used compiled binaries to install Radiance on my mac.
what i am doing now is to run the command on p14.

i copy the command in terminal here:

lus-MacBook-Air:objects zhujiajie$ nano things.rad
lus-MacBook-Air:objects zhujiajie$ objline things.rad | x11meta
dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/X11/lib/libX11.6.dylib
  Referenced from: /Applications/Radiance/rad4R2macosx_bin/x11meta
  Reason: image not found
Trace/BPT trap: 5
lus-MacBook-Air:objects zhujiajie$ 

in things.rad:
void sphere ball1
0
0
4 6 5 7 2

there is no image.
what is going on here?

You need to install X11 on your system.  It isn't included by default on newer version so MacOS, sadly.  See:

hi,

thanks for you reply.
i now have already install X11, but when i try to get image there has another problem.

dyn1216-161:objects zhujiajie$ objline chair.rad|x11meta
fatal - cannot open file "/usr/local/lib/ray/meta/vchars.mta", mode ?r"

what is the problem here.
many thanks.

Are you using the NREL binaries? It looks like I may be building x11meta incorrectly, with some bad (hard path) link to "vchars.mta". I get this same error on my system; lemme look into this.

Hi Mostapha, 

Thank you - helpful! Where is this behaviour documented? I could not find it in the rfluxmtx or rcontrib manpages.

Hi all, 

I am following the latest approach to the three-phase method as described in Andy McNeil's 2014 Radiance Workshop Presentation, but when I generate view matrices my output is botched. 
With this command (I realise this is low accuracy, but for the moment I'm mainly testing workflow) :
	rfluxmtx -ab 4 -ad 5000 < ChEast.pts - windows_pts/window_00.rad material.rad ChEast.rad > viewpts_00.mtx the header in the viewmatrix is as follows:
	#?RADIANCE
	oconv -f material.rad ChEast.rad windows_pts/window_01.rad
	rcontrib -fo+ -ab 4 -ad 5000 -faa -c 1 -f klems_full.cal -bn Nkbins -b kbin(0.525501,0.0136168,-0.850684,0,0,1) -m M-nor
	SOFTWARE= RADIANCE 4.3a lastmod  by nrel_nt
	gugliel on rgugliel-W7-VM
	CAPDATE= 2015:02:19 12:21:14
	GMT= 2015:02:19 12:21:14
	NCOMP=3
	NCOLS=145
	FORMAT=ascii

When I try to do any matrix multiplication to get the three-phase result, I get problems with RMTXOP or dctimestep, which complain they can't load the matrix. If I add the line NROWS=81 (number of sensor points) manually in the header, I do get results. But I'm trying to run the simulation for a lot of windows so adding this line each time manually or with a script is a bit painful. Am I doing something wrong or is this a bug?

Additionally, when I try to run dctimestep in annual mode, using the following command:
	dctimestep -n 8760 viewpts_00.mtx grate.xml daylight_00.mtx annual.smx > test.dat I get:
	'fatal - unexpected EOF reading annual.smx' 
even though my annual.smx has 146 rows (for all 146 Tregenza daylight patches) and 8760 columns. 

Any idea what is going wrong here?

Many thanks,
Reinier

Hi Reinier,

You need to use the -y option to specify the number of rows in your rfluxmtx run so you don't need to do it manually.

Cheers,

Hi Reinier,

I don't think it is documented yet (or is it?). I had the same issue while
ago and Greg helped me to get it solved so that's why I knew.

You may also find Rob's implementation of 3Phase to OpenStudio helpful:
https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/blob/f2c750dd1edf65b03a17d32d62a22efbe5b84276/openstudiocore/ruby/openstudio/radiance/MergeWindowGroups.rb

Cheers,
Mostapha

Hi guys!
I am a student ?of a course about Radiance so I am quite new with the software. I looking for information an existing model of a cloud so I would like to analyses it and maybe i will try to improve it or to develop something similar.
I hope that someone could help me!

Hi Reiner,

It's true that this behavior is not properly documented.  If you can suggest a logical place where you would expect to find it, perhaps I can add the appropriate text.

Since rfluxmtx and rmtxop are new, the documentation is not as complete as it should be.

Cheers,
-Greg

Dear all,

Has anyone had the need and therefore figured out how to calculate CRI at a specific point within a daylit scene using Radiance?  Specifically I'm thinking of John Mardaljevic's paper on electrochromic glass where he used a spectrometer to get CRI of different combinations of glass tint.

I was thinking of using different HDR sky capture photos within gendaylit to simulate different sky conditions, and therefore was wondering also if there is a way to calculate CCT and SPD of these sky images with and without sun.

I'm in the early stages of scratching my head around all this, and as such may be barking up the wrong tree.  

Thanks.

Chris

Hi Greg, et. al,

Is there any chance that you can also add some notes about the headings.
There are couple of them in Andy's presentation for .rad or sky files (e.g
#@rfluxmtx h=kf u=+Y or #@rfluxmtx h=u u=Y). I wonder what are other
options available.

Best,
Mostapha

PS: Congrats Rob! Can't wait to see it flying in the wild! :)

Hi Chris,

I don't think there's an easy way to do this with Radiance.  If you have complete spectral information for the sky, you can perform a multi-pass spectral calculation by substituting the appropriate components and material reflectances/transmittances for your subdivided spectrum.  There are a few posts related to this in the list archives.  Try searching on "spectral".

Cheers,
-Greg

Eduardo,

I have done some experimentation with clouds in Radiance, and there
are two ways that seem to work.

One is to define a closed cloud volume and apply the "mist" material
to it. This mesh must be closed, watertight, and non-intersecting, and
will appear to be of constant "cloud" density. It helps considerably
if it's in the shape of a cloud. It can look something like this:
http://markjstock.org/graphics/ray/clouds04.jpg

The other method allows varying density throughout the cloud, but is a
lot more work. It consists of creating a large number of small,
non-overlapping cubes (a dense matrix of cubes with small spaces
between them), each with a different mist material applied to them.
http://markjstock.org/transfer/img2_00.jpg
http://markjstock.org/transfer/img3_01.jpg

These options seemed to create the most cloud-like volumes (with
clouds of size 1 and mist "voxels" of size ~0.01):
-ma 0.95 0.95 0.95 -mg 0.05 -ms 0.001

Those clouds are awesome!!

Not sure if useful for you (probably not)... But, why not using HDR probes
of real skies? And maybe, with your models, find a way of creating and/or
writing artificial probes?

Bye!

I have just started using this but try using -ip instead of -i and lose the
other parameters. See if it works and keep adding them back one by one see
where the problem is.

Hey Joe,

just tried this out under Windows and LINUX.  Works as it should.
What OS and version of Radiance are you using?
Also, try putting inverted commas around the label string.  Maybe your
shell doesn't like the '^' character?
If that still doesn't work, could you try without legend (-lw 0).

Cheers

Axel

Subject: [Radiance-general] Daylighting simulations for different room depth
Message-ID: <CAOn=hKH8k1pgyEdWrvjt1Vuq08dXs-AMk+q7uh85fBWDtVvL_A@mail.gmail.com>

Dear expert,



About a month ago, I have asked you about the design of an outdoor test
facility. Below some results.



Cell height: 2.7 m and cell width: 5.5 m. The transparent facade faces
south and it is divided in 2 windows, the bottom one has a fixed shading
system composed by simple lamella at 45? tilt angle. For the upper one two
systems has been tested:

- Complex lamella for light redirection

- Internal light shelf (width 1.2 m) with clear glass

The cell is located in the northern Italy.



The reflectance coefficients used are the common one except for the ceiling
set at 0.9.



I have performed three (one for each depth) annual simulations
climate-based with the 3-phase method. Then, the UDI index has been
analyzed (images at the link below). Observations:

1.    From your knowledge, are the results reliable?

2.    From the 4 meters the two systems seems to be equivalent. Can it be
since the systems do not influence the daylight trend from that distance?

3.    Until the 7 meter, the daylight trend seems to be equal comparing the
three scenarios. After, we have the largest differences.

4.    It is interesting to note as the UDI300-3000 on the 9 m pass from the
60% of the working hours (image 45 - 9m) to almost 40% (image 45 - 10m)
going under the UDI>3000 extended the depth from 9 to 10m.


Here the images:

http://s8.postimg.org/w22xxny9h/45_8m.jpg

http://s8.postimg.org/ht3bfljqt/45_9m.jpg

http://s8.postimg.org/fd1i1r1o5/45_10m.jpg



Any comments on the results?



For the next step, I would like to use a reflectance coefficient very low
for the bottom vertical wall.

Many thanks in  advance for the feedback.

Best,
*Giuseppe*

It could be that you need more -ab bounces, or more -ad rays traced in order to avoid the unexplained divergence you see for the areas farthest from the windows in the 10m deep room. This could also impact your drop from 60% to 40% UDI when increasing room depth to 10m.

It?s possible that the solutions do perform similarly at more than 4m from the glass, unless your lamella or your light shelf have special specular or prismatic materials or shapes intended to really redirect light farther into the space. By that distance from the window, the light has bounced so many times that the reflectance of the floor and ceiling probably have a bigger impact than either of two relatively comparable window systems. Or, at that distance the illumination could be reliant almost entirely on the view of the sky from each point on the workplane which could be similar for both systems at a distance.

Dear Christopher,


Thank you for the comments. As ambient parameters options I have used:

 -ab 12 -ad 50000 -as 2048 -ar 1024 -lw 1e-8 (following the 3-phase method
tutorial).

Otherwise, I think that the dropping of UDI due to the increasing of room
depth is not a strange effect. This because the contribute of the rays
refracted from the bottom wall is smaller.


Considering the ?ab 12, it can be that the reflectance of the inner walls
and ceiling have a bigger impact compared with the systems as you said.


I suppose that also the dimension of the upper window, compared with the
lower one, does not have a great influece on the inner illuminance values.
Here the dimension http://s5.postimg.org/ezlt60cp3/lab.jpg.


The goal of this work it is to analyze the daylight level in a deep room
using a system of daylight redirecting. Therefore, I would like to have an
effect of the shading system after 4 meters.

Maybe I have to test different systems in order to reach the effects
expected.


Another question: Considering the characteristics of a real product I have
created this material for the light shelf

void metal shelf_mat

0

0

5  0.98 0.98 0.98  0.96 0.01

Can it be realistic? Do you suggest to use also a mirror on the shelf
and/or on the ceiling?



Thanks again for the help,

Giuseppe

Subject: [Radiance-general] calculating CRI and CCT
Message-ID: <D3536CF8-7086-4DCD-9BD9-BB5380BF1C85@lboro.ac.uk>

Hi Chris,

The basic data and procedure for calculating CRI, CCT and others can be gleaned from this Matlab procedure:

http://www.lrc.rpi.edu/programs/nlpip/lightinganswers/lightsources/scripts/NLPIP_LightSourceColor_Script.m

Extrapolating from RGB to the required resolution is probably not for the squeamish.  I was going to try out the above-linked code to compare (Matlab) computed CRI & CCT with what the MK350 was giving me, but never got round to it.  For me, one of the 'take home' messages from tinkering with the MK350 (assuming the values are correct) was not to give too much importance to CRI or CCT alone -- much more informative to have the pair.  Better still, of course, the spectrum.

The SAGE Glass White Paper is available here:

http://sageglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/How_to_maintain_neutral_daylight_illumination_wtih_SageGlass_EC_Glazing.pdf

A journal paper on same has been accepted for publication by LR&T.

Cheers
John

	on Linux 64
Message-ID: <loom.20150226T113556-609@post.gmane.org>

I am definitely not an expert of Linux and do need clear directions to install 
BSDFViewer1.3_ubuntu_64.tar on a brand new installed Ubuntu in a VirtualBox.

For sure the sudo ./install.sh is not working. I have spend some times to 
figure out what is not working and then some times to find a post in which the 
full procedure is described. As I haven't found anything, I am now hopping you 
can help.

Thanks
Serge

Serge,
Have you installed Java?
Can you tell me what errors you get after typing sudo ./install.sh?

Actually everything was good, it is just that the shell finishes on a
warning and I haven't paid attention that's a warning and not an error. Fact
is the software seems to work fine.

Knowing that I have tried to install it on LinuxMint 17.1. There I had to
add -fPIC to MACH in the RMakefile and after the g++ in the install.sh . The
shell still finishes on a warning
"BSDF.h:105:8: warning: 'SDComp_s" has a field 'SDComp_s::func' whose type
uses the anonymous namespace [enabled by default] 
 struct SDComp_s {
        ^
"
Whatever, BSDFViewer seems to work well.

Thanks 
Serge

The warning seems to be a spurious comment on the fact that I am using an "unnamed" struct in Radiance.  There are many instances of this, so why it decided to complain this time, I have no idea.

Best,
