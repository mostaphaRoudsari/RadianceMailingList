hi comunities,
i'am studying a daylight of office building. It have 5 floors with rectangular atria in the center.
i will to prepare the model in ecotect to export it to radiance and to daysim for daylight simulation
My question is: how can i modelize a one typical floor with many adjacent offices? should i consider each space as a separately zone (for example : 
office1,office2,corridor, atria...) and modelize it separately?
a typical floor is given on attached document to give you an idea about my problem 
how can i prepare the entire floor correctlyfor daylight modelisation?
best regards
Im?ne

To reply to my own post, I had another generic office model sitting 
around, so I applied the same materials, same sky model and same 
rendering parameters, but the solar disc showed up this time. So perhaps 
it had something to do with how obj2rad was constructing the surfaces?

Im?ne,
Can you be more specific with your question? Is your difficulty in choosing CAD modeling software (plenty of previous posts on this if you search the archives)? Ecotect interface specifics? Setting up calculation grid points within or outside of Ecotect? Scientific/design methodology for your purposes (if so please clarify the intent of your study)? Other difficulties? If your questions are specific to using Ecotect to export you might try searching the radiance-online archives for the word Ecotect to get started, as there have been many similar questions before and only a portion of Ecotect users in this mailing list.

Generally speaking, the best thing to do is to break your building down
into the least number of daylighting simulation problems. I would define a
simulation problem as any space (or group of spaces, if they all can
"share" daylight) that represents a unique architectural daylighting
scenario. Look for unique combinations of form factors, orientations, and
room surface characteristics (e.g. room surface reflectance, glazing
transmittance). A row of offices all facing the same way could be reduced
to a single office model. If those offices all have access to potential
daylight from the atrium, then a model with the atrium geometry and an
exemplar office model for each orientation might work. Of course it's hard
to model the effect of atria on adjacent spaces without modeling a lot of
the building, to be honest; the effects of the atrium will vary
vertically, as well. But you can still probably reduce your entire
building model to a subset of modeling challenges for Radiance.

It's probably just being missed during the initial sampling, which is random.  Try setting "-ps 1" on the command line, or use "set ps 1" within rvu.

Dear all,
Actually, I am a new user of Radiance, so I have very basic questions regarding this software.?
First, I wanted to know whether it can be installed and used on Windows operating systems or it should be used only on Mac.?
Also, the older versions of Radiance can be used as a plugin in Autodesk Ecotect. So I wanted to know whether using Radiance with Ecotect would give the same accurate results as using Radiance itself.
Regards,Maryam

Hi Christopher and Robert,thank you for your answer.i think that i will to do ?three scenarios daylighting simulation:- the first is to simulate the quatity and the quality of daylighting given in offices by external windows according their WWR, the orientation of building ?glazing transmittance of window and climate characteristics (Tunisian climate)-The second is to simulate the quatity and the quality of daylighting providing by atria in adjacent offices and in different floors-The third is to simulate the quantity of daylighting given by glazing exterior office building to office adjacent atria when we have glazed wall in corridorhow can-I proceed for each scenario knowing that I'm going to do modeling geometry in Ecotect to analyze it in radiance software?

Hi Greg -- thanks for the reply. Indeed setting -ps 1 fixes the issue. 
At this resolution, the solar disc is actually ~5 x 5 pixels, so it must 
have been a very near miss with the default of -ps 4.

Best,
Alstan

I have a question related to this.

Does the PS affect numerical results? or it is just a matter of
"aesthetics" in the picture?

Yes, the "-ps" option can affect the numerical results, as small, bright (or dark) regions might be missed with the default setting.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Exterior Daylight Simulation
Message-ID: <000c01d09e22$fb137f20$f13a7d60$@gmail.com>

Hi,

 

I am a final year college student in London and my final year project is
about the exterior lighting simulation of Walkie Talkie building.

I was asked to use Radiance to do this simulation and I have already
installed Radiance in Ubuntu.

I have a copy of the book Rendering with Radiance but I found the copy I
have has a missing part, the 20 pages at the beginning of Chapter 6 Daylight
Simulation.

 

I would be very appreciated if someone could send me a scanned copy of this
20 pages.

Besides, is there any new tutorials or materials for new learners? I have
gone through the two tutorials in Chapter 1 & 2, a lot of code are now
outdated but I cannot figure out.

 

Regards,

Jiajie

Hi Jiajie,

I will send you the missing pages in a separate e-mail.

There is a link to tutorials from the front page of radiance-online:

	http://www.radiance-online.org/learning/tutorials

There are additional links to be found at the old website, which isn't linked to this page for some reason:

	http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/framer.html

Some of these are also a little out of date.  The man pages can sometimes help in determining the problem:

Hi Maryam,

It seems that no one has responded to your query, which is unfortunate.  We need a FAQ of some sort for these questions, but don't have one at the moment.

Radiance runs best on some version of Unix, but there is of course an installer for Windows as you noted.  I do not know the current state of Ecotect or whether it is recommended.  There are other interfaces available, such as NREL's OpenStudio and DIVA.  There is a fair amount of information in the mailing archives on both, and they have websites you should find easily enough as well.

Best of luck!
-Greg

Hi Maryam,

A Building Performance article on Radiance from way back (1998) may still be useful to help understand the essential difference between UNIX Radiance and any of the 'packaged' (i.e. non-UNIX) versions. Although none of the PC versions mentioned still exist, the general gist of the article still holds. The article was included as Appendix C (Chapter 7) here:

Subject: [Radiance-general] Confirm Procedure to Convert Spectral (SPD) Data
 to Radiance rgb color triplet
Message-ID: <AE55A995167B224DBBFA16500E3AB9B3047E09DF@NDJSMBX202.ndc.nasa.gov>

Dear Radiance Users,
I have a fundamental question about how to convert spectrum power distribution (SPD) of a material to its Radiance material counterpart. For now, I'm strictly concerned with the rgb color triplet passed to a material primitive. Below I summarized four steps that I believe accomplish this task. I would appreciate it people could confirm or provide comments on discrepancies in the procedure. Your input is much appreciated!
I tried the procedure with an experimentally measured SPD of a tan blanket, however my rpict rendering is showing a slightly lighter color than expected. I'm using ambient lighting (-ab 1 1 1) to view a rectangular surface modified by the material primitive obtained from this method.
void plastic material
0
0
5 r_calc g_calc b_calc 0 0

#1.) Obtain the SPD data from the spectrophotometer and compute the associated Tristimulus values XYZ. I'm using a CIE 2? Standard Observer for color matching functions and a D65 illuminant, as this is the illuminant used by the spectrophotometer.

[cid:image003.png at 01D0A2BD.9C2A4940]
[cid:image004.png at 01D0A2BD.9C2A4940]
#2.) Perform chromatic adaptation on the computed Trisitimulus values, to account for different white point definitions between source (sensor) & destination (Radiance) illuminants. For this transformation, the Tristimulus of the white point of both the source (S) & the destination (D) illuminants must be defined. Also, the Sharp color space is chosen for the chromatic adaptation transformation (Ref 1.), defined by the matrix, [cid:image005.png at 01D0A2BD.9C2A4940] .

[cid:image010.png at 01D0A2BD.9C2A4940]
[cid:image011.png at 01D0A2BD.9C2A4940]
#3.) Convert white point balanced Tristimulus values to Radiance sRGB color space. For this transformation, the chromaticity of the red, green and blue primaries and the white point must be defined for the sRGB color space used by Radiance. Radiance uses equal-energy white as its white point with the following chromaticity coordinates.
[cid:image012.png at 01D0A2BD.9C2A4940]
            Define the primary chromaticity coordinates for sRGB color space, obtained from 'xyz_rgb.cal' file within the Radiance source code.

[cid:image020.png at 01D0A2BD.9C2A4940]

#4.) Scale each channel by the measured reflectance of the material and by the luminous efficacy weighted sum of the input RGB triplet. An equal weight can be applied or the chromaticity coordinates of the green (photopic) primary can be used as RGB channel weights. The obtained rgb values are to be used as input to a material primitive definition.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Confirm Procedure to Convert Spectral (SPD)
	Data to Radiance rgb color triplet

Hi Andrei,

Your color conversions look mostly correct, except you have the wrong coefficients for the color efficacy at the end.  You used the XYZ coefficients for Green when you actually want the RGB coefficients for Y:

	(e_R, e_G, e_B) = (.265 .670 .065)

I don't know if this will make up the difference in appearance, but remember if you are looking at the results on a standard sRGB display that Radiance primaries are slightly different and a color transformation is needed.  If you are using Photosphere, the necessary transform is applied automatically, or you can use the ra_xyze program to get back to an sRGB color space before converting to a standard image format such as TIFF:

	ra_xyze -r -p .64 .33 .30 .60 .15 .06 .3127 .3290 result.hdr | ra_tiff - result.tif

The ra_bmp program can perform the conversion directly:

	ra_bmp -p .64 .33 .30 .60 .15 .06 .3127 .3290 result.hdr result.bmp

Alternatively, you can perform your rendering in the 709 color primary space, avoiding the need to convert back-and-forth.  Some of these alternatives are described in the following paper, which it seems you may have already read:

	Ward, Greg, Elena Eydelberg-Vileshin, "Picture Perfect RGB Rendering Using Spectral Prefiltering and Sharp Color Primaries," Thirteenth Eurographics Workshop on Rendering (2002), P. Debevec and S. Gibson (Editors), June 2002.

Hi Greg,
Thank you for the informative reply. Yes, the efficacies you mentioned make sense as these are the ones used to compute photopic luminance from radiance.
Using the ra_xyze & the ra_bmp command I can convert from Radiance RGB color space to sRGB color space used by common digital monitors. Converting the rpict .hdr rendering of my material to sRGB color did produce a much more realistic color. Thank you for pointing out this transformation, as I forgot to that the final rendering must be transformed to the display color space.
Kind Regards,
Andrei Kolomenski

Date: June 9, 2015 12:07:26 PM PDT


Dear Radiance Users,
I have a fundamental question about how to convert spectrum power distribution (SPD) of a material to its Radiance material counterpart. For now, I?m strictly concerned with the rgb color triplet passed to a material primitive. Below I summarized four steps that I believe accomplish this task. I would appreciate it people could confirm or provide comments on discrepancies in the procedure. Your input is much appreciated!
I tried the procedure with an experimentally measured SPD of a tan blanket, however my rpict rendering is showing a slightly lighter color than expected. I?m using ambient lighting (-ab 1 1 1) to view a rectangular surface modified by the material primitive obtained from this method.

5 r_calc g_calc b_calc 0 0

#1.) Obtain the SPD data from the spectrophotometer and compute the associated Tristimulus values XYZ. I?m using a CIE 2? Standard Observer for color matching functions and a D65 illuminant, as this is the illuminant used by the spectrophotometer.
X= ki=1Nx*SPDMaterial*SPDIlluminant
Y= ki=1Ny*SPDMaterial*SPDIlluminant
Z= ki=1Nz*SPDMaterial*SPDIlluminant
k=1i=1Ny*SPDIlluminant
#2.) Perform chromatic adaptation on the computed Trisitimulus values, to account for different white point definitions between source (sensor) & destination (Radiance) illuminants. For this transformation, the Tristimulus of the white point of both the source (S) & the destination (D) illuminants must be defined. Also, the Sharp color space is chosen for the chromatic adaptation transformation (Ref 1.), defined by the matrix, MS.
Tristimulus of D65 Illuminant?XW,YW,ZWD65T=94.811, 100.0, 107.304T
Tristimulus of Equal Energy Illuminant?XW,YW,ZWE.E.T=100.0, 100.0, 100.0T
Sharp Color Space Transformation Matrix?MS=1.2694-0.0988-0.1706-0.83641.80060.03570.0297-0.03151.0018
XDYDZD= MS-1LDLS000MDMS000SDSS[MS] XSYSZS

LSMSSS= MSXWYWZWD65
LDMDSD= MSXWYWZWE.E.
#3.) Convert white point balanced Tristimulus values to Radiance sRGB color space. For this transformation, the chromaticity of the red, green and blue primaries and the white point must be defined for the sRGB color space used by Radiance. Radiance uses equal-energy white as its white point with the following chromaticity coordinates.
Equal Energy White Chromatcity ?xW,yW,zWT=13, 13,13T
            Define the primary chromaticity coordinates for sRGB color space, obtained from ?xyz_rgb.cal? file within the Radiance source code.
Red Primary Chromatcity ?xR,yR,zRT=0.64, 0.33, 0.03T
Green Primary Chromatcity ?xG,yG,zGT=0.29, 0.60, 0.11T
Blue Primary Chromatcity ?xB,yB,zBT=0.15, 0.06, 0.79T
RGB= M-1XYZ
M=CL
C=xRyRxGyGxByB111zRyRzGyGzByB
L=LR000LG000LB
LRLGLB=C-1xWyW1zWyW

#4.) Scale each channel by the measured reflectance of the material and by the luminous efficacy weighted sum of the input RGB triplet. An equal weight can be applied or the chromaticity coordinates of the green (photopic) primary can be used as RGB channel weights. The obtained rgb values are to be used as input to a material primitive definition.
Channel Efficacy ?eR,eG,eBT=0.29, 0.60, 0.11T
Measured Reflectance ?R
rgb= RWRGB
W=eRR+eGG+eBB

Message-ID: <CAOn=hKE+vHqDm+LE7WjVYTEQZN8yO=u8FQcZwxmVeK=EY8ONPw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear expert,

I am trying to export 'by layer' and assign to each layer its material with
su2rad_v1.0. I have understood that there is a bug in the code and I tried
to follow the procedure in this discussion
http://radiance-general.radiance-online.narkive.com/kKC0HCmV/su2rad-rb-update-of-the-sketchup-to-radiance-converter
but without success.

This is what I have done:

- Add my materials in the materials.rad file in the su2rad folder of
Sketchup?s plugins

- Name the layer in Sketchup with the identifier of the material


Something changed in the ?su2rad export window?, since the layer/material
are displayed no more yellowish-brown but blue.  However, the materials.rad
file exported contains again the ?default_material? for each material.



Any advice? Thank you in advance.



Best,

Giuseppe

Hi Giuseppe

Thanks for reporting this problem. The 1.0 version (I assume it's
"1.0alpha") is a bit old and some issues might have been fixed in more
recent updates. Please try to download the latest release from this Dropbox
link:

https://www.dropbox.com/s/pewocv4df0i2i05/su2rad_2014.0.0.rbz

I am currently migrating my projects to GitHub as Google Code is shutting
down project hosting. The source code is already migrated but I still need
to update my upload scripts and create a new documentation page. I hope to
complete the migration shortly and will disable the old code.google.com
page to avoid any confusion.

Please report new issues via the GitHub repository bug tracker:

https://github.com/tbleicher/su2rad/issues

(I just noticed that a new issue has been reported there but I never got a
notification. Still requires some fine tuning.).

Anyway, I hope your issue is fixed in the 2014 release. If not, let me know
and I'll review the code.

Regards,
Thomas

Thomas,

thank you for the prompt answer. In fact, I didn't know about the GitHub
repository and I wrote my problem in the issues section of Google, sorry!

Going back to the topic, with the last version all works fine, thank you
again.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Blotching caused by translucent material
Message-ID: <DUB125-W62D679CB82BFB284307C799BBB0@phx.gbl>

Hi,

Can someone help me to set the Radiance parameters to eliminate blotching in my images? I am running renderings, DGP and glare simulations for a simple geometry. I have had no issues with the images when I use clear glazing. One of the tests that I am conducting, however, uses translucent glazing with the following parameters:

void trans testTrans007 0.478 0.478 0.478 0.000 0.010 0.178 0.635
I've run radiance with two different parameter sets, the first with
_av_ is set to 0xScale is set to 2_ab_ is set to 6_dc_ is set to 0.5_aa_ is set to 0.2_ad_ is set to 2048_st_ is set to 0.5yScale is set to 2_ps_ is set to 4_ar_ is set to 64_as_ is set to 2048_ds_ is set to 0.25_pt_ is set to 0.1_dr_ is set to 1_pj_ is set to 0.9_dp_ is set to 256_dt_ is set to 0.25_lr_ is set to 6_dj_ is set to 0.5_lw_ is set to 0.01
resulting in the image named Blotching001
The second case has the following parameters:
_av_ is set to 0xScale is set to 6_ab_ is set to 6_dc_ is set to 0.75_aa_ is set to 0.1_ad_ is set to 4096_st_ is set to 0.15yScale is set to 6_ps_ is set to 2_ar_ is set to 128_as_ is set to 4096_ds_ is set to 0.05_pt_ is set to 0.05_dr_ is set to 3_pj_ is set to 0.9_dp_ is set to 512_dt_ is set to 0.15_lr_ is set to 8_dj_ is set to 0.7_lw_ is set to 0.005
resulting in the image named Blotching002. I have also attached an image with no blotching. This case uses glazing with 65% light transmittance. 
Although the second case is much better, it is still very bad for hours when the sun is lower in the sky. The two above images are rendered for a clear sky at 18:00 in Germany.

Can someone help?

Kind regards,
Orn Erlendsson

Hi Orn,

It looks like the specular transmission component is sampled
stochastically, this happens because you have non-zero roughness in your
trans definition. To reduce the blotches in your sun patches you'll need to
crank ad, reduce aa and set st to zero. I'd keep lw at roughly 1/ad because
you want to heavily sample the window but with so many rays you don't need
them to split much further. You could also consider turning off the ambient
cache by setting -aa 0. This changes the effect from blotches to noise,
which sometimes has a better appearance.

Or you could change roughness from 0.010 to 0. I'm not sure how important
the roughness is to you simulation, but I don't expect it'll have much
affect on your illuminance result. But if you're interested in simulating
appearance accurately then the roughness is important.

I'd also suggest double checking your trans definition. It has a very low
total transmission (~9%) and is mostly specular.

Best,
Andy

Orn,
With clear glass, a very significant contribution is made by the direct sun, so all the ambient bounces (and their calculation parameters) contribute less to the scene, and you see less blotches.

For the translucent glass, try again with all of your first run parameters, but instead of -ar 64 try -ar 500 or -ar 1000. This probably has the biggest impact on visibility of blotches. This is particularly important if your model includes a room that's part of a much larger building, or a full building floor with a very large site context modeled around it.

In the parameters you tested in the second run, when you increased -ad and lowered -aa those should also improve accuracy, but might not be necessary depending on how much importance you put on accuracy versus calculation time.

I retract my answer. Andy is right about it being splotches in the direct transmission. I was too quick to jump to conclusions when I read your subject and barely looked at the images.

Chris, I think you're suggestion is valid, particularly for reducing the
size of the blotches.

Message-ID: <CAEV5NyeCS8xOv9eT1QJczUU=EmCaBPuAkSB=hEMs6KN0o8x2_A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all:
I?m learning Radiance and ran into an issue concerning genprism. According
to the book, I typed down the command below. Whenever I tried to oconv the
material1.rad & stool_1.rad, it gives me errors below. Someone using Linux
system can fix the issue by setting the PATH environment. I already set the
PATH, RAYPATH, and MANPATH in both .profile and .bashrc. I?m wondering if
there?s any other way of solving the problem.
Thank you in advance.

Try removing the "\" and just joining the lines in your file, like so:

 # using the modifier brown_satin_paint. create a polygon. named stool_top
 !genprism brown_satin_paint stool_leg_se  4  0.7 -0.7  0.7 -0.6  0.6 -0.6  0.6 -0.7  -l 0 0 2.5

I'm guessing that the Windows command line doesn't like the escaped newlines.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Errors while transposing with Rcollate.
Message-ID: <002f01d0a7c8$ada1bc20$08e53460$@psu.edu>

Hi everyone,

 

 

I am trying to do a transpose with rcollate. My operating system is Windows.
My file contains rgb triplets arranged in a (8760columns x 60rows) matrix. I
either get a "error loading file into memory" or an incorrect transpose. 

 

 

I found that I got the same results with a simple ASCII file with tab
separated values. My file contains:

 

1          2          3          4

5          6          7          8

9          10         11         12

 

 

The following commands return "error loading file into memory":

 

rcollate -h -fa1 -t a.txt >d.txt

 

rcollate -h -fa1 -ic 4 -oc 3-t a.txt >d.txt

 

 

I found that the '-t' flag was responsible for the error, so I tried
explicitly stating the values for columns and rows as:

 

rcollate -h -fa1 -ic 4 -ir 3 -oc 3 -ir 4 a.txt>d.txt

 

This gave me.

1          2          3

4          5          6

7          8          9

10         11         12

 

 

Am I missing something?

 

 

Thanks,

Sarith

Hi Sarith,

This seems related to the broken handling of text versus binary files under Windows.  Try reading the file from stdin, instead:

rcollate ?h ?fa1 ?t < a.txt > d.txt

If this works, let me know and I'll see if I can put in a fix.

Cheers,
-Greg

Hi Greg,

 

 

The command that you suggested returns the usage options for rcollate in
windows. (ie.  Usage: rcollate [-h[io].....)

 

Earlier, I had tried feeding the file to rcollate via stdin through using
pipe ( | ) as well as the 'type a.txt' shell command in windows but didn't
get it work either way.

 

 

Thanks,

Sarith

Anyone else have any ideas or suggestions?  Honestly, I don't know why redirecting stdin from a file would fail completely.  I thought this was supported under Windows.

I'm stumped.

Hi Sarith,

I just tried both calls (with and w/o redirecting from stdin) with the
latest Windows binaries from NREL(https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases)
and both work fine at my side...

rcollate ?h ?fa1 ?t a.txt > d.txt
rcollate ?h ?fa1 ?t < a.txt > d.txt

Which version of rcollate are you using?

Best,
David

Looks like a line endings problem. If I create an input text file on Windows and run rcollate, I get the "error loading file into memory" error. But if I create an input text file on the Mac, copy it to my Windows VM and run rcollate, it works fine with the first invocation David lists below. What I don't know about this crap could fill a book, but I am ASSuming rcollate lacks certain file type handling that other radiance programs have. (?) HTH, YMMV, EIEIO, TTFN

Hi everyone,


I am trying to do a transpose with rcollate. My operating system is Windows. My file contains rgb triplets arranged in a (8760columns x 60rows) matrix. I either get a "error loading file into memory" or an incorrect transpose.


I found that I got the same results with a simple ASCII file with tab separated values. My file contains:

1          2          3          4
5          6          7          8
9          10         11         12


The following commands return "error loading file into memory":

rcollate -h -fa1 -t a.txt >d.txt

rcollate -h -fa1 -ic 4 -oc 3-t a.txt >d.txt


I found that the '-t' flag was responsible for the error, so I tried explicitly stating the values for columns and rows as:

rcollate -h -fa1 -ic 4 -ir 3 -oc 3 -ir 4 a.txt>d.txt

This gave me.
1          2          3
4          5          6
7          8          9
10         11         12


Am I missing something?


Thanks,
Sarith

Hi Sarith,

I just tried both calls (with and w/o redirecting from stdin) with the latest Windows binaries from NREL(https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases)
and both work fine at my side...

rcollate ?h ?fa1 ?t a.txt > d.txt
rcollate ?h ?fa1 ?t < a.txt > d.txt

Which version of rcollate are you using?

Best,
David

Something else that is totally bizarre is that if I type your entry on the command line, rcollate crashes with an MSVCR120.dll error, but if I paste Greg's text into the command line it gives me the usage text - and they appear to be completely identical commands.  We are using  the NREL compile of Radiance.

Hi Sarith,

This seems related to the broken handling of text versus binary files under Windows.  Try reading the file from stdin, instead:

rcollate -h -fa1 -t < a.txt > d.txt

If this works, let me know and I'll see if I can put in a fix.

Hi everyone,


I am trying to do a transpose with rcollate. My operating system is Windows. My file contains rgb triplets arranged in a (8760columns x 60rows) matrix. I either get a "error loading file into memory" or an incorrect transpose.


I found that I got the same results with a simple ASCII file with tab separated values. My file contains:

1          2          3          4
5          6          7          8
9          10         11         12


The following commands return "error loading file into memory":

rcollate -h -fa1 -t a.txt >d.txt

rcollate -h -fa1 -ic 4 -oc 3-t a.txt >d.txt


I found that the '-t' flag was responsible for the error, so I tried explicitly stating the values for columns and rows as:

rcollate -h -fa1 -ic 4 -ir 3 -oc 3 -ir 4 a.txt>d.txt

This gave me.
1          2          3
4          5          6
7          8          9
10         11         12


Am I missing something?


Thanks,
Sarith

Let's take this discussion offline and post again when it's resolved.  At this point, it isn't clear if the problem lies with the build, the command-line interpreter or Windows system it's running under, or the rcollate command itself.

If you have some idea and want to help us work this out, write to me and I'll loop you back in.

Cheers,

Well, that was quicker than expected.  Just after sending this e-mail, Sarith wrote again and the problem seems to be resolved.  He had an old version of rcollate that didn't work when stdin was redirected from a file, but the latest works in that mode with -t but not from a file under Windows.  This was easy enough to fix, and the next NREL release should behave properly.  Meanwhile, Windows folks may have to redirect the input when transposing ASCII files with rcollate.

A tempest in a teacup, really....

Cheers,
-Greg

Hi Ikrima,

I'm afraid LEARNIX is no longer maintained.  You can still download the 
ISO image from here: http://www.jaloxa.eu/mirrors/learnix/index.shtml
but be aware that the latest release is from 2011.

Chances are that if you run it on hardware later than 2011, you will get 
problems, which are most likely to show up with weird display issues, or 
networking hardware not working.

To add insult to injury, the copy of Radiance that comes with this old 
LEARNIX CD-ROM is from, well... 2011.

You are much better off trying out a bootable UBUNTU CD-ROM or DVD.  If 
you read the 'Running LEARNIX' PDF, available under 'Documentation', 
you'll find a number of different ways of running LINUX alongside or 
within Windows.

Installing Radiance from the standard Debian or Ubuntu repositories is 
fairly straight-forward.

Hope you will succeed with you endeavour.

Best

Axel

Axel,
The Radiance package in Learnix may be outdated, but I think the standard Ubuntu packages aren't much better. Looks like Radiance 4R1 from 2012:
http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?suite=all&searchon=names&keywords=radiance
Picking a more current version from the NREL github seems to be the most user-friendly method to get the current version (even then you'll have to decide if you stick to the "latest release" version 4.2.2 from 2014 or to get the most recent bug fixes that are in all the successive versions following that).

Hi Chris,

thanks for pointing this out.  I tend to compile Radiance from source
on all of my machine, which is why I didn't realise it is no longer
maintained as a Debian/Ubuntu package.  Debian's package tracker lists
it as removed from Testing: https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/radiance

According to the package tracker, the following actions are needed:
- Does not build reproducibly during testing
- The package has not entered testing even though the delay is over
- The package depends on source packages which need a new maintainer.
- lintian reports 278 warnings
- Build log checks report 2 warnings

So that's probably the end of it  :-(

Best

Axel

Hi everyone. I'm definitely a novice at using Radiance, but I am trying to
run simulations as close to reality as possible for simple scenes. I have
the lighting and geometry down, but would like to implement defining a
surface with a BSDF material. I have the BSDF file but have no idea where
to go from there.

Any assistance on how to pass this or include this in the command would be
more than appreciated!

Thank you,

Subject: [Radiance-general] 5-phase method model reflectance
Message-ID: <9B4C0C5A-A4E8-4997-8360-1C4537273817@lunet.lboro.ac.uk>

Dear All

I am doing some analyses on reflectance values and I have just started using the 5-phase method for those.

At first I thought the reflectances assigned to the model would not matter for the part that is specific to the 5-phase, as the model is assigned a black material, but comparing the resulting matrices it looks like the Sun Coefficient Matrix (.dsc) changes with the original materials? reflectances (and it?s the only matrix that change). And that is exactly the matrix that is taking most of the computational effort (about 4 hours I think - the same model with the 2-phase method takes 5 minutes, glazing is all simple clear glass).

5pm_dsc.opt:     -ab 1 -ad 50000 -as 0 -lw 2e-5 -dc 1 -dt 0 -dj 1 -st 1 -ss 0

rfluxmtx -n 4 -faa -I+ @5pm_dsc.opt -y `wc -l < $prj.pts` < $prj.pts - skies/suns.rad $pmats/materials-$i.rad $prj-black.rad windows.rad > dmx/MF6.dsc
oconv $pmats/materials-$i.rad $prj-black.rad windows.rad skies/suns.rad > octs/model_suns-$i.oct
rcontrib -n 4 -I+ @5pm_dsc.opt -faa -e MF:6 -f reinhart.cal -b rbin -bn Nrbins -o dmx/MF6-$i.dsc -m solar octs/model_suns-$i.oct < $prj.pts

Am I doing something wrong or is this the normal behaviour? The data I get in the end are plausible. Could you explain why the Sun Coefficient Matrix needs to take into account the model reflectances at all?

I hope I managed to explain the issue somehow... Thanks for your help!

Eleonora

Message-ID: <D1A73905.1A4C6%Robert.Guglielmetti@nrel.gov>

Hi Chris, 

Version 4.2.2 is tagged as the "latest release" because it's the latest
*official* release. It's unfortunate wording, I suppose, but that's always
the way GitHub rolls. Indeed, there have been 144 commits as of this
writing since the official release:

https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/tag/4.2.2


So, yeah, ya probably want something fresher. =/ The latest builds, from
any source, will generally be based on what is technically alpha code
(hence the current 5.0.a releases); the Radiance source tree is never
tagged as beta for more than a day or so, and again when it's at "official
release" status, then it's back to "alpha" status. At NREL we append a
number after the code status (e.g. 5.0.a.1) when we tag for our alpha/beta
release packages, just to keep everything straight.

Radiance was incremented to version 5.0 recently in light of some major
feature inclusions such as the photon map, but there was never an official
blessing, so the latest "official release" remains the patched 4.2.2. But
for sure, v5.0 has some nice features, and Windows support caught up to
them ? and 64-bit support was (finally) added ? in the last month or so.
NREL will be releasing another round of 5.0 packages soon in light of a
bug fix that was checked in the other day which may affect more than a
couple of users: 

https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/commit/aa4541445b3988563331067f6b6e643bd73
33466


As we do not have automated builds set up (yet), we try and just roll out
new packages as-needed. For now, the version most Radiance users will want
is 5.0.a.3:

https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/tag/5.0.a.3


?5.0.a.4 to follow RealSoonNow.

The direct sun coefficient matrix only includes materials in your window
system, assuming you're using pass-through BSDF in you model. So it
shouldn't change when you change other materials. Maybe check that your
materials are actually black using rvu?

There are ways to reduce the amount of time the direct sun coefficient
matrix takes, the most useful is to delete the suns in suns.rad that will
never be used. So if you don't plan on changing the orientation or latitude
in your simulations you can delete suns that fall outside of your solar
band. Also if you're only doing hourly analysis, you could delete suns
between hourly analemas.

Hi Giulio,

A jitter of 100% will lead to aiming failure?

Greg (and David G-M) changed the way direct jittering works for round
sources so that there are no longer aiming failures (
http://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2009-boston-ma/Presentations/GW_RadianceImprovements.pdf
).

and also setting a specular threshold to 100% will mean no specular
> sampling?

You want to turn specular sampling off for the direct sun coefficient
matrix to avoid double counting in the 5-phase method.

Best,
Andy

Don't say that, Giulio -- I would have to quit, too!  I was also puzzled by the -st 1 setting....  (I still need to learn Andy's 5-phase method.)

Dear Christian,

I made a little GUI that I essentially use for my teaching of RADIANCE to
PhD students. It is called Geronimo and was developed during my time at
EPFL. The idea of the tool was to see the effect of complex fenestration
systems represented by their BSDF in typical office rooms.

In short:
- you can download the latest version (1.3) on:
ftp://kaemco.synology.me/Geronimo
- you can find some information and a guide on: http://leso.epfl.ch/geronimo

You have a main GUI window to give options and start the simulation, and a
little command window in which you can see the started commands. It is an
easy was to learn by trying the shown commands and looking at the
corresponding .rad files.

Hoping this helps,
Best,
Jerome

Hi Christian,

If you want to learn more about BSDF materials in Radiance check Greg's
presentation here > (
http://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2011-berkeley-ca/presentations/day2/GW5_BSDFFirstClass.pdf
)

There is an example for defining a Radiance material using an .xml file on
slide 7.

After you define the material you can use the name of the material similar
to other Radiance materials and assign it to the surface.

Well, that was quicker than expected.  Just after sending this e-mail, Sarith wrote again and the problem seems to be resolved.  He had an old version of rcollate that didn't work when stdin was redirected from a file, but the latest works in that mode with -t but not from a file under Windows.  This was easy enough to fix, and the next NREL release should behave properly.  Meanwhile, Windows folks may have to redirect the input when transposing ASCII files with rcollate.

A tempest in a teacup, really....

Cheers,
-Greg

Hi Ikrima,

I'm afraid LEARNIX is no longer maintained.  You can still download the ISO image from here: http://www.jaloxa.eu/mirrors/learnix/index.shtml
but be aware that the latest release is from 2011.

Chances are that if you run it on hardware later than 2011, you will get problems, which are most likely to show up with weird display issues, or networking hardware not working.

To add insult to injury, the copy of Radiance that comes with this old LEARNIX CD-ROM is from, well... 2011.

You are much better off trying out a bootable UBUNTU CD-ROM or DVD.  If you read the 'Running LEARNIX' PDF, available under 'Documentation', you'll find a number of different ways of running LINUX alongside or within Windows.

Installing Radiance from the standard Debian or Ubuntu repositories is fairly straight-forward.

Hope you will succeed with you endeavour.

Best

Axel

Hi Axel again,

Please let me make my enquiry more clear because I'm getting a bit confused.

I don't mind to use UBUNTU, knoppix, learnix or other operation system to run Radiance. By the end, what I need exactly is running Radiance (with almost all its programs) for two things:

1. generate BSDF for CFS to be used with Window7.3 tool.
2. calculate daylight levels for a grid points inside the space with same CFS.

To be honest, I did a lot of readings on how to do that but can't try that because I can't manage to install full Radiance package (I have already installed Radiance for windows but can't run genBSDF program, as I know).

I hope you can help me to sort that out :)

Regards
Ikrima

Well, that was quicker than expected.  Just after sending this e-mail, Sarith wrote again and the problem seems to be resolved.  He had an old version of rcollate that didn't work when stdin was redirected from a file, but the latest works in that mode with -t but not from a file under Windows.  This was easy enough to fix, and the next NREL release should behave properly.  Meanwhile, Windows folks may have to redirect the input when transposing ASCII files with rcollate.

A tempest in a teacup, really....

Cheers,
-Greg

Hi Ikrima,

I'm afraid LEARNIX is no longer maintained.  You can still download the ISO image from here: http://www.jaloxa.eu/mirrors/learnix/index.shtml
but be aware that the latest release is from 2011.

Chances are that if you run it on hardware later than 2011, you will get problems, which are most likely to show up with weird display issues, or networking hardware not working.

To add insult to injury, the copy of Radiance that comes with this old LEARNIX CD-ROM is from, well... 2011.

You are much better off trying out a bootable UBUNTU CD-ROM or DVD.  If you read the 'Running LEARNIX' PDF, available under 'Documentation', you'll find a number of different ways of running LINUX alongside or within Windows.

Installing Radiance from the standard Debian or Ubuntu repositories is fairly straight-forward.

Hope you will succeed with you endeavour.

Best

Hi all,

I am really sorry for writing on the same point again but really in-need for clear and complete answer, if possible.
Here, in my institution, people are in doubt if simple daylight calculation tools like Ecotect (both standalone Ecotect as well as Ecotect using Radiance engine methods) are efficient/enough for characterising different complex fenestration systems (CFS) and most importantly differentiate them for purpose of classification and rating?
Many are saying there's no need to go through Radiance to get almost the same thing that can be achieved using other simple tools (like Ecotect). For me, as a beginner with some readings and research, I found that Ecotect is still not efficient tool to differentiate different CFS (especially if they are very close in geometry, etc.) so we need something that's more robust like Radiance to do the Job; does that sound right?

Your reply is highly appreciated.

Regards
Ikrima

Message-ID: <CA+dqh62GTi7aijwpUh8xYTA1AsKE2WgvTyydYAESSL8YUDe7Wg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Ikrima,

If you need to run Radiance on a non-Windows platform, you can
essentially go MacOS or LINUIX (e.g. Ubuntu).

It's probably a good idea to rely in NREL's binaries:
https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/
unless, that is, you want to compile from source.  But this is rather
more difficult.

Your choice of MacOS vs LINUX will not only depend on the hardware
that you have available, but also on the support you can get from your
local IT support..

Have a look at the Running LEARNIX pdf on this page:
http://www.jaloxa.eu/mirrors/learnix/docs.shtml to see whether one of
the available options might suit you.  The document is fairly old, and
I never found the time to actually finish it.  I think that installing
Ubuntu into a VirtualBox virtual machine is quite a good solution.
This is how I used to run all Radiance jobs at my previous place of
work.  The big advantage is that you can Windows and LINUX at the same
time, but you need lots of RAM for this (I recommend at least 8GB).

Hope this gets you started.

Best

Axel

Ikrima,

I am going to try to build the puzzle of CFS, Phases, BSDF and
calculations.... at least the way I understand it.

*CFS* are those systems that, via interreflection or other light transport
phenomena, redirect light (or solar radiation). Thus, in order to get a
reliable result you will have to consider all the phenomena involved.
Then, *common
simple performance indexes*, such as the miss-used Shading Coefficient and
the Aperture Percentage, *always loose a lot of information, trying to
reduce all the complex behavior of a CFS to one single number*. We all know
that venetian blinds are more "transparent" from certain viewing directions
than from others, but these performance indexes do not tell you that.

Now... Radiance can certainly perform calculations of spaces with CFS using
its "common" Ray-tracing. However, this may be slow for some purposes (i.e.
annual simulations and climate-based daylight modelling), and *this is why
2, 3 and 5 phase methods have been developed*. The *BSDF* representation, I
would say, goes in the same direction... It allow summarizing all the
bounces, reflections, refractions, etc.  that occure withing the CFS in a
single matrix or tensor.* By using BSDFs*, Radiance itself and other tools
(i.e. EnergyPlus) can treat CFS as blackboxes, avoiding all the opcits
within the system. A BSDF that uses the Klems Full representation has
21,045 numbers (instead of one, such as the Shading Coefficient).

Being said all that, I would not trust a calculation method unless it can
actually deal with the optics of a CFS that is drawn and/or it can use BSDF
(or similar) information.

Lets remember that a perforated screen, a venetian blind, a light diffusing
device can all have a Shading Coefficient of 50%, but all of them will
behave very differently. I made some presentations about this on my
previous work (we sold complex Shading Devices), trying to promote the use
of BSDF in EnergyPlus calculations... the differences (in solar heat gains)
were more than considerable.

I hope that someone else gives us his/her perspective on this topic...
there are a lot of concepts that I might be misunderstanding.

Best!

Ikrima,

I have used genBSDF in Windows... what you have to do is the following:

   1. Install Radiance (add it to path... that is a matter of checking the
   option)
   2. Install a perl interpreter... I used THIS <http://strawberryperl.com/>
   3. Then, in order to use genBSDF (at least for me), you have to write
   the whole directory... What I usually do is just copy and paste the program
   in the folder where you are going to work in.
   4. run 'perl genBSDF.pl ....'

Anyone knows why the perl scripts are not recognized as part of the PATH?

Hope it helps!

Bye

Subject: [Radiance-general] wxfalsecolor v0.52 released - minor updates
Message-ID: <CAKGV-k2hnaFEiVXx_WSM0eFVanenv-x5S5dhdRUkyG7WFwG2RQ@mail.gmail.com>

All

For the first time in years I have created a new release of wxfalsecolor.
This is mostly a maintenance update to work with GitHub as the new code
repository but a few minor updates are included as well.

Download link:
https://github.com/tbleicher/wxfalsecolor/releases/download/v0.52/wxfalsecolor_v0.52.exe

New Home Page (work in progress):
http://tbleicher.github.io/wxfalsecolor/

New GitHub repository:
https://github.com/tbleicher/wxfalsecolor


This release was necessary because the old Google Code website will be
shutting down soon. As a result older versions will not be able to notify
you about new releases or bug fixes. This update adjusts the auto-update
feature to search for new releases on the GitHub repository page.  Also,
updates are now identified by version number (tag name) and not by release
date.

*Please use this new version to receive future updates and bug fixes!*

A new feature was added to allow the on-the-fly resizing of large HDR files
during loading. This process will create a backup of the original file,
then use *pfilt* to create a small version which is then used for the
analysis. It is supposed to always create a backup but please be careful
and make a copy of your files first. You will find your original image next
to the working copy with a suffix based on the image resolution (i.e. "
*image_3000x2000.hdr*").

The reading of image data has been improved which should also help with
large files. You still need some patience and a lot of memory.

I also have changed the built-system to a 32-bit Windows 7 virtual machine.
If you are still using Windows XP you may see odd popup messages at the
start of the program.

Please report any bugs, issues or feature requests via the GitHub issue
tracker:
https://github.com/tbleicher/wxfalsecolor/issues


Regards, and to all the dads out there: Enjoy Father's Day!

Thomas

	calculation
Message-ID: <CAPysv6D_mcUiAH8xXWcZkEKrnnd+F-5EB4XLmaZZ86i24tx_2A@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,


I have two questions regarding the weighting factors (0.265, 0.670, 0.065)
that are used in the formula ( I = 0.265 IR+ 0.670 IG + 0.065 IB) with
which one can convert the spectral irradiance triad to irradiance. My first
question is: where these weighting factor come from? Do they incorporate
the spectral sensitivity of the human eye (so called V(?)) in the
irradiance calculation? My second question is: should the summation of
these weighting factors be always equal to 1.


Thank you in advance,

Parisa

Hi Parisa,

Yes, these values are the so-called V-lambda or photopic weighting function, and yes these three will always equal 1 (naturally your derived result will generally be > 1).

*Be advised*, your formula as printed in your post is incomplete; when converting irradiance as computed by Radiance (the software) to illuminance, you need to multiply the whole thing by 179 which is the luminous efficacy value to be used _with Radiance_. In other words:

I = 179 * (0.265 IR+ 0.670 IG + 0.065 IB)

There are scores of posts in the archives about this value and how it came to be, and why it works even though it's different from any luminous efficacy value you've ever seen in a textbook on light. =)

Hi Parisa,

in fact these are weighting functions derived from v(lamda). So you 
should use them only when  all your quantities are in photometric units. 
Irradiance "usually" implies the solar spectrum, but in RADIANCE this 
is  used also only considering the visible spectrum (and then using the 
weighting). I'm not sure if a color weighting makes sense when talking 
about radiometric quantities using the solar spectrum. Usually I 
calculate everything in "grey" (r=g=b) when using the radiometric 
quantities, so this problem doesn't occur. Be aware, that you usually 
calculate everything in photometric quantities in RADIANCE, so if you 
want to calculate the solar spectral behavior you have to take care of 
using the related values(solar transmittance for glazing, solar 
reflectance of surfaces and generate sky and sun with radiometric 
quantities). As far as I know only if you use gendaylit with the -O 1 
option, then sky and sun are automatically in radiometric quantities 
(which means your results are in W/m*m solar spectrum).

Hi Rob,

Thank you for your reply! Is the formula incomplete for calculation of the irradiance value or it is missing 179 luminous efficacy value for conversion of irradiance to illuminance? What if we decide to measure the effective irradiance with respect to another curve (for instance C-lambda)? Should the summation of the C-lambda weighting functions be also equal to 1? Is this a rule in Radiance or it can be violated?

Cheers,
Parisa

If I may jump in, here...

Ultimately the 179 lumens/watt conversion derives from the peak defined efficacy of 683 lumens/watt at 555nm and my particular choice of endpoints for the visible spectrum in integrating an equal energy source.  Since the power-to-photopic conversion is very sensitive to the choice of endpoints (for the very reason that viewers are *not* sensitive to those endpoints), I thought to standardize it at some point and end the confusion.  Divide by 179 going from photometric units and multiply by 179 going to and the two factors cancel, problem solved.

That said, the factor is somewhat arbitrary and Radiance does not really care what lighting units it works in.  This is why Jan's trick of substituting solar reflectances and solar radiances works just fine.  If you dig through most of the Radiance code, you will find very few references to wavelength, and in the end you can compute in infrared and ultraviolet and nothing will go wrong, so long as you can get by with 3 channels or don't mind doing multiple runs.

The RGB coefficients for luminance (ignoring the 179 conversion factor) add up to 1.0 again as a convention, but it's a common one for conversion between color spaces.  In this case, we're converting RGB to one channel of CIE XYZ, the Y channel.  The other matrix coefficients can be found in ray/src/cal/cal/xyz_rgb.cal, or ray/src/common/spec_rgb.c if you prefer C code.

If you would tell us your precise application, what you have as input and what you expect as output, it would help us to better answer your question.

Cheers,
-Greg

Hi Jan,

It is true that if these weighting functions are from V-lambda they are to be used only in calculation of photometric quantities. Doing so the summation of the triad irradiance values should be multiplied to 179 efficacy function to give illuminance ( I = 179*(0.265 IR+ 0.670 IG + 0.065 IB)). What I don?t understand is why these weighting functions are used in calculation of radiometric quantities like irradiance ( I = 0.265 IR+ 0.670 IG + 0.065 IB). You said you calculate everything in grey (r=g=b) to avoid this problem. Shall I ask what do you mean by everything? What is the luminous reflectance of the grey you use? Moreover, is it possible to measure the effective irradiance with respect to C-lambda using adjusted weighting functions? Should the summation of the weighting functions be again equal to 1 as they are for V-lambda?

Cheers,
Parisa

Irradiance "usually" implies the solar spectrum, but in RADIANCE this is  used also only considering the visible spectrum (and then using the weighting). I'm not sure if a color weighting makes sense when talking about radiometric quantities using the solar spectrum. Usually I calculate everything in "grey" (r=g=b) when using the radiometric quantities, so this problem doesn't occur. Be aware, that you usually calculate everything in photometric quantities in RADIANCE, so if you want to calculate the solar spectral behavior you have to take care of using the related values(solar transmittance for glazing, solar reflectance of surfaces and generate sky and sun with radiometric quantities). As far as I know only if you use gendaylit with the -O 1 option, then sky and sun are automatically in radiometric quantities (which means your results are in W/m*m solar spectrum).

Thank you all for your reply. I have now tried several variations with your suggestions and although the blotching issue is not resolved, the images do get slightly better. Could the issue in fact be that the diffuse and specular transmissive properties are so low that in reality very little light would pass into the scene, thus causing a very low light condition closely represented by the blotching case we see from the simulations? 

Just to clarify the light transmission of translucent glazing is equal to the sum of the diffuse and specular transmission.... right?

Orn,
With clear glass, a very significant contribution is made by the direct sun, so all the ambient bounces (and their calculation parameters) contribute less to the scene, and you see less blotches.
 
For the translucent glass, try again with all of your first run parameters, but instead of -ar 64 try -ar 500 or -ar 1000. This probably has the biggest impact on visibility of blotches. This is particularly
 important if your model includes a room that?s part of a much larger building, or a full building floor with a very large site context modeled around it.
 
In the parameters you tested in the second run, when you increased ?ad and lowered ?aa those should also improve accuracy, but might not be necessary depending on how much importance you put on accuracy versus
 calculation time.

Hi Greg and Jan,


Thank you for your detailed replies!

Here is my precise application: I want to use Radiance to estimate/simulate
the effective irradiance with respect to the C-lambda.

First option is to use different (-0.034 IR + 0.323 IG + 0.558 IB)
weighting functions for C-lambda as suggested by Geisler-Moroder & Dur
(2010) in their paper (entitled *?**Estimating melatonin suppression and
photosynthesis activity in real-world scenes from computer generated
images?*). My question is whether using these C-lambda weighting functions
is a correct way of getting effective irradiance with respect to C-lambda
in W/m2 or not?

Second option is to use the spectral rendering as suggested by Ruppertsberg
& Bloj (2008) in their paper (entitled *?Creating physically accurate
visual stimuli for free: Spectral rendering with RADIANCE?*) . In this case
my question is how can I spectrally model the sky?

Cheers,

Parisa

This seems like a poster case for the new photon-mapping routines.  If you are working with the latest alpha version, you should definitely give that a try.  The irradiance cache isn't built to handle specular scattering like this.  You would have to turn it off with -aa 0 and put up with the noise.  Using a caustic photon map avoids the issue.  It's even built into the latest rad program, so you just need to set up your maps using:

	PGMAP= scene_g.pmp 200K 50
	PCMAP= scene_c.pmp 1M 50

Rad will run mkpmap and set the rvu or rpict options appropriately, and you can watch what it does.  It typically spits out things like:

	oconv sky.rad window3b.rad office.rad window_port.rad > test3f.oct
	mkpmap -apo window_port -fo+ -apg test3f_g.pmp 200K -apc test3f_c.pmp 1M test3f.oct
	rpict -vu 0 1 0 -vf fish.vf -dp 512 -ar 185 -ms 1.3 -ds .3 -dt .1 -dc .5 -dr 1 -ss 1 -st .1 -ab 1 -af test3f.amb -aa .1 -ad 1536 -as 392 -av 10 10 10 -lr 8 -lw 1e-4 -ap test3f_g.pmp 50 -ap test3f_c.pmp 50 -av 0.8 0.8 0.8 -x 64 -y 64 -ps 1 test3f.oct > /dev/null

	pfilt -1 -e .05 -r .6 -x /2 -y /2 test3f_fish.unf > test3f_fish.hdr

You can dig through these for hints of how to run everything if you prefer doing it by hand.

Did you try setting roughness to zero in your trans definition? That solves
it for me.
Though if the small extra scatter you get from the roughness is important
to your simulation, than Greg has a good point. Photonmap is best.

Hi Parisa,

If you are only comparing one set of C-lambda values to another, then the scaling does not matter.  If, on the other hand, the RGB coefficients from David & Arne's paper were somehow computed to correlate with other aspects of irradiance, such as photopic adaptation, then you probably should use them as given.  I guess I need to read their paper....

A full spectral calculation probably is not needed in this case, but it would help to have a good estimate of the sky color either way.  You should check out Mark Stock's implementation of the Utah sky model using Radiance:

Best,

You need to make sure that your RAYPATH environment variable has "." in it (probably first).

Hi Parisa,

when we worked on the spectral evaluations back then, we were testing our
spectral version of Radiance (which is unfortunately based on Radiance 3.8
and has not been updated since then...). Our idea back then was to check
whether there are RGB coefficients that provide reasonable results for
calculating spectrally weighted values. With the coefficients as given in
the paper you can definitely get an estimation, but there are already
deviations from the correct spectral calculations if you only look at the
light source spectra themselves. This might even get worse if
interreflections significantly contribute to the illumination. This is also
true for illuminances and color, which in fact are nothing else but special
spectral weighting functions (see therefore Greg's paper "Picture Perfect
RGB Rendering Using Spectral Prefiltering and Sharp Color Primaries" at
http://www.anyhere.com/gward/papers/egwr02/index.html or Arne's and mine
"Color-rendering indices in global illumination methods" at
http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/1.3274623)

So, if you really need to be sure about your values (as far as this is
possible within a simulation...), I would always suggest to use spectral
rendering and use the c(lambda) weighting function (as also stated in the
conclusion of the paper). Following the proposal by Ruppertsberg&Bloj you
can just run several 3-channel runs with a recent version of RADIANCE and
put them together to you spectral result.

Best,
David

Hi all,

I was just writing an reply when David sent his mail...
So I just wanna add, that for a full spectral simulation you definitely should add the spectral transmission of the glazing (and also the spectral behaviour of all other materials) and to be sure about the used sun and sky spectrum. In my point of view, the spectral sky model is the largest uncertainty at the moment (besides the general discussion about the c(lambda) itself).
@Mark and Greg: Did the Utah sky model undergo a validation by the use of spectral and luminance data?  I know that currently TU Berlin is acquiring a huge dataset containing such data in order to develop a spectral sky model.

Jan

Hi Greg and Jan,

Thank you for your detailed replies!

Here is my precise application: I want to use Radiance to estimate/simulate the effective irradiance with respect to the C-lambda.

First option is to use different (-0.034 IR + 0.323 IG + 0.558 IB) weighting functions for C-lambda as suggested by Geisler-Moroder & Dur (2010) in their paper (entitled ?Estimating melatonin suppression and photosynthesis activity in real-world scenes from computer generated images?). My question is whether using these C-lambda weighting functions is a correct way of getting effective irradiance with respect to C-lambda in W/m2 or not?

Second option is to use the spectral rendering as suggested by Ruppertsberg & Bloj (2008) in their paper (entitled ?Creating physically accurate visual stimuli for free: Spectral rendering with RADIANCE?) . In this case my question is how can I spectrally model the sky?

Cheers,

Parisa

Subject: [Radiance-general] No diffuse component in rtrace with gendaylit
Message-ID: <CA+U776ApbmkGL5fONg7X40YSAMiyOqAXhK7BbZVUjiiwRgwwrw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am using rtrace to calculate the total solar radiation in a new
development in Dubai. The Radiance version is NREL version 5.0.a.3.
I am struggling because the results of rtrace do not have the diffuse
component. Points in shade have 0 W/m2 total radiation.

I generate the sky with

gendaylit 6 22 10 -W 667.0 255.0 -g 0.0 -O 1 -a 25.25 -o -55.333 -m -55 -i
60 > sky_2010062210.rad

The resulting sky is

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# /usr/local/radiance/bin/gendaylit 6 22 10 -W 667.0 255.0 -g 0.0 -O 1 -a
25.25 -o -55.333 -m -55 -i 60
# Local solar time: 10.00
# Solar altitude and azimuth: 62.6 -92.7

0.459672 0.021278 0.887834
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The geometry is quite simple: one vertical building and a circular area of
interest at 1.5 m from the ground
(
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1342856/Screen%20Shot%202015-06-25%20at%2016.14.39.png
)

The radiance scene also includes the ground. The circular are you see in
the picture is not exported to radiance.

This is the rtrace command I use is

rtrace -h -I -ab 2 -aa 0.15 -ar 128 -ad 512 -as 256 -ds 0.15 -dt 0.05 -w
-oov octree_2010062210.oct < mesh.pts > irradiation_2010062210.dat

The typical line in mesh.pts is something like

26.334568151370174 -2.649873307914385 1.4999999999999996 0.0 0.0 1.0

Using these commands all the points in shade appear not to have any diffuse
radiation. See image

https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1342856/Screen%20Shot%202015-06-25%20at%2016.19.16.png

I am sure I am making a fundamental mistake, but really can't understand
where the problem is.

Thanks
Ruggiero

Ruggiero,
Do you have a definition of the sky dome geometry in your scene? If not, there?s nothing emitting the brightness defined by gendaylit. Something like:

File skysources.rad or similar:
-------------------------------------
skyfunc glow sky_glow
0 0 4    1 1 1 0

sky_glow source sky
0 0 4    0 0 1 180

skyfunc glow ground_glow
0 0 4    1 1 1 0

ground_glow source ground
0 0 4    0 0 -1 180

Hi Don,
values less than 0 doesn t make sense in principal, but are mathematical possible when you look at the equation. (log function)
It means that you consider areas with a very low luminance as a glare source or your background luminance is very high.

I don't know of any spectral sky models that have undergone rigorous validation from measurements.  There is a newer model by Hosek & Wilkie that improves upon some weak points of the Utah sky model published in TOG (2012):

In my point of view, the spectral sky model is the largest uncertainty at the moment (besides the general discussion about the c(lambda) itself).

Our idea back then was to check whether there are RGB coefficients that provide reasonable results for calculating spectrally weighted values. With the coefficients as given in the paper you can definitely get an estimation, but there are already deviations from the correct spectral calculations if you only look at the light source spectra themselves. This might even get worse if interreflections significantly contribute to the illumination. This is also true for illuminances and color, which in fact are nothing else but special spectral weighting functions (see therefore Greg's paper "Picture Perfect RGB Rendering Using Spectral Prefiltering and Sharp Color Primaries" at http://www.anyhere.com/gward/papers/egwr02/index.html or Arne's and mine "Color-rendering indices in global illumination methods" at http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/1.3274623) 
> 
> So, if you really need to be sure about your values (as far as this is possible within a simulation...), I would always suggest to use spectral rendering and use the c(lambda) weighting function (as also stated in the conclusion of the paper). Following the proposal by Ruppertsberg&Bloj you can just run several 3-channel runs with a recent version of RADIANCE and put them together to you spectral result.

If, on the other hand, the RGB coefficients from David & Arne's paper were somehow computed to correlate with other aspects of irradiance, such as photopic adaptation, then you probably should use them as given.  I guess I need to read their paper....

Since the power-to-photopic conversion is very sensitive to the choice of endpoints (for the very reason that viewers are *not* sensitive to those endpoints), I thought to standardize it at some point and end the confusion.

This is why Jan's trick of substituting solar reflectances and solar radiances works just fine.
