Thank you "PAB" and "schorsch" for all your comments!

I've prepared two new packages according to your advices, but
I had to post a query in the debian-devel(-italian) ml about how 
to use /opt with debian packages,
because it seems that no debian packages are allowed to put 
anything into /opt (maybe I'm wrong ...), since add-on packages
are not debian packages ...

There is also a few other conflicts with debian policy:

No csh scripts can be used:
begin---8<---quoting---8<---quoting---8<---quoting---8<---quoting---8<---quoting---
11.4 Scripts
[...]
csh and tcsh should be avoided as scripting languages. See Csh Programming 
Considered Harmful, one of the comp.unix.* FAQs, which can be found at 
http://language.perl.com/versus/csh.whynot.[41] If an upstream package comes 
with csh scripts then you must make sure that they start with #!/bin/csh and 
make your package depend on the c-shell virtual package. 

Any scripts which create files in world-writeable directories (e.g., in /tmp) 
must use a mechanism which will fail if a file with the same name already 
exists. 

The Debian base system provides the tempfile and mktemp utilities for use by 
scripts for this purpose. 
end---8<---quoting---8<---quoting---8<---quoting---8<---quoting---8<---quoting---
 
No environment variables should be used:
begin---8<---quoting---8<---quoting---8<---quoting---8<---quoting---8<---quoting---
10.9 Environment variables
A program must not depend on environment variables to get reasonable defaults. 
(That's because these environment variables would have to be set in a 
system-wide configuration file like /etc/profile, which is not supported by 
all shells.) 

If a program usually depends on environment variables for its configuration, 
the program should be changed to fall back to a reasonable default 
configuration if these environment variables are not present. If this cannot 
be done easily (e.g., if the source code of a non-free program is not 
available), the program must be replaced by a small `wrapper' shell script 
which sets the environment variables if they are not already defined, and 
calls the original program. 

Here is an example of a wrapper script for this purpose: 

     #!/bin/sh
     BAR=${BAR:-/var/lib/fubar}
     export BAR
     exec /usr/lib/foo/foo "$@"

Furthermore, as /etc/profile is a configuration file of the base-files 
package, other packages must not put any environment variables or other 
commands into that file. 
end---8<---quoting---8<---quoting---8<---quoting---8<---quoting---8<---quoting---

I think I'll update the packages when I'll have received an answer ...

I told you about my plan to make also a radiancestatic package and a 
radiancepmap package. Is there anybody interested in having also a
direct cache patched binary package?

Writing this into an OS policy is condescending at best, and
arrogant at worst. If Debian wants to claim posix compliance,
then a csh variant must be present, which means users may use it
for whatever purpose they please. Some people think that [t]csh
doesn't have all the features they would like to have in a
scripting language, and there are good arguments for that. But
claiming that others may not use it for that reason is nonsense.

Fortunately, they were decent enough to use the word "should".
That makes it a recommendation that you're not bound to in any way.

That's a requirement of the package manager, and probably worth
adhering to. Note that Radiance currently also includes scripts
that depend on a specific (and rather old) version of tcl/tk.
I'm not sure if making the package dependent on that would be an
equally good idea, though.

This is certainly good practise, but not critical for Radiance,
and not in your hands as a package builder anyway. Or are they
only talking about scripts that are used while *installing* the
package?


> No environment variables should be used:

Another "should" that is not really up to the OS folks to decide
about. It may still be a good idea for practical reasons, though.
Note that my suggestion for Radiance to search its libraries in
certain locations relative to its binaries would bring us into
compliance with this point as a side effect.


> I think I'll update the packages when I'll have received an answer ...

I'd say ignore the "should"s at will. Nothing a user can do with
your Radiance package will threaten the integrity of their
system, not even on Debian.

Message-ID: <200304041743.03272.anselmo@dream.unipa.it>

My Radiance linux/i386 packages page has been updated:

http://dream.unipa.it/dream/pub/dot/anselmo/radiance/packages/

Here you will find the following versions of Radiance
Radiance 3.5.0
Radiance 3.5.0 static
Radiance 3.4.1 pmap 
(patched with the photon mapping extension by Roland Schregle)

I have decided to prepare 4 kinds of packages: tar.gz, tar.bz2, deb and rpm.

The tar.gz and tar.bz2 packages can be considered add-on packages, so
the suggested installation location is /opt/radiance.

The deb and rpm packages behave this way:

the binaries are installed into -> /usr/lib/radiance/bin
the radiance library is installed into  -> /usr/share/radiance/lib
the examples are installed into -> /usr/share/radiance/obj
the documentation is installed into -> /usr/share/doc/radiance
the man pages are installed into -> /usr/share/man

After the package installation, the user only has to add /usr/lib/radiance/bin
to the PATH environment variable, since I have added /usr/share/radiance/lib
to the default library search path in the source code (src/common/paths.h).

Georg Mischler wrote:

I finally decided to use these locations because making a debian package
means contributing to the debian distribution, that has his own policy that
must be respected. 
I also tried to use the /opt/radiance path, but the debian packaging system 
didn't behave very well in this case, so I followed the advices that came 
from the Debian side. Of course I ignored the "csh scripts
problem" and resolved the "environment variable problem" by adding  
/usr/share/radiance/lib to the default library search path in the source code 
(src/common/paths.h), as I already said.

The rpm packages are derived from the deb ones using alien.

Here are a few notes about the packages (for more info, just check the page):
1) when compiling the "static version" I had some problems with unresolved 
symbols inside libGL.a and libGLU.a coming from the Mesa distribution. I even 
compiled by myself the Mesa libs, but this didn't solved the problem. 
Unfortunately I don't much have time to go deeper, so the static version has 
no OpenGL related stuff.
2) I never managed in compiling the pmap patched code together with
the holodeck files, so the pmap package has no holodeck executables.
If anybody wants to help me, I can share my stderr.

Many thanks to Georg Mischler and to Peter Apian-Bennewitz for their
help and comments.

I hope that these packages can be useful ...

I don't think it's useful (if even possible) to have all OpenGL
components linked statically. After all, the hardware you have
installed decides about which mesa modules need to be loaded.

Hello all,

I have some questions regarding the build system used by radiance. First
of all is there a reason to not use the autoconf tools ? ( i didn't find
any references to this topic so i hope its not a FAQ). Secondly i
noticed sources for X10 and old X11 releases and DOS-VGA stuff, what are
the plans with these pieces ? rewrite to more modern versions ? removing
them all to getter and have separate viewers ?=20

And last, who is doing what , and where is what help needed ? :-)

It's true that there's still some flotsam in the 3.5 distribution -- 
mostly things that don't get built but I haven't looked at the source 
code to decide if it needs to be thrown out or not.  The X11 stuff is 
all up-to-date as far as I know.  The X10 and VGA drivers could easily 
be thrown out, and probably should be at some point.

I have never used autoconf and don't plan to, as I don't see the need 
for it.  There are very few conditional compiles in Radiance, and as we 
have discussed in previous posts, most of the ones that remain can be 
eliminated with a little effort.  I would rather see us spend time on 
that than tailoring compiles based on an autoconf approach, which would 
be tedous and probably less reliable in the end.

I'm not sure the level of integration you are seeking Tou, but if all 
you need is to get an Archicad model into Radiance for 
rendering/analysis, I'd assume you could save your model as a DXF file 
and use dxf2rad to convert it into a Radiance scene description.  If 
you're looking to preserve materials or uv mappings, I'm pretty sure 
there are other methods that will preserve at least some of that, but 
that's out of my depth. HTH.

Dxf2rad works fine with files generated by Archicad.

I think some people have also had success with exporting
to 3DS Max, and converting the result with Conrad, unless
I'm confusing this with something else at the moment.

If Archicad can export Wavefront obj files, then you could
use those directly with Radiance 3.5.

There are also attempts around to export Radiance scene files
immediately from Archicad, but as far as I know, none of that
is ready for public consumption at the moment.
