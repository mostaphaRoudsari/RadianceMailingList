Hi,
additionally to the general posting a few seconds ago: Reflections off 
specular surfaces showing patterns. - my two thoughts:
The visible patterns result from correlation between the sequence used 
in stratifying random numbers and the image width.
Either the stratification's sequence is enhanced (two orders of magn. 
longer ?) or substituted by something without a sequence.
Or (and more likely) the sequence is de-correlated with image width. A 
sequence in one line is ok, a sequence slightly one or two pixels off 
each line is (of course) visible.

The correlation with pixel position is intentional.  Low-discrepancy
sequences necessarily have some correlation, and it is up to the
programmer to decide how this manifests itself.  If you don't choose
something, you are likely to be surprised and disappointed with the
results, as I was initially.  I selected this pattern based on its
"brushed" appearance.  There is a function (pixnumber?) in src/rt/rpict.c
that determines this, and you are welcome to play around with it.

So what we really need would be some 2-dimensional random number
generator producing a less conspicuous screening pattern?
Assuming that such a thing even exists, of course...

Debian sid (unstable) version, gcc-3.3.  I used scads of Pentium-4 
compiler options, but I can't look them up now--the system I was 
testing on is running MS-Windows at the moment.

I noted these problems:

1. There are two places where strcpy() is declared as an external 
function; unfortunately it's a macro in that environment, and one gets 
a confusing compile-time error.  PJ Plauger says that use of macros in 
this way is valid, at least as of C99.  See 
<http://www.dinkumware.com/manuals/reader.aspx?b=c/&h=lib_over.html>.

2. The provided version of libtiff does not compile in that 
environment; the configure script fails.  I suspect a conflict with the 
system's version of "bash," which may have a bug--it is "unstable," 
after all.  The current version of libtiff compiles, but I did not test 
its functionality.  Libtiff is actually available on that platform as 
the Debian package libtiffg3.

3. That version of Linux supports OpenGL, but I had to hack makeall to 
get it built in.

"rholo" sure was fast, though!

Can you tell me where you found these?  I removed all the ones I could 
find, and you could save me some tedious searching if you know where 
they are.

I don't know enough abot libtiff's build process to hack it.  There are 
some problems on Solaris as well.

You can add "ogl" to the SPECIAL= line of rmake -- you don't need to 
hack makeall, really.

Sorry--sure.

1. util/glrad.c--strchr() (I was wrong about the function, too.)  
Probably the #ifdef BSD that covers it with index() could be dropped, 
too, since strchr() is part of C90.

2. hd/rhd_ogl.c--index().  Ironically, the declaration (in 
dev_section()) does not seem to actually be used, but still creates a 
compile-time error.

Anyone who doubts Greg's position on conditional compilation, take note.

My compile-time problems were cleared by downloading the latest release 
(3.5.7) from Debian; I expect the version at www.libtiff.org is the the 
same.  The only thing I had to do to get it to compile was to bring 
over the "configure.local" file from the old version.  I do not, 
however, know that it will actually work, though I think it very 
likely.  Note that LZW compression support is problematic, since that 
algorithm has been patented, though code is linked at libtiff.org.
