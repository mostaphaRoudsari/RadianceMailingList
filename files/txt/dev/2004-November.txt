Varargs is K&R C (pre ANSI). It is still supported by most
compilers (resp. the associated libraries) for backwards
compatibility.  Apparently some gcc packages are starting to
abandon that tradition now, which was to be expected eventually.

If that's the only place where we use varargs.h, then dropping
that driver is a reasonable solution. If it's used elsewhere as
well, then we should fix those places to use the ANSI stdarg
macros instead.  That's one of the remaining items in my
ANSIfication efforts.

Apropos: Can we establish any kind of consensus about which
modules in the current distribution are considered obsolete?
I'm sure there are a few more, and if we remove all of them in
one go, then that might eliminate a few more potential build
hassles. The deleted files will go to the CVS attic, where
people can still get them if anyone should ever need them again.

I don't think varargs.h is used anywhere else -- at least, I've never 
used it.  I took the impress functions from somewhere else.  I don't 
think the printers have existed since 1989 or so, and they weren't even 
all that popular back then.  PostScript took over the printer market 
about that time.

Here's my candidate list of programs for the CVS attic:

oki20	- printer driver for OkiMate 20 printer (B&W)
oki20c	- printer driver for OkiMate 20 color printer
pcwarp	- intended as more general substitute for macbetcal, but never 
quite worked
plotin	- convert old Unix plot(5) files to metafile graphics
ra_avs	- convert to & from AVS image format
ra_bn	- convert to & from Barneyscann format
ra_pr	- convert to & from 8-bit Sun rasterfile format (still used by 
anyone?)
ra_pr24	- convert to & from 24-bit Sun rasterfile format
thf2rad	- convert GDS "things file" to Radiance scene format
ttyimage	- picture to ASCII output converter (useful for anything 
anymore?)

So, not quite as many as I thought.  In fact, I notice that the impress 
driver isn't in my list of built executables -- meaning that it's 
already effectively "off the list" of Radiance programs.  However, it's 
still in the source directories, along with a lot of other flotsam 
that's no longer used for anything.  I wonder now why Francesco was 
even seeing this error, and now I see that my gcc 3.3 compiler does NOT 
support varargs when I try to build the "impress" executable manually.  
Perhaps he was using SCONS, and schorsch included things there that are 
not built by the default Rmakefile.

So, we should add to the list source files that are not built by 
default these days.  Unused headers:

The README files in the corresponding directories explain what some of

have clearly not been compiled for a long, long time.  As far as I'm 
concerned, we can retire them all to the CVS attic.  If it turns out we 
made a mistake on one or two, we can always pull them down again.  
There's no real rush on this, so if anyone has any thoughts or wants to 
speak up for a favorite routine, now's the time.

It was a competitor to PostScript developed by Imagen, back in the
long-long ago.  There are probably still some imPRESS printers out
there operating--there are at least some Linux drivers for them.  I am
hoping they are rare enough that we can stop worrying about imPRESS,
though.

Ttyimage is used in the test suite. It is generally a nice
debugging tool, which I also used when I wrote my image file
parser for Python some time ago.

He obviously tried to build the "special" selection.

SCons has the same "special" targets as the RMakefiles, but
I'd be happy to get rid of them.

This is (or should be?) used on Windows to remove the *.exe
file name extension from executable paths. I'm not sure how
necessary it really is though, because even the SCons build
seems to ignore it at the moment.

Hi!

I've just compiled Radiance with cygwin.
EVERYTHING got compiled (Yup! I only applied the small
fix for varargs.h - again: GREAT WORK! This time I didn't have
any problem with the libtiff either!), but the programs don't get
copied to the specified bin directory.
A quick fix is adding the $(ESUFFIX) variable after the
name of each program in the PROGS declaration of each Rmakefile,
like this:

PROGS = icalc$(ESUFFIX) ev$(ESUFFIX) rcalc$(ESUFFIX) ...

This shouldn't change the rmake behaviour with other platforms, right?

Now it's time for Scons ...

I should make a downloadable cygwin/radiance package soon ...

About the CVS attic, I also like ttyimage, 
and I think that it should be a lot of fun enhancing it
with aalib (!)

http://aa-project.sourceforge.net/index.html
http://aa-project.sourceforge.net/tune/

About the other programs, I've used plotin ...

Hi,

There seems to be a limit to the number of materials that can be listed 
in a file for use with the -aE option. It looks like it is 128 lines. Is 
this fixed? Can it be adjusted at compile time? Can multiple exclude 
files be used?

Hi Jack,

yes, the number of materials in the ambient exclude/include list ist 
currently limited to 128.

if you want to augment it (at compile time) change

1) in rpict.c the declaration char* amblist[128]

2) to be on the safe side
     in ambient.c : augment the #define MAXASET 511

3) also to be on the safe side
    in wordfile.c (src/common) augment the #define MAXFLEN 8192


steps 2 and 3 are probably not necessary, the business is a bit weird 
because the hierachyless input format allows the occurence of several 
material instances with the same name, but different object number 
(that's why the MAXASET (511) is greater than the name list maximum (128))

as usual, I don't give any guarantee if this is enough or right or if 
I've still forgotten something ...and AFAIK you can only specify one 
exclude file, 'cause there's only one list internally which is checked

-cb

PS it's funy, in fact I've already waited for something like this to 
happen, i.e. someone running against this border :-)

Hi Carsten,

Thanks for the follow-up. Is there a way to determine what MAXASET and 
MAXFLEN should be set to relative to amblist[]. For example if I double 
amblist to amblist[256] do I need to double the other values. Also I 
note that amblist occurs in rtrace.c and rview.c. Wouldn't it make sense 
if amblist was defined in one place (eg some header file) so that it 
could be uniformly applied? Also is there some hidden downside to 
increasing these values?

FYI, as to hitting the border. The exclude file that I have is really to 
serve as a default list so that if certain objects (trees, plants) are 
used in the scene then their geometry is excluded from the ambient 
calculation (that is that I do not have to think about it). I was trying 
to add some more and encountered the problem. It is not that I currently 
have more that 128 items that are actually being excluded.

-Jack

PS, I really need to set some time aside to work with radzilla and play 
with all the features you implemented!

Hi Jack

again, the following holds as far as I understood it ..

The matter is this: you can write e.g.

void plastic blue
0
0 ..blablabla

blue sphere b_sphere
0
0
4 ...

void plastic blue
0
0
...

blue polygon b_polygon
0
0
..

then the sphere will be made of the first blue, the polygon out of the 
second. You have only one time the name blue, but two material objects 
which are affected if 'blue' is to be excluded.

Now no one would do this in the way I described it, but think of putting 
together a scene by xforming several inputfiles together. A typical case 
are luminaire description files, usually you have a 'brightdata', a 
brightdata-modified 'light', and then the geometry, say a 'ring' or a 
'polygon'. If you model a 10 times 10 array of these luminaires on a 
ceiling, and xform luminaire.rad a hundred times into your scene, you 
will have 100 instances of the 'brightdata' and the 'light' material 
also, i.e. a hundred 'light' material objects with the same name.

So the amount by which MAXASET needs to be bigger than the name list is 
in fact not determined, but depends upon how often the same material 
name appears in your input files. And the MAXFLEN sets the file size for 
the exclude list, and thus depend a bit on your names (there is another 
limit, a name string can be maximal 128 characters long, so the current 
MAXFLEN allows e.g 64 128-character long words
(who names materials with 128 character words ???) .

In other words, if you specify a material name only once in your scene 
input, you needn't bother about MAXASET and MAXFLEN, only augment the 
amblist length.

Yes, it would be easier if this max. list length could be set by one 
define somewhere. But I guess the topic simply was considered of minor 
importance, as in 99.99% of all cases maybe one or two materials are 
excluded. The weird thing about all this is that this minor detail 
causes some headache on the programming side... :-)


The downside from a longer list is probably negligible. You have to 
search a longer list on input. The number of name occurences in the 
input files determine the list which is checked during rendering, so if 
you 'pro forma' exclude a material which doesn't appear in your scene 
anyway, you won't notice it at all.

Hi Carsten,

Sorry to be dense-headed here.

   1. amblist[128] - is this the number of names possible in the list?
   2. MAXASET - the comments indicate this is the maximum number of
      elements in the ambient set, what does this mean? Is a scene
      limited to 511 names of materials assigned directly to geometry?
   3. MAXFLEN - Does the type of compile make a difference? I have a new
      opeteron system which I am compiling with -m64? I must admit I am
      a bit confused about the 64 v 32 bit stuff (all I really care
      about is performance!) The exclude file is well under 8K in size.

So the question still remains (mostly because I still getting my head 
around it), if I want to increase the number of names that can be 
included in the exclude list, what do I need to change?

I believe that I can add the following to the rmake file:

    -DMAXASET=a_new_value -DMAXFLEN=b_new_value

I have done this for -DMAXOBJBLK=131071 at compile, so I assume this 
would work for the others

Can I do something similar to set amblist[] at compile rather than 
editing the files?

Thanks for all your help.

Hi Carsten,

Poking around a bit more, I see that there is:

#define AMBLLEN 128 /* max. ambient list length */

in ray.h

This looks like it might be closer to what I need?

This is used to set the length of amblist in raycalls.c, why not in the 
other locations where amblist is used?

Hi Jack,

First, thanks to Carsten for fielding Jack's questions -- I learned a 
bit about my own code from your exchange.  For one, I didn't realize 
that I hadn't used the AMBLLEN macro I defined in rt/ray.h everywhere I 
should have.  I just increased this value from 128 to 512, allowing for 
override at compile time.  (Before, there wasn't an enclosing #ifdef 
around it.)  I did the same for the MAXFLEN macro.  Before, it wouldn't 
work to add -DMAXFLEN=?? to the compile script.  Now, it will.  I also 
doubled the value from 8192 to 16384 for MAXFLEN.  These changes will 
appear in tonight's HEAD, or can be downloaded individually through the 
CVS interface.

Oh -- just got your e-mail about AMBLLEN not being used consistently.  
Bingo.

I also increased the maximum number of excluded/included modifiers 
(MAXASET) to 2047.  This may not be enough if you have some object 
you've transformed all over the place as Carsten described, so you may 
also want to override this in your compile, which I've enabled as well. 
  An argument against making this too large is that the method for 
determining whether to exclude a surface or not from the 
interreflection calculation involves a binary search of this list.  In 
other words, you pay a penalty for having a list that increases as the 
log(N), where N is the number of included/excluded surfaces.  Since you 
pay this penalty every time you need an ambient value, you can in 
effect spend more time searching the list than you do computing 
interreflections.  I don't know when this crossover occurs, but I 
imagine it would be a very large number for N.

-Greg

Hi Greg,

Thanks for the additional input and again also to Carsten to getting the 
conversation to this point! So just to confirm it looks like if I grab 
the following from CVS I will be ok:

    * rtrace.c
    * rview.c
    * ambient.c
    * ray.h
    * rpict.c

Correct?

Hi Jack,

You should also pick up wordfile.c from the common directory, and that 
should be it.

I meant the number of included/excluded MODIFIERS, not surfaces.  An 
important distinction for most scenes....

Hi Marija,

This came up in July on the general list, and no one seemed to have a  
proper answer...

	http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004-July/ 
001939.html

The window size is determined by the X11 window manager.  Some window  
managers have preferences you can set for specific X11 clients, but I  
don't know where they live.  Do you know what window manager you are  
using?  (Hint: they are generally platform-specific, so if you tell us  
what machine/OS you are using, this would help.)  Can anyone on the  
list offer suggestions?

likely the original question was asking for something like

    rvu -geometry 100x600-0-0 -vf abc.vf -ab 2 .....

"man 7 X" says:

GEOMETRY SPECIFICATIONS
       One of the advantages of using window systems instead of 
hardwired terminals is that applications don't have to be restricted to 
a particular
       size  or  location  on  the screen.  Although the layout of 
windows on a display is controlled by the window manager that the user 
is running
       (described below), most X programs accept a command line argument 
of the form -geometry WIDTHxHEIGHT+XOFF+YOFF (where  WIDTH,  HEIGHT,  XOFF,
       and YOFF are numbers) for specifying a preferred size and 
location for this application's main window.

whereas rvu says:

merkur $ rvu -geometry 800x600 -vf close.vf baugruppen.oct
rvu: fatal - command line error at '-geometry'

now, this topic evolves faster than I can download mails via DSL....

The X client can deny being resized/repositioned by a window manager.

        attri.override_redirect=True;           /* keep uwm silent */
        attri.backing_store=Always;             /* offscreen saved pixels */
        attri.event_mask=ButtonPressMask;
        
XChangeWindowAttributes(display,WID,CWEventMask|CWOverrideRedirect|CWBackingStore,&attri);

that piece of C is somewhat dated, but the  override_redirect  flag 
still lives in recent X, I bet. However, I might not be very up-to-date 
with my bare-metal X hacking.

Anyway- the main idea would be that the X client (rvu) has _some_ wish 
how large and where it wants to be. That much the client may specify and 
maybe (like) even enforce by the attributes, thereby ignoring any window 
manager.
At last, the window manager is just another X-client in the world of X, 
- no super natural powers assigned to it.

PS: at least these bits belong on the dev list, mea culpa to those not 
used to an X-programming overdose...

(removes foot)  Hey, I *did* say in that same email that I was bowing 
out of the convo, as I already figured I was in over my head...

I guess you could say: */I'm no Radiance expert, but I sometimes play 
one on this list./* (Well, actually, over on radiance-general.)

Thanks for the clarification(s).

Rob, - sorry for that. You could have expected a friendlier sounding bit 
of response from me there, given your sound contributions to the mailing 
list in the past.
