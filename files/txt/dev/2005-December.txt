Subject: [Radiance-dev] parsing rad scenes and small typo in rad2mgf
Message-ID: <29935.1135756026@www46.gmx.net>

Hi,

I am currently searching for a way to parse rad scenes. I found trans.h (and
the readme in translators), and as an example rad2mgf. Is there anything
like a generic parser (there is something like that for mgf, with functions
that have just to be overwritten)? OT: Is there a parser class in Radzilla?

And than I found some message about rat2mgf in rad2mgf.c... maybe one of the
cvs-writers can correct it ;-)

Best wishes for the new year! Lars

Hi Lars,

Radiance scene files were really meant to be read with scanf() and  
written with printf().  If you want help with the loading of  
arguments, I suggest using the routine in src/common/readfargs.c, and  
fgetword() and fputword() for the modifiers and identifiers.

I hope this helps!
-Greg

P.S.  Your letter prompted me to fix not only the misspelling in  
rad2mgf, but also the reading and writing of id's with spaces in  
them, which are discouraged even though they're allowed in Ratiance.

Hi, just found "rat2mgf" in line 221 of rad2mgf.c. Maybe someone with 
cvs-write can fix it ;-) Lars.
