Hi,

I've just subscribed to the list, and at my office we're preparing to 
work on an application based on Radiance.

I haven't seen any traffic come through the list, so I suppose it's very 
quiet at the moment?

Our project may or may not require some Radiance source code tweaking. 
Can such tweaks be committed back to the main source, if they are 
acceptable?

Thanks,

Chris

Currently three folks have write permission to the CVS, with Greg Ward 
taking the lead (as usual).
By my experiences, feedback is welcomed. It is more likely to happen if 
changes are of general use, special short cuts would be somewhat 
cumbersome to maintain. Many special and weird uses are possible with 
nifty scripts and cmdline tools like /rtrace/ without writing C code.

cheers

Is there read-only anonymous access to CVS, for those who want to keep 
up with development?

thought so - that's why I had added an explicit note about it on the 
download page yesterday :-)
Admittingly, CVS direct access is fairly industry standard. On the other 
hand, it's one open port more.
Since changes are not very frequent, maybe one per two weeks on average, 
I'm not (yet) convinced that anynomous CVS read is worth the worry here.

Move it on to SourceForge, join the rest of the open source party :) 
That way you'd have bug trackers, etc. all done for you.

Yes, one big free lunch...
Doesn't solve the problem that there's no /need/ for CVS access, does it 
?  I don't see/feel a large common dominator between the Radiance users 
and computer guys used to anon CVS. Not unless Radiance swims the 
mainstream of CG and given today's abstraction level of the rendering 
core (or the absence of it) I'd be surprised if that happens soon.
Frankly I guess that the config caters for Radiance so far. There 
weren't any requests for features (except Wiki, at the LBNL workshop by 
some, see next line) and less requests for things that would be too 
cumbersome to set up. Open for suggestions.
That's not to say I don't have some ideas what to set up next.

One could argue that there's no need for CVS because there are
so few developers. And there are so few developers because there's
no CVS access...

There may not be a common denominator at the moment, but might that
only be because we're missing out on a large audience who are:

a) mainly interested in projects that have a community-based approach, 
instead of top-down;

b) those who need a simple installer & extensive doco; or 

c) those who require a modular rendering engine that uses CG industry-
standard inputs & outputs?


As I see it:

1) If we want radiance to become _really_ popular, then it could do with
Several improvements, like making it much simpler to install, increased 
flexibility, exporters, or baking.

2) These kind of requirements need multiple core developers.

3) I would like to contribute to radiance, but am put off by the
rather exclusive stance the project has over source contribution.


That said, I've found that all the radiance people I've spoken to have
been a fantastic bunch - extremely cheerful, helpful, straight-forward, 
and a pleasure to deal with. :D  I don't want to put any of your efforts
down; it's just that I want to contribute!  :P

*laff*   Well - you certainly can't argue the opposite.  :P

I'd really love to see some decent documentation on developing
with radiance. A wiki would be a fantastic step forward. A central
bug, request, & code repository would be ideal.

What are you intending to set up next? :)

/historic flash-back on/
reflecting for a second on some reasons why Radiance is in the shape it 
is now:
Radiance has been push forward almost single handedly by Greg Ward, 
becoming the "keeper of the code" and setting the bar for inserting new 
ideas. The positive (IMHO) side is that the core is relative trustworthy 
calculating the right values. However, except for its first couple of 
months and recently with merging versions for 3R5, there has never been 
explicit funding for development or maintaining. Which is a reason not 
to accept (and understand, and maintain, and bug fix) code from others 
(Greg- correct me if I'm wrong).
/historic flash-back off/

There's at least one sad example of extra code which illustrates the 
problem: Roland's photon map had been development as Phd project paid by 
a research grant. So far, so good. The grant money is used up, Roland 
headed off to somewhere else, the research org doesn't seem interested 
in maintaining it and the code is left stranded. Maintaining someone 
else's code is ugly and so far I haven't heard of anyone saying he/she 
ported and checked the photon map for 3R6. Not to mention bug fixes or 
features.

I hope that I'm not devaluating other contributions and good will, but 
the problem seems not so much contributing code, but nursing this 
contribution over the years.
This does work with other PD projects very well. Take Apache for 
example, whose security and stability requirements match those of 
Radiance's requirements of well validated light calculations easily. My 
personal theory is depressingly capitalistic: More market, more money, 
more money to pay people for development. Programmers have to buy food 
and if they are not paid for PD maintenance, they have to do other 
things. Even with personal motivation being high. And more so after 
leaving university. Maybe I'm suffering from what the French call 
/deformation professionell/ ; the world might be better and and it would 
work out without anyone paid at least half time to do the nasty bits 
(likely putting Radiance thru validation scenarios). I can't say for 
sure. However, I do think that a missing CVS access is the least part of 
the problem. Sure its /technically/ the fastest part to solve.

Well, I sure know that feeling. I always thought that a print in 
function files would be nice for quick debugging. That patch, besides 
others, never made it into the source. Still I think a slick core is 
good. That may be the same attitude as the "Life of Brian" guy in the 
Roman dungeon who admired the Romans as "terrific race, the Romans"....

absolutely.
Do you know about Carsten Bauer's radzilla project ? There's a mailing 
list (http://www.radiance-online.org/mailman/listinfo/radzilla)  which 
is not much announced publicly (that could be fixed) and run by Carsten. 
Carsten rewrote large parts of Radiance and that may serve as an 
alternative seed.

 From the results of the feedback form, at least 16 folks are willing to 
write doc and examples. Excellent. A WikiWiki try in Feb 2004 stalled as 
I found it incomprehensible. Next on the list is MoinMoin and that might 
be installed as spin-off when I deal with the Wiki question on another 
project in paid time (sic) around Feb 2005.

Radiance's future depends on folks wanting to contribute, help and work 
on it. Let's see what can be done to give folks a platform to work on.

This seems to be a perennial topic for this list.  I recommend that you  
review the discussion from Dec. 2003 on this list under the thread "Quo  
Vadis Radiance" -- most of these points have been hashed through there.

Anyone who likes can download the changes the moment they are checked  
in via Peter's wonderful HTML-based CVS source code access at  
<http://www.radiance-online.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/ray/>.  It will  
deliver diff's, change comments, anything you like.  I use it all the  
time, as it's a much easier interface than CVS and you don't have to  
deal with commands and remnant files where they don't belong.  Any  
serious changes or additions are marked in the  
ray/doc/notes/ReleaseNotes file, which may be accessed via:

	http://www.radiance-online.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/ray/doc/notes/ 
ReleaseNotes

The HEAD release contains yesterday's changes in one bundle.  There is  
generally no need to keep up with the release on a daily or even a  
weekly basis, because the code simply doesn't change that quickly.  I  
personally prefer it that way, as many developers and many code changes  
would likely lead to more bugs, need to track them, etc., etc.  I don't  
have time for that, myself.  If the majority of folks want it, then the  
code is OpenSource and I could not and would not stop you from taking  
that path.  Unfortunately, I wouldn't be able to follow you on it.

One possibility is to put Radzilla on such a program, but we need to  
involve Carsten in that discussion.  Since Radzilla is specifically  
addressing more the artist than the engineer, reliability is  
deemphasized in favor of coolness, and he has already made numerous  
changes in this direction.  Perhaps Carsten would like some help?

Name a piece of simulation software that was developed by a community.   
I'm not saying there isn't one, but it seems unlikely given the small  
target audience and simulation's critical nature.

> b) those who need a simple installer & extensive doco; or

Schorsch has been working on a better installer based on SCONS.  Have  
you tried it?  Regarding developer documentation, there is a chapter on  
the website, though it's a bit out of date:

	http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/srctree.pdf

> c) those who require a modular rendering engine that uses CG industry-
> standard inputs & outputs?

This is useless for lighting design, as none of the CG industry  
standards handles photometric data.  If you're talking about a new  
market for Radiance, again I would say that a different direction is  
indicated.  Simulation and art serve very different purposes.

What's the point?  There are already 100's of rendering tools out there  
that are better suited to popular tastes.  Why try to make Radiance  
into something it's not?  It currently occupies a unique niche, and  
there are people who depend on it.  (Me, for one.)  If you turn it into  
a RenderMan look-alike, you will lose everything that makes it special,  
and leave those who rely on it at a standstill.

> 2) These kind of requirements need multiple core developers.

No argument there.  A revenue stream would be nice as well.   
(OpenSource has a poor track record in that area.)

There are reasons for being exclusive, the main one being reliability  
of the simulations.  Again, I refer you to last year's thread.  If you  
have a tool you want to add to the system, CVS access is hardly  
required.  You can ship your contribution to me or Schorsch and we'll  
be happy to check it in.  All we need is the C source and a man page.   
If you want to modify existing source, that's where reliability becomes  
a concern.  Is this what you have in mind?

> I'd really love to see some decent documentation on developing

Documentation is great, but who's going to write it?  Rendering with  
Radiance has a lot of stuff on the algorithms and how they're coded,  
and that's always the first place to look.  If you're after information  
on how to develop with Radiance, then I'm probably the one to ask.  I'm  
always happy to answer questions, and offer tips if you have something  
in mind.  Offhand, I have no idea what a developer's guide would look  
like for Radiance, other than the source tree document above.

As for a feature request and bug reporting system, I think it's a great  
idea.  I fix bugs just as soon as I hear about them, which usually  
happens through the dev or general mailing list these days, or from  
people who write to me directly.  It would be nice to have a central  
place for reporting and feature requests, though the latter might not  
get the attention they deserve.  I'm not sure how a wiki would work --  
until your mention of it, I didn't even know the term.

Shuttup, you!

Being the CVS host and owner, there's no reason you couldn't put this 
in, now.  I guess I was never sure quite how it would work, given that 
a ray can spawn many others, resulting in a bit of a jumble on output.  
Did you ever try the debugcal script?  This is what I have used in the 
past to pick rays and test function file output.  Unfortunately, 
there's no man page for it, but you essentially give it an octree and 
some rcalc options (-f function.cal for example), and it takes ray 
origins and directions on the input (as produced by ximage) and 
produces results from your rcalc options.  It doesn't handle every 
possible case, I guess, but it's a 99% solution.

That proofs the point: Adding it would have deluded the code. For /me/ 
it was helpful, for others its confusing. There is a standard way, so 
why add it. Now hang me up the wrong way again.
The bit about the missing man page is slightly irritating, of course. At 
least from the point of rhetoric elegance ...

Mysteriously, there's now a html page 
http://www.radiance-online.org/software/contribute-howto.html .

Hey guys, if you're still with us, don't let this stop you from writing 
code. Roll up the sleeves and dig right in.

Years ago, I heard a nice sentence on AFN Radio:
Life is like a baggage belt at the airport, everything comes round 
again, just a little bit more bumped up..

Hi all,

coming late I'll try to write something without once more repeating 
stuff. Concerning the CVS write access question, my own experience from 
messing with the code makes me definitely argue in favour of Greg and 
Peter. And, well, isn't it quite normal in every more or less complex 
project (regardless if software or hardware or whatever..) that only a 
selected few poeple are in control of the vital parts?

Behind those technical aspects, the (- one of the -) key point(s) is 
probably the following: Radiance is used worldwide for a lot of 
different tasks, including those it wasn't originally written for. The 
code is freely available, and there are lots of programmers out there, 
too. So lets put 1 and 1 together, its natural that there arises an 
enthusiasm for adding features, changing stuff, etc.
It's natural, too, that mostly this reflects special preferences which 
have not to be identical (mostly they aren't :-) ) with the original 
intention of Radiance.

As the point was mentioned (and secondly, because most of the external 
ideas probably belong to the visualization branch) I can imagine 
Radzilla becoming an 'alternative seed', a freak platform for
integration of features. One should definitely wait a bit, however.
The current 0.8 doesn't suit for it, but I've once more rearranged 
things, threwn out the massive code duplications etc, etc and the 
upcoming 1.0 release will have at least some sort of internal structure, 
which might make it easier for others to integrate stuff. So let's 
postpone this until I'm finished with the current revision (most 
probably in some weeks..)
I see it rather relaxed anyway, the chances that in some months hundreds
of people will ring me up, offering fully worked out code for 
integration, are quite low .. :-). Nevertheless things sometimes *might* 
go on quicker if more than just one guy is working on it :-)
-lets wait and see..

Concerning the documentation issue:
a 'problem' might be that there is already lots and lots of it 
available, but many of it is very sophisticated and probably hard to 
understand for non scientist users.
So the usual cry for 'more docs, more docs' might translate into 'easier 
docs, easier docs'. I think it's a common aspect of life, that sometimes 
an outsider who has overcome lots of misunderstandings might have a 
better feeling of explaining things to a newbie than the real masters, 
for whom everything is evident and who directly speak in abstract terms. 
So some central structure for collecting tips, tutorials, FAQs etc from 
a users point of view will be really nice to have, and save the gurus 
the time of answering the same type of question again and again on the 
mailing list.
BTW, there's that new exchange site from Francesco, 
http://www.bozzograo.net/radiance/, which already offers increased 
possibility of participation, (like upload of files and pics etc), so in 
fact some means are already present, they depend of course on all others 
to use them :-).

PS

@Peter: MoinMoin ??? Jau, min Jung, keek mol on, wohnste nech mehr in 
Freiburch? kann man mit di jetzt moins opm Fischmaakt snaken?

PS 2
@Peter again
you've mentioned the photon map, this is really a sad example. One 
problem is, that the code has a completely different flavour. Whilst 
having gained a quite comprehensive understanding of Radiance I still 
have just a rough overview of the pm code. The other is that photon maps 
are newer, more experimental, more demanding in terms of machine 
ressources (esp memory), so with the photon map now you have the 
problems like perhaps with classic Raytracing 20 years ago, on normal 
PCs you soon run against some limits and that disappoints the users who 
are in the meantime accustomed to normal raytracing pics being produced 
quickly without problems. Although I'm fond of it, I also have the 
assumption that the current pm implementation needs some improvement, 
but, yes, who should do it?
Additionally, situations which demand for a photon map approach appear 
far less often than 'normal' applications for Radiance, which naturally 
results in neglection of this feature from the majority.
On the other hand, the mentioned difficulties (different approach, 
different code) are at the same time interesting, too, in that they show 
how much can be done in integrating comprehensive new features into 
Radiance without compromising the original function as long as pm is not 
switched on.

Two thumps up for a documentation arena. As said, a Wiki had been on my 
wish list last year.
I can't get to radsite from my provider or from ISE, - site down or some 
network node down elsewhere ?

Hi Peter,

Yeah, radsite seems to be down at the moment.  I think Danny (Fuller) 
is working on it.  I'm not sure if it's linked to or served by 
render10, but that machine blew it's power supply on Thursday, Danny 
says.

More on documentation.  It seems to me that it would be nice for new 
users to have a place to help them get started, something like a web 
page where they could click a few checkboxes like the ones on your 
survey, identifying themselves as a student, a lighting designer, and 
architect, a researcher, etc., then saying what kind of machine they 
have or other details about their set-up before being directed to a 
page where they could get their newbie questions answered.

Sounds like a bit of work, but hear me out.  On another page, we would 
encourage experienced users to write about what helped them the most 
getting started with Radiance.  They would answer the same survey 
questions above, only at the end of it they would be directed to a page 
with questions asked by the newbies, and be permitted to edit or fill 
in the answers.  Sort of a self-constructing FAQ with personalization 
built in.  There would also be areas for essays on topics of general 
interest, such as "How I Got Started with Radiance" and "Some Bonehead 
Mistakes to Avoid" and "Radiance Made No Sense To Me Until I (fill in 
the blank)".

The trouble with a general FAQ for Radiance is that there are too many 
aspects to it, too many different types of users, and too many answers 
that will only serve to confuse people if they haven't been properly 
primed.  On the plus side, we have some amazing users who are good 
writers and storytellers and are a generally helpful sort.  I'm sure if 
we built it, they would come.

Message-ID: <41EBAB91.1090001@familyhealth.com.au>

Hi everyone,

Since I'm fairly new to Radiance, I thought I'd see if people think that 
this is a good way of generating solar paths in outdoor renderings.

* for each hour of a certain day on each month

	* run gensky with month, day, hour, lat, long and grep the
	  output for the alt and az of the sun's position

	* write a .cal file that pcomb can use.  this cal file will
	  convert the alt/az of the sun into an x/y position and
	  draw a red dot, say at that position.

* end for

That seems like it may be slow, but if .cal files can have arrays, i 
could probably plot all sun positions in one pass.

Does that sound like a reasonable plan?

Thanks,

Chris

if you need just the solar bracelet make it a colored cylinder and tilt it
according to the latitude...
you can both draw it in some CAD system and use it as it is (instancing it,
it could be split into colours according to months) or generate it on the
fly by means of a parametric pattern on the skydome.
If you need to see sun positions (with equation of time) you can just keep
adding sky definition without the glowing dome to the same file, then
visualize the all thing together, being also able to get annual exposure to
other data... (remember -ps 1, look 0 0 1 facing 0 1 0, -vth ... and wait
;-)) )
all these things are really quick to be done...
cheers,
giulio

Ok, so you are saying that the sky file that gensky produces has a 
specular sun in it that you can actuall see if you render looking at it? 
    I assumed that didn't happen :)

There doesn't seem to be a way of turning off the actual sky in gensky, 
and leaving the sun...  We could just generate the parts of the gensky 
output we need using a script and just use that?

Many thanks,

Chris

Hi!

Maybe that means that we should start something simple, like the good 
old how-to's. This is more application-specific, and can be done by 
each of us, as it depends on experience and not so much on general 
knowledge. E.g. if I write a how-to on using Radiance on my Mac with my 
Mac software, it is easy for me as I know all the steps in the process 
from everyday life. And I think for most users this is the beginning - 
they want to solve a specific problem (make a rendering from an AutoCAD 
model, map a picture onto a poylgon etc). Something close to the 
tutorlia examples, but more real-life (the tutorials cover modeling 
with the Radiance scene description language, not with the steps to get 
from CAD to a rendering).

CU Lars.

ok, again here.
gensky generates sun and sky luminance distribution.
this luminance distribution (usually labelled as skyfunc) need to be
attached to a sky dome that the user has to define.
if you do not define any dome the sky will have only one sun and not glowing
dome.
just try 
gensky 12 12 12 +s
and 
oconv
and 
rview
and 
-ps 1
everything is black, a part the sun dot.

If you run a script that keep adding these skies to a unique file, you will
end up with the whole annual sun positions (that you need) and sky luminance
descriptions (that you do not need).

if you do not define any dome and render this image you will see the full
sun curve on a black background, being able to overlay it later to the full
rendered views (same views...).

it's a crude way but it works....

let me know,

Ok, so you are saying that the sky file that gensky produces has a 
specular sun in it that you can actuall see if you render looking at it? 
    I assumed that didn't happen :)

There doesn't seem to be a way of turning off the actual sky in gensky, 
and leaving the sun...  We could just generate the parts of the gensky 
output we need using a script and just use that?

Many thanks,

Chris

Hi!

I've just uploaded here:

http://www.bozzograo.net/radiance/modules.php?op=modload&name=Downloads&file
=index&req=viewsdownload&sid=1

a Python/Makefile thing to generate sunpaths with Radiance.

I should have a better version at home, so I'll probably update
the link soon, but it should give the idea ...

The computed pictures can be mapped to the sky once again with
fisheye.cal ...

This is what Wikis are all about.  Have a look at the newly-created Mac OS
X Server FAQ: http://www.macos-x-server.com/wiki/Main_Page

The admin created the FAQ, but anyone can click the edit link on each
topic and flesh out the answers to the FAQs, and add more.  It's a good
example of a "new" Wiki, one that is just starting to evolve.

There would also be areas for essays on topics of general

This is an excellent idea.  This is something I've always wanted to do on
my own site, but *still* haven't gotten around to doing.  Since I'm
proposing to make a similar presentation at the Montreal Workshop this
summer, I can pretty much guarantee that I would have some content for
this section in the future, and would love to contribute more.  I vividly
recall my staggered start(s) with Radiance, and know loads of people who
were simply scared off by the unix/shell/no-gui aspects of Radiance and
never gave it a fair shake.  Something like you propose just may help a
few more people along before giving up and using AGI or Lumen Micro (I'm
thinking of the architectural lighting design community first and
foremost, since that's the aspect I deal with).

I have no problems with setting up a wiki, my only concern is that if it 
isn't hosted with the radiance site it won't achieve official status. 
If you think otherwise, let me know & I'll go ahead & start setting
up the wiki.

I suggest MediaWiki:

www.mediawiki.org

It runs wikipedia.org, looks good by default and is the best Wiki I've 
dealt with...

I've already mentioned it a few times over the years...
  http://lightingwiki.com/

I originally started this for general lighting related discussions,
but it has been dormant for most of the time. Apparently there
was no wide demand for such a forum. But if people want to start
collecting material for a more accessible documentation of
Radiance, the tool is there and available. Just start writing.

The result can stay there, or if the preference is that it
must be located under radiance-online.org (and Peter finds the
time to setup another installation there), it's easy to migrate
stuff later.

The only thing that I'd have to do myself woult be to create a
"RadianceDocumentation" link on the front page, because that's
one of the few pages that can't be edited by the general public.
Other than that, anyone is invited to just start writing!

Wow, Axel.  I hadn't seen these tutorials before.  They're amazing!  
With your permission, I'd like to add them to the list of documents on 
radsite, which is unfortunately down at the moment.  This also 
dovetails with a discussion we've been having on the dev list about 
providing an interactive repository (or Wiki) for Radiance user 
documentation.  I know a lot of people don't subscribe to that list, so 
I'll summarize:

It started as a rehash of why Radiance authorship is restricted, and if 
there were any decent guidelines for code modifications, which is how 
it got on the dev list.  Then, people started suggesting things about 
how to set up documentation for the software, and it eventually came 
back to some kind of FAQ service for beginners.  The general feeling is 
that a lot of people who might otherwise be interested in Radiance are 
put off by the command-line structure, the scattered documentation, and 
the lack of any clear place to begin (aside from the book of course).  
After all, not everyone wants to order a book and wait for it to be 
shipped to their door just to decide whether or not it's worth the 
effort to learn something.

The current line of reasoning is to provide a forum where more 
experienced users could answer beginner's questions and have their 
answers continually available and editable.  There would also be a 
place for people to write essays on how they got started with Radiance, 
things to avoid, and things to pay attention to.  How-to manuals and 
tutorials such as Axel's would be a perfect jumping off point for a lot 
of newbies, I would think.  The current set of tutorials on radsite are 
getting a little "long in the tooth" so to speak, even if they still 
have a lot of useful information.

I think we're going back and forth right now trying to come up with the 
best way to set this up.  Some people have already set up their own 
resource centers, and we could either link to them or take some of 
their content into our own organization.  (See Georg Mischler's 
Lighting Wiki example at <http://lightingwiki.com/> as an example of 
what's already out there.)  Probably the best way to start is to write 
to me if you have some materials to offer, and I'll talk with Peter A-B 
about setting something up at radiance-online.

Thanks,
-Greg

gee, mates. I'm smashed by the wave of energy and power to write 
tutorials, examples and doc.

So far I've quickly looked at 
http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?OtherWikis , and had a 15 minute 
browse thru http://moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de/  
<http://moin.sourceforge.net/>. I'm not so much fixed on Moin as it is 
the north German equivalent to /G'day/ or /Whats'up/ , but I found that 
my favorite no-nonsense mail agent Exim uses it for their site 
http://www.exim.org/eximwiki/ . And it's written in a reasonable 
language (Python or PHP much preferred over Perl).

I'm on a fairly tight schedule to get a project finished until end of 
January. So, if you guys can hold on, chances are good that it works 
productive on radiance-online in early Feb 2005. Backup etc. implemented 
as usual (thanks to Fraunhofer ISE IT dep). I know it's available as a 
Debian package, I know installing *looks* easy, but I'd better not open 
this can until then.

I've just setup a mediawiki at http://www.radiance-wiki.org. 

I'm going to start adding content to that (come tomorrow :P) - 
we can either continue with that or transfer the content to your 
wiki up once it's up and running.

Start your engines folks & get writing!

Hi folks,

I've took the time and thought about the Wiki idea with a cup of coffee 
in bed this morning. If you're interested (hey, _your_ the ones with a 
degree in IT). It is more social than technical so. But then, some of 
you are in Berkeley. Home of the revolt on Telegraph....

Wiki main idea is to allow anyone to write anything. In its pure form 
without any access restrictions. Now that's freedom of speech. Good. Or 
chatter with low S/N ratio. Bad. On average, I don't believe that a 
compact and reliable guide manifests itself out of thin air without 
anyone being responsible. Not without sorting more important parts from 
less important ones, and care taking. Self organization does happen in 
nature, but it seems to either take a very long time (evolution leading 
e.g. to cats) or to be not energy efficient (laser).
Success of collaboration depends on people. Obvious. However, when I 
think what I like to see on radiance-online, it is something that is 
more structured than the 100% open Wiki starting config. Something like 
a book, with chapters, authors, sections, subsections. And remarks by 
readers on the edges. Wikis can technically do hierarchical structure, 
but at least the split between 'readers' with remarks and  'authors' 
doing the damn writing is not a Wiki spirit. If radiance-online sees a 
collaborative platform, it'll be more a collaborative book in my view, 
and I would for haven's sake not call it a /wiki/.

Compiling contents takes a lot of time, as anyone experienced writing 
his/her thesis (or a chapter in abook). As author investing this time to 
explain a point carefully in a compact way, I'd be not very comfortable 
with the idea that anyone has the same technical editing rights on the 
text after thinking about the problem for 5 seconds from scratch. Maybe 
the other is right and brilliant, maybe he/she is dumb&proud-of-it. In 
the first case he/she should be passed the authorship to, or the remark 
be woven into the text (incl. reference). In the second case he/she may 
scribble along the paper edge.

Apart from the technical bits like

    * how to you get formulas printed nicely (LaTex is still good at this)
    * conversion quality to PDF so a chapter can be printed and read at
      the beach
    * reshuffling of the structure (chapter 2.3.4 now moved to 3.1.1
      where it fits much better), including update of links
    * back-up and mirroring
    * potential conversion to other systems, and what to we do with all
      the work in 5 years from now (how abstract is the internal storage
      format ?)

As author I'd like to have those questions sorted out before I invest 
time to compile substance.

so far, so hoopy
-Peter

Hi Peter,

I missed out on the Telegraph Ave. Revolution.  When was that?
Gee, no one invites me to these things....

I tend to agree that Wiki is probably not the best route to a new 
textbook on Radiance.  I was thinking of something less formal,
like a front page created by the site administrator (you or me) to
point to a number of Wiki pages with user-provided links to PDF
papers, tutorials, and other online material.  Just to give you a flavor,
we could create links for:

o  Daylighting Research Using Radiance
o  Validation Studies
o  Tutorials
o  User Experiences
o  FAQs
o  Mac Users
o  Linux Users
o  Windows Users
o  Links to Other Simulation Software
o  Other Radiance-related Websites

Each of these front-page links would then jump to a Wiki page
where visitors could add their own resources.  If after a time
we discovered that there were too many internet vandals
getting in and tagging our pages, we could disconnect
Wiki and make some or all of the pages into moderated ones,
with users having to submit ideas like they currently do.  The
problem with the current model of course is that it's slow to
change.  (In the case of radsite, glacial.)

Vandalism on Wikis is indeed extremely rare. After all, what fun
or challenge is there in crashing an open door?

But if the Wiki has any popularity (ie. can be found in search
engines), then you'll have to deal with links spammers trying to
get visibility for their online pharmacies and porn sites.
Most of those can be deterred by requiring registration, though.

Subject: [Radiance-dev] Rendering a single polygon
Message-ID: <41EE877D.3050809@familyhealth.com.au>

Hi guys,

I have a question relating to something we need to do in Radiance for 
our application.

Imagine you have a scene that describes a room.  In that room you have a 
single polygon that represents, for instance, someone's desk top.

Now, we want to find the average illumination of that person's desk top.

So, our idea is to render from a view point and direction such that the 
view plane is exactly the bounding box of the polygon, using rtrace to 
output all the illuminance at each point.

This would be pretty easy if there is some way to tell Radiance to clip 
all but a named polygon, but still render the illuminance on that 
polygon taking into account the rest of the scene.  Is there a way to do 
that?

Our pretty dodgy idea at the moment is to place a near and far clip 
plane just in front and behind of the target polygon, but that's dodgy 
to say the least :)

Any ideas?

Thanks,

Chris

Message-ID: <DC0CAEEA090E984C911D3B85B16C3F900302C399@l-gnts05>

just an alternative approach:
why do not use points instead?

you can generate x y z coordinates for a grid on the desk (done with excel)
in the form 
x y z nx ny nz

then you use:

rtrace -w- -h- -I+ option < grid | rcalc -e
'$1=179*($1*0.265+$2*0.67+$3*0.065)' > illuminance

at the end you can use excel for the chart.

OR

if you wish to improve the process:

-1-
use rcalc to generate the grid
something like:

#!/bin/csh -f
set spacingx = 0.1
set spacingy = 0.2
set numberofpointsx = 9
set numberofpointsy = 9
set height = 0.9
 cnt $numberofpointsx $numberofpointsy | rcalc -e '$1=$1'"*spacingx"';
$2=$2'"*spacingx"'; $3='"$height;"' $4 =0; $5=0; $6=1' > grid

then 

rtrace .... < grid | rcalc > illuminance

you should however improve it a little by using also rotation and
translation of grid...
(if you get in trouble just tell, I can provide further help)

-2- 

at this point you can try opendx visualizer:
it's a superb software from IBM, now free.

run very well under MacosX (it's supposed to be good on Linux and windows
too).

you can import your data and visualize them being able to spin the dataset
and apply different filters.
admesh is a must program to import 3d formats.



-2-alternative

use VTK and mayaVI or Paraview to visualize data.



hope it helps
cheers,
giulio

Yes.  What if it's an irregular polygon for instance?  Perhaps even a 
concave polygon?  Then we need to perhaps generate points in the 
bounding box of the polygon and then test each ray to ensure that it 
actually does hit the polygon before computing its illuminance.

Seems like it would be handy to have a way of getting what Radiance 
knows about the illumination of a specified polygon and outputting it 
directly?

I doubt that radiance has something like that, afaik those polygons are 
"flattened".

Would still be nice because this could be used in a number of ways... 
e.g. output of prerendered polygons to vrml, opengl, ... ?

you can use this simple grid to raytrace a 1st set of rays and get just
surface inersections and illuminances
(ir's an option of rtrace)
these data could be written to a file and used as a new grid for the
illuminance calculation
the resulting data could be displayed with opendx.

alternatively you could export point location to a file from the 3d,
if you need a way to do that you should definitely try blender + brad, I
have been told that it's really good.

last option:
however if you need to test millions of different desks prbably the full
plan view rendering is the best solution (just because it's quicker):
you can just add a mask to eliminate the floor to the final image....
viewing position is always in the center of the desk , looking down, planar

Others have worked on the problem of getting illuminance data from  
Radiance for the purpose of generating walkthroughs.  The thing is,  
Radiance doesn't keep any information on a regular grid that translates  
to vertex values.  And Radiance doesn't rely on polygons in general, so  
there are two snags.  Anyway, check out Bernhard Spanlang's  
presentation from the 2002 workshop:

	http://www.radiance-online.org/radiance-workshop1/cd/Spanlang/ 
index.html

See also Richard Gillibrand's work from the 2003 workshop:

	http://www.radiance-online.org/radiance-workshop2/cd/Gillibrand/ 
abstract.html

If you're just after the values on one polygon, one trick is to render  
the polygon by itself to figure out which rays you need to trace, then  
trace them.  Here's how I would do it:

	% vwrays -x 200 -y 200 -vf view2poly.vf -fd \
		| rtrace -h -opN -fdd `vwrays -d -x 200 -y 200 -vf view2poly.vf`  
'\!oconv poly.rad' \
		| rcalc -id6 -od -e 's(x):x*x;cond=s($4)+s($5)+s($6)-.5' -e  
'$1=$1;$2=$2;$3=$3;$4=$4;$5=$5;$6=$6' \
		| rtrace -h -fda -I [render options] scene.oct > irrad_results.dat

The vwrays command generates the rays associated with a view of the  
polygon.  The first rtrace command gets the surface points and normals  
for the rays that hit your polygon.  The rcalc command throws out rays  
whose surface normal is (0,0,0), which is what rtrace produces for rays  
that didn't hit anything.  The second rtrace  command then computes the  
irradiance for the surface points.

I didn't try this, so most likely I screwed up something, but it's a  
hint.

The sencond (inline) vwrays is superfluous, so this simplifies it a 
little bit.  Also, feel free to set the resolution to whatever makes 
sense.  I chose 200 arbitrarily, which is probably overkill for most 
applications.  Note that your view can be from anywhere, but the side 
you see of the polygon is the side you will end up sampling.

Hi!

I found that my opt-settings for gcc give about 10% additional 
performance (tested with the "bench2" set of files) on my rather old 
G4. As most folks using their Mac for rendering don't use G3 or older 
for that, I think it might be a good idea to have an option in the 
makeall script to compile on recent Macs. What do you think? Maybe even

I think it'd great to include makeall options for the various Gx
processors.  Just make sure you still include the G3, since the Father of
Radiance still runs Radiance on a G3 (when he's using his laptop)!  The
10% boost on my G4 will be appreciated.

Just imagine... the master himself posting "rpict doesn't work on my

No, the idea was not to replace the Mac OS X option, but to add an 
optimized for the folks with the brand new toys.

Ok, I get it now.  A few things though:

If we have a complex scene describing a room and a single polygon (say 
named 'target') in it somewhere, should we instead of using -opN use -os 
and then use -is -e 'cond=if($1=target, 1, 0)' or something to check 
that we've hit the particular polygon, as it is likely that every ray 
will in fact hit something.

The other problem is what if any object is between the view point and 
the target polygon?  Is there any way to trace through those objects?

And also, since we need quite an accurate rating of illuminance, we will 
need to do some trig to determine the distance between the sample 
illuminance points in the real world, in order to be able to compute 
irradiance/m^2 for example.  This will depend on the distance of the 
view point from the target and other things, which is why obstructing 
objects become a problem.

Many thanks by the way - we had no idea that 'cond' existed.  It's just 
allowed us to remove a heap of code :)

Actually, forget that - I just realised that the irradiance is viewpoint 
independent, given per m^2, so all we need to do is position a viewpoint 
such that we get a guaranteed number of samples per m^2, and use a fore 
clip plane just about the target poly to eliminate obstructions...

Hi Chris,

The idea with the first rtrace command is to render the polygon by 
itself.  You don't need a fore (or aft) clipping plane simply because 
there is *nothing* else in the scene to render.  (You'll even get a 
warning about no light sources unless you add a -w option to rtrace, 
which I forgot.)

Just an FYI, I do use a G3 laptop as Rob points out.  However, I also 
own a dual G5 desktop, so I'm not completely behind the times (although 
it's only a dual 1.8 GHz, rather than the latest 2.5 model).

Lars, I'm glad you were able to find a combination of gcc options that 
actually improves rendering speed without causing the code to hang, 
which is the problem I ran into with the -fast option.  This option is 
supposed to turn on all the local optimizations for the target 
processor, but it seems to be a bit buggy in the version of gcc 
installed on my machine, anyway (3.3 20030304, build 1671).  In 
general, I've learned the hard way to distrust the gcc optimizer, so 
I'm still running with -O2 in my rmake script.

If anyone has trouble with odd results using the faster compile, I 
suggest they first try recompiling before they tear their hair out 
trying to find the bug.

...but there's no point rendering it by itself - I need it to take into

Yes, hence the second rtrace command.

Subject: [Radiance-dev] -oN question
Message-ID: <41F11A2F.2040708@familyhealth.com.au>

Hi,

With rtrace -oN, what is the convention that Radiance uses to determine 
which direction the normal vector is returned as facing.

I was getting confused in my app as I was tracing rays from above a 
horizontal plane, and didn't realise that the normal of intersection on 
the plane was being returned as [0 0 -1] instead of the [0 0 1] as I had 
assumed.

What is the general rule for which direction the normal is returned in, 
so I can account for it?

Thanks,

Chris

Hmm, seems that the normal for that polygon is facing down.  Perhaps 
that affects it?

Hi Chris,

Yes, I think -oN returns the surface's unperturbed normal, which means 
whatever direction it has in the actual geometry is the one you get.  
If you use the -on option instead, which takes longer and may involve 
tracing additional rays, you'll get the perturbed normal that includes 
textures and any reorientation for the material type.  I think this 
would fix your problem, and wouldn't cost much since there are no light 
sources  or shading going on in your single polygon scene, anyway.

We get lots of these:

rtrace: warning - non-planar vertex for polygon "lyr_15_pol_158568312"

When using Radiance on models that we have generated using our Lightwave 
exporter.

These polys should all be "flat", but the exporter only has information 
down to 4 decimal points.

How flat does Radiance require polys to be before giving a warning?

Hi Chris,

The standard vertex epsilon in Radiance is set by the VERTEPS macro in 
src/common/face.c, and is 0.00001.  In other words, any vertex that 
exceeds this difference from the average computed plane of the polygon 
will result in a "non-planar polygon" warning.  Since your export only 
supports 4 decimal places, this will be triggered all the time.  The 
only way to avoid this error is either to switch warnings off (as I 
often do with this problem), or change VERTEPS and recompile.  Or, you 
can just ignore them.  Warnings are mostly there in Radiance to let you 
know something is not quite right, so if you spot a problem later (like 
cracks along object edges in this case), you'll have some clue as to 
its origin.
