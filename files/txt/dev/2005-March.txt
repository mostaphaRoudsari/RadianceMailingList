finally i got it, many warnings and some errors(fixed) but it works, and i
got the all radiance binaries except rananimate(a win_kill problem),

in ilink32.py i had to use
env['LINKCOM'] = '$LINK -q $LINKFLAGS $SOURCES ${_concat(LIBLINKPREFIX,
LIBS, LIBLINKSUFFIX, __env__)}'

because

env['LINKSUFFIX']='.lib' did not work

if you want i'll try to recompile and recopile the radiance building errors
and the fixes, because i have not write them
thanks,

ignacio

My guess would be the ilink32.py file in the same location.
Add a line linke this at the end of the other environment
initializations:

    env['LINKSUFFIX']='.lib'

Make sure that there are exactly four space characters in
front of the "env", because indentation is significant in Python.
If that works, then I'll submit it as another patch to SCons.

Subject: [Radiance-dev] random functions and fixed problems with specular
	reflection + roughness in cvs?
Message-ID: <755f6d0ae9beac28ca367df19f8e4ded@gmx.net>

Hi list!

Some time ago, Ignacio Mun?rriz found a problem in the code when he 
observed strange results rendering specular surfaces with high 
roughness values:

--

I was disturbed with the horizontal lines that was present in the metal
http://www.alfanature.com/avis/exteriore3b.jpg

son i took a look at the code normal.c, first discovering that the 
random
functions
lrand48(), drand48() in random.h
did not work in my computer (return always 0), so i changed them for:
[...]

I observe the same here, and that's why I wonder if the changes Ignacio 
proposed made it into the cvs tree? I want to fix these problems, and 
wonder if I have to patch a HEAD now. Or did you find that these fixes 
should better not be applied?

TIA+CU, Lars.

I finally did an makeall.bat for borland and recopiled the errors and fixes, probably the fixes are not the best because i am not (  yet  : -)  ) a good programmer ...
