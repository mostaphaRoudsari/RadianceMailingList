Hi, here is a screenshot of my .000001 version of nrv, a wxwindows opengl radiance viewer
http://www.alfanature.com/avis/screen.jpg 

Now, it comes the hard part, implement real time scene object manipulation, radiance code is not intended for objects manipulation in memory, and parse rad files in each change, ie, if i have a genbox in a rad file when i oconv it, the genbox command is lost, so i need a parser for rad files and a way to connect them with actual objects stored in memory, i've thought to make a lookup table with rad line numbers and objects, but i am a bit lost


 any advise?

Hi all, i'm yet working in a wxwindows application for interactive opengl viewing mixing glrad and rview, for rview i am using a separate process with rtrace, so i dont get idle the main application, but i have a problem when i change the view(interative) all the values sended to rtrace must be erased, i've thinked to use the  rtrace persistent mode but it doesn't go under windows(F_SETLKW undefined) is'nt it?

Hi all again, i've got no answers to my questions, and i am wondering if i am doing something wrong.
can i make a wxwindows version of radiance? can it be comercial? is radiance open source? do you see something bad?

please answer me, i'm a bit disapointed, probably radiance is the most amazing program i've ever seen, and i'm greg's fan.

please, If i'm disturbing anybody i would like to know it

Sure. A nicer GUI would be good. And the non-X11 (Windows and OS/X) users 
would probably like a native replacement for rview/rvu.

> can it be comercial?  is radiance open source? do you see something bad?

The license (http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/misc/license.txt) appears to 
be something like the BSD license. I'm not a lawyer though, and don't even 
play one on TV. But it looks like you can take the source code and do 
pretty much anything you want, just keep a little copyright notice somewhere.

One thing to remember is that reputation is everything in the Open Source 
world. Act like a jerk and people here won't help you. But play nice (like 
say, adding value and providing an actual service) and so will everyone 
else. Basically don't leach off of the free developers. And giving 
something back to the community is always good for relations.

Hi Ignacio,

Sorry for the lack of response, but the dev list is often pretty  
quiet compared to radiance-general.  Your questions are appropriate  
to this list, though, so we should probably keep this discussion here  
for now.

My personal excuse for not responding to your post is that I tend to  
ignore all things Windows.  I didn't even know what "wxWindows" was  
before looking it up on the web this morning, so I didn't feel I had  
much to offer the discussion.  In general, I don't like to parade my  
ignorance on this list, as it tends to undermine my image as "the guy  
who knows what he's talking about."

Nevertheless, I do want to see a standard Windows version of Radiance  
get out sometime soon.  It's been way too long coming, and I'm  
getting really tired of hearing desperate questions from Desktop  
Radiance users.  It's great to see someone taking the work Schorsch  
has done and putting it to good use.

With that, let me pull up some of your old e-mails...

Looks very nice, though I'm wondering what your intentions are  
relative to other CAD methods for editing Radiance descriptions, such  
as the export function Francesco Anselmo has written for Blender:

     http://www.dream.unipa.it/dream/pub/dot/anselmo/radiance/06.php

What are your motivations, goals, etc.?  Without spelling some of  
these things out, it's difficult to know when and how others might  
help you.

If I were trying to maintain a native Radiance description in an  
editor, I'd probably require the user or CAD system isolate objects  
in separate scene files.  My editor would then place these with the  
appropriate  xform's or instances (a la replmarks) in the main scene,  
possibly building a hierarchy.  I wouldn't attempt to parse all the  
various scene-generating commands in Radiance, particularly because  
users are allowed and encouraged to write their own.

Yes, I think that the persistent mode of rtrace and rpict have been a  
persistent problem under Windows, so to speak.  Why don't you simply  
track which rays belong with which views, and discard returned rays  
from the previous view(s)?  That way, you don't have to restart  
rtrace, which is bound to be a lot more expensive than discarding a  
few rays.  So long as your input queue to rtrace is held to a  
reasonable length, i.e., the average number of rays it computes in a  
second, the delay should be tolerable.  This is the approach I take  
in rholo, for instance.

No, it's just that Schorsch and I are the main responders on this  
list, and as I have explained I tend to leave Windows stuff for  
Schorsch.  His response pattern is month-long periods of silence  
followed by a burst of activity, and I assume this reflects his  
workload.  Don't take it personally -- I never do.

I'm not sure if Radiance fits the strictest definition of OpenSource,  
but there are no restrictions in the license on its use, only the  
usual disclaimers.  Ian is right that you can do pretty much whatever  
you like with it, so long as the original license accompanies any  
redistribution.

Even one simplistic reference Windows implementation
of rview would probably be a good idea.

I never do.

That's what they keep telling me about all my classic
corporate America bosses. Oh, they are so busy! Don't
take it personally that he is mostly concerned with
his own bank account :)

In that spirit Greg, I think you should open up more
to the corporate USA platform of choice - Windows.

Just a joke! Happy Memorial Day weekend!

Tony

Thanks all , i started to feel bad, as artist i'm very "sensitive", you
know. :-)

Greg : "What are your motivations, goals, etc.?  Without spelling some of
these things out, it's difficult to know when and how others might
help you."

I work in a spanish version of Visarc and i thought, as many people, that a
realtime
architecture visualizer would be cool for my work. Rholo is a very powerful
program, but
has the problem that in architecture straight lines(edges) are very
important , and rholo gets (still) a bit
slowly the refined image.

Now i am merging rview and glrad, so you can swicth from one to other with
an icon click. In future i
would like to reuse glrad opengl depth values to optimize the rview ray
intersects, and try to find other
ways to optimizing rview speed without compromising accurate, althought i'm
sure it will be a hard work
because greg has done a very good work.

merging rview and glrad over a windows system i've found some problems, as
glrad uses for mesh conversion
the same pointer to functions as rview for ray intersects (face, sphere...),
it is resolved using a exernal rtrace
process for rview that in addition alows not to idle the windows enviroment.

Ian : "Sure. A nicer GUI would be good. And the non-X11 (Windows and OS/X)
users
would probably like a native replacement for rview/rvu."

I would like to make a very easy program, so all windows users can use it
but also hold every possible radiance
options and ways of work so advanced users can use it too.


"If I were trying to maintain a native Radiance description in an
editor, I'd probably require the user or CAD system isolate objects
in separate scene files.  My editor would then place these with the
appropriate  xform's or instances (a la replmarks) in the main scene,
possibly building a hierarchy.  I wouldn't attempt to parse all the
various scene-generating commands in Radiance, particularly because
users are allowed and encouraged to write their own."

Yes i got the same conclusion,and i think it will be the best way. but i'm
now wondering what can i do
with material edition. a parser the erases all material definitions and
creates a memory structure and
 an additional material file?

"Yes, I think that the persistent mode of rtrace and rpict have been a

yes but it would be very nice that rview can show something( 1,4,8.. nodes)
at interactive speed(while orbiting, dolling ...), isnt it?

The problem there is that Radiance allows you to redefine materials  
along the way (i.e., reuse material names), so taking in arbitrary  
files, you would need to also rename materials that collided.  You  
could of course do so, but it wouldn't always be the most sensible  
strategy.  The output of gensurf -s for example redefines the  
modifier "Phong" once for each polygon, since it has to apply a  
different texture to each.  Creating a material for each polygon in a  
tessellated surface that could contain hundreds of thousands of  
polygons might be a problem.

Nice, but not necessary, and not possible either if you have to  
restart rtrace on multiple nodes to do it.  What I do in rholo is  
reproject samples from the previous view, which although not  
technically accurate, gives better feedback than Gouraud-shaded  
polygons.
