You don't cause me worry, but others will be bothered.
Windows breaks on half-a-dozen characters which are perfectly handled by 
UNIX shells.  Some backup programs (take HP's Omniback as an example) 
fail on some of these too. Shells treat spaces as default delimiters. 
It's all stupid, but it is a fact. That's why there's a somewhat 
friendly common sense not to use characters which cause problems on 
other systems (like space, double colon, ambersands, etc) volantarily. 
If you insist on a space in a directory name of a general test scenario 
and declare the whole directory, which serves others purposes, a test 
case for filename handling, that's fine, but a little pointless IMHO.

Hi Greg and Georg,

I've just re-compiled Radiance with mingw, and it has been easier.
Also, the rtcontrib file output problem has disappeared, and I think
it has been fixed at revision 1.27

Here is the list of changes I've done to the Scons scripts,
I hope this time they make more sense:

diff -r ray/platform/mingw.cfg ray_ok/platform/mingw.cfg

< CPPDEFINES: _WIN32 _DEBUG _CONSOLE _MBCS HDSUF=.exe fseeko=fseek
---
> CPPDEFINES: _WIN32 MINGW _DEBUG _CONSOLE _MBCS HDSUF=.exe fseeko=fseek

(I've added the MINGW macro to fix the following problem in rpict)

16a17

17a19,21

(this is because <sys/times.h> is not available with mingw,
while <sys/time.h> is)

(I've taken mkillum out of the prog targets, because it needs "socketlib",
and slightly changed the mksource library list)

(worked only when I moved rtproc to the end of the list)

Subject: [Radiance-dev] I'd like to create a branch for the project
Message-ID: <op.syppd3hjupgjca@localhost>

...but I'm not really sure where to start!

Hello all, it's nice to meet you. I'm 21, from England, and I like to  
code. I'm studying Computer Science at University, which I would like to  
take into a career of graphical programming. But I think now's the time to  
start working on my CV, and getting to grips with programming projects  
like those I would like to work on out of college, because I guess I ought  
to develop myself as a programmer (& I enjoy it!).

The situation that I'm in is that I'd like to start some branch of project  
work that I can independently work on, but I really don't know where to  
begin, or what contribution you would need....my scope of ambition isn't  
that huge - I'm basically looking for something useful that I could  
produce for this project, written in c/c++ (but I'm flexible), that an  
intermediate level programmer could accomplish.

I have attempted contribution to such projects before, but am often  
presented with a situation where I'm coming into the project as a  
newcomer, and I'm directed to a hoard of code (tens of megabytes), and  
it's not that useful. But I'd really like to create/work on little useful  
branch I could do for this application. By that I mean, I envision a  
project that (hopefully!) implements some useful algorithm(s), that I can  
actually research and turn into code myself (even if it's just as a  
starter, that could lead to more), but I'm not really sure what the  
project needs, or where I should start looking. I'd really appreciate it  
if someone could give me some guidance on this - I know a little about  
stuff like Bezier curves, Matlab, Markov models, and the kind of stuff  
that undergraduates know about. But I'm willing to do more, and put quite  
a bit of time into it.

			Anyway, thanks for any guidance you can give me,

			     I just re-read it, and it sounds a bit desperate, but, it's  
sincere.

Hello Mayur,

Thank you for your generous offer of help.  In Radiance, what we  
mostly need assistance with at this point is porting work to the  
Windows platform.  Specifically, we need to replace some of the Unix  
system facilities, such as subprocesses, interprocess communication,  
and file locking, and make these work under Windows via system- 
independent interfaces.  In addition, we have a few programs that  
produce graphical output using OpenGL or X11, which we need to get  
ported to Windows.

Here is a partial list of separable tasks we need to complete, for  
which we have scarce resources (quoting Georg Mischler):

  lock files
    Very easy to split as a seperate subproject with a clearly
    defined and simple API. High priority in my opinion.

  Persistence for rtrace and rpict
    Introduce an abstract level in rt/persist.c, so that fork/exec
    can be hidden and replaced with an equivalent on Windows.

  Parallel rendering
    Introduce an abstract layer in rt/raypcalls.c and rt/r[pt]main.c,
    so that fork/exec can be hidden and replaced with an equivalent
    on Windows.
    Among other things, this would make it possible to port ranimove.

    Introduce an abstract layer for next_process() in rad.c, so that
    fork/exec can be hidden and replaced with an equivalent on Windows.

    Introduce an abstract layer for putpiece() in rpiece.c, so that
    fork/exec can be hidden and replaced with an equivalent on Windows.

For the graphics porting, we have three programs, the third of which  
would be significantly more challenging:

rvu driver
     Need to be able to write out 24-bit colored rectangles and take  
textual user input.

ximage
     Need to port X11 picture display program to Windows

rholo
     Need to write OpenGL display driver for interactive holodeck system

If any of these seem interesting or doable to you, let us know and we  
can fill you in with more details and provide you with a starting  
point in the source tree.

If you are principally interested in lighting simulation and graphics  
algorithms, as opposed to the more systems-related work we have  
slated, you are welcome to take the source code and experiment with it.

Hi,

is the license located here the most recent license?

http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/announcement.html

The reason I ask is that I'm fairly certain that I had read a page
that stated that radiance had been changed to a license that was GPL
compatible (i don't recall if it was BSD, MIT, LGPL, or another), but
now I cannot find the page again even after extensive google
searching,

Thanks for your time,

Hi,

as I understand that mkillum does nothing more than starting rtraces 
for each surfaces it processes, I wonder if there is someone out there 
on the list who might want to try implementing a multi-processing 
version... :-) afaik each process is rather independent on others, so 
the task should be not too big if only one knows the infinite wisdom of 
radiance's source tree...

Hi Tom,

The current license is contained in the "copyright.h" header in the  
ray/src/common directory, attached.  I don't know whether or not it  
is GPL-compatible.  Perhaps you can tell me.

Hi,

sorry, I really did not know that. In fact, I am using the 
online-manpages from radsite.lbl.gov quite often, and these are from 
2003, so they didn't mention the -n option.

Yeah, I really should keep the online pages updated, but the

Hi Greg,

thank you for your response,

I contacted the Free Software Foundation and they stated that the
license is GPL incompatible.

However there is a more recent license (I think it is revision of the
license you are using) used by many Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory projects that is GPL compatible

Hi Tom,

Thanks for the links.  If you think the current license is in some  
way inadequate, I suggest you write to Steve Selkowitz at LBNL  
directly, as I don't understand licenses or care about them much.   
The current license came from the patent office at LBNL, and I had  
nothing to do with it other than to stuff it into the distribution.   
I know the general purpose is to provide for the free use of the  
software for any purpose, and to protect LBNL and the UC Regents from  
any liability.

Hi Tom,
 
I was working at LBNL during the time that the Radiance license was working its way through the LBNL Patents office.  This was during Greg's stint at SGI then Shutterfly when I acted as the surrogate (illigitimate) father of Radiance.  It was a long and sordid trail through the anals of a huge bureaucracy.  I think I first brought up the idea of an open source license in 1992.  There were at least five different stakeholders whose interests had to be balanced in coming up with the license that exists now.  But before we could even get the Patents office attention, we had to show that it was a commercially viable technology and that it wasn't stepping on any big player's toes.  It was through the sales of 3 or 4 $10,000 older-style licenses to folks like Georg Mischler that got their attention.  I did quite a bit of patent research and found some potentially conflicting claims held by Pixar for stuff related to pseudo-random adaptive subdivision of the image plane.  This was resolved
 by writing Pixar a letter telling them our plans and never getting a response.  And strangely enough, once the LBNL patents office had some money to stash away to help in the legal defence against the possibility that someone could become "harmed" by using Radiance, they were then willing to listen to another, less costly, open-source-like licensing scheme.  We hammered on them about various license schemes including GPL and OSF, etc.  The final touches on the license were completed after I moved onto greener pastures.  But in the end, what we've got is much better than we expected.  My suggestion is not to bother the likes of Steve Selkowitz, and to make what we've got work for you, and if it doesn't, look for your ray tracing solution elsewhere.
 
-Chas
