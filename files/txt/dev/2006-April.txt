Ladies & Gentlemen,

I've hit this little problem with the mingw radiance binaries I've
compiled last october.
If I run this command to produce separate pictures for each light
source:

vwrays -ff -x 1024 -y 1024 -vf v3.vf | rtcontrib -ffc -x 1024 -y 1024 \
-ld- @render.opt -o c_%s.pic -m solar -m skyglow -m spot testSky.oct

I get the following error:
-----
bin/rtrace: consistency - zero ray direction in localhit

This application has requested the Runtime to terminate it in an unusual
way.
Please contact the application's support team for more information. 
rtcontrib: fatal - rtrace process died
-----

If, instead of using floating point values, I use ASCII, like this:

vwrays -fa -x 1024 -y 1024 -vf v3.vf | rtcontrib -fac -x 1024 -y 1024 \
-ld- @render.opt -o c_%s.pic -m solar -m skyglow -m spot testSky.oct

everything works smoothly.

Does anybody have any clue about it? I suspect it is directly related to
the mingw gcc, but it may be something else, you never know what happens
in Redmond ...

Grazie!

Francesco

Hi Francesco,

What is the date on your compile?  I notice I made a change on Oct.  
11th, where I paid more attention to zero normals on the input.  I'm  
just speculating, but if your view is a hemispherical fisheye, then  
all its border rays will be zero vectors, which could accumulate in a  
bad way using binary i/o and the earlier version of rtcontrib.c,  
perhaps causing some kind of buffer confusion.  I'm not exactly sure  
why it would show up in one mode and not the other, though.  Can you  
reproduce the problem under Unix?

-Greg

Hi Greg,

> Can you reproduce the problem under Unix?

With Unix everything is working well, that's why i'm thinking of a
windows shell pipeline problem or directly of mingw gcc.
BTW, the view specification in my test is not a hemispherical fisheye,
so the problem you're referring to should not happen in this case.
In any case I'll recompile a fresh radiance tarball and let you know.

Thanks,

Francesco

Hi Greg,

I've just finished recompiling a fresh radiance tarball with mingw, and
also under cygwin and linux.

The behaviour of vwrays+rtcontrib is similar with both cygwin and
linux, that is -fa and -ff work perfectly.

It is only with the mingw binaries that I have problems, or I should
probably say that it is a limitation of the windows command shell,
that doesn't seem to handle concatenation of binary input/output ...
The more I use windows, the less I want to use it ...

I think I only need to test the mingw binaries from the cygwin shell
to identify the problem and prove what my intuition is suggesting ...

Thanks,

Francesco

Hi Francesco,

I remember this used to be a problem way back in 1990(?) when I first  
compiled Radiance under MS-DOS, but I would think they'd have fixed  
it by now...  I guess it wouldn't be the first thing that never got  
fixed.  Maybe it's a "feature?"

-Greg
