Absolutely yes, you can transfer ownership/management of the domain  
without letting it expire first.  That could be set up in advance of  
the physical server change.  Pending LBNL's response to Greg's  
request that they host the site, I can ask my friend who hosts my  
personal website if he's interested in picking this up.  He's got a  
nice server in a colo in Seattle and he is the CTO of a large  
eCommerce site; he knows how to run a website.  He's open to  
installing most software and ssh access is a given, so it could be a  
good hosting option of the LBNL thing falls through.  Greg, let me know.

Peter, a huge Thank You to you for setting up and running radiance- 
online.org.  I agree with Jack that your site (and especially the  
list) has been instrumental in invigorating the interest and support  
of this great program called Radiance. Thanks!

Hi.

As things start to develop rather fast at the moment, I will add some ideas to the discussion.

As some may or may not memember, I asked about some kind of Radiance Knowledge Base some time ago, as I found the wiki to be dead. After that, at least documentation projects were started, one being some kind of keyword-based and directory (Axel's project, I think he will show us more soon ;-) with ranking to make information available, the other an attempt to implement the collaborative writing ideas discussed here I started using the CMS called Drupal, which offers a content type called book that not only can be edited, but also ex- and imported for those working offline and even, still limited, export to docbook. It is also possible to use tex-written content (useful for the maths and not unimportant for Radiance). As I did plan to first stabilize and fill with some content, I had not announced this, but the site's skeleton is available at radiance.free-architecture.org. Actually I would prefer it to be integrated into radiance-online as close as possible.

If a new Radiance site is set up, I offer to move all my existing efforts over to that. So please think over how useful the integration of this documentation effort would be, and consider even taking the installation as a CMS for the new site.

Second, I asked people from my old university if it is possible to host the site. I did not get any answer, but maybe it is one more option to choose. It would add Solaris to the list of platform/OS options. But actually, for web services, I never saw much of a difference between all the unix-likes.

CU Lars.

The problem with academic sponsorship might be that we have to
ask for (and have approved) any new service we want to offer.
If we don't know the right person to ask this could take a
long time. As well I'm not sure their admins would be happy
with people messing around on one of their machines who are
not directly connected to the institute.

OTOH I obviously had a wrong idea about hosting prices these
days ... From the financial point of view any sponsorship would
be preferred. If we can get a liberal (internet) sponsor I'd be
happy to help setting things up there. But I'd think twice if
it includes restrictions about what we can do with the site.

It is a great idea to consolidate any knowledge out there.
A tidy radiance-online.org would be a good start.

Hi.

So after last week's mail traffic peak it got calm here again. Who will 
take over the domain? Did you ask at lbl, Greg? I did not get an answer 
so far from my ex-university.

Did anybody consider my content-management proposal? If you want I can 
activate some functions that may be necessary for a general web-site 
(and which I have switched off until now to make the environment easier 
for the documentation-only project). If it sounds interesting to you (at 
least as an option so that we should play around with and try it), I am 
willing to give some afternoons to work on it, so that it may become the 
base for a future radiance-online.org transition. If not, I will spend 
the time doing some day- and sunlight studies at the sea instead. ;-)

CU Lars.

Hi Lars,

I inquired with Stephen Selkowitz at LBNL, who expressed an interest  
in assuming the radiance-online.org domain and revitalizing the  
Radiance website.  I will attempt to meet with him on the topic this  
week, but since I will be gone for a month starting Monday, this  
isn't the best time for me to oversee such an operation.  Not that  
I'm the best person to do it, anyway.  I think if we can get Steve to  
agree and Danny Fuller at LBNL talking with Peter A-B, the wheels  
will be in proper motion.

I guess it's time to crawl out from under my rock once again...

It may make sense to split the job into the following parts:

1) CVS
2) Source and binary downloads
3) Mailing lists
4) Mailing list archives
5) General introduction and links
6) Workshop data
7) Knowledge base (future)

The first three can easily be solved on Sourceforge. I already
run a project there, and would have no problem to set up another
one. Unfortunately, their mailing list archive functionality
is suboptimal, so we better keep item 4) on a seperate site.

I can host another domain on my account at www.pair.com for 1 USD
per Month. It should not be too much work (I hope) to maintain
the mailing list archives and the general information pages there.
The easiest way to distribute the workload would be to turn the
complete site (minus the archives) into a wiki. Most of the
currently static pages could be made dynamic, so that the members
of the community can help to keep them up to date. The wiki
technology then allows to grow that into a more complete
knowledgebase collaboratively over time.

The only problem are the presentations from the Workshops,
because of their sheer volume. If we want to keep those CDs
online both as ISO images and for direct access, then we need a
place to store up to 1.5 GB of data per year. Since this data
never changes once it has been posted, maybe Radsite at LBNL
would be a good place to host it. That way they could help us the
most with the least maintenance effort at their end.

I'm still waiting for Peter do divulge a few real life figures
about work effort, disk usage, and bandwidth requirements. The
latter shouldn't be a problem as I have 200GB/month to burn, but
knowing more about the first two would make it easier to decide
about the best way to proceed.

over the last year or so, I have neglected the Radiance community
(and others) much more than I would have liked. I'm not sure if
I'll have much more time available for active development in the
future, but I'd be happy to offer some support for the community
infrastructure. Keeping an eye on a few mostly automated
procedures should be well within my capacities.  I am already
familiar with both Mailman (for the archives) and MoinMoin (for
the wiki), so it's just a matter of configuring another instance
of each for this domain.

LBNL could certainly host the workshop data, along with the official  
software downloads, which are already on there.  We need to link the  
CVS system with the HEAD distribution, obviously, and it would be  
great if you could manage that.  That just leaves the mailing lists,  
which I could manage if necessary, though I'd love to have someone  
else volunteer to act as administrator.  This mostly involves  
discarding messages missed by the spam filter these days.

The knowledge base is the main part that needs work, and I don't know  
enough about wiki's and the various other options to have an opinion  
on that.

Now that os x supports stereo gl on the g5 quad with the nvidia  
quadro fx 4500 card I would like to build a stereo version of  
Radiance. If I remove the -DNOSTEREO argument from mach= in the OS X  
case in makeall it fails because in glrad.c it can't find X11/ 
extensions/SGIStereo.h. Is there some documentation about what the  
code is trying to do so that I can substitute the appropriate os x

figure out what is in the includes.

Thank you,

Hi Doug,

Documentation for Radiance source code is scant, and I can't remember  
how the stereo mode in the old SGI's worked all that well, other than  
the fact that it used two frame buffers and the pixel aspect ratio  
could change.

If you search for all occurrences of STEREO in rhd_ogl.c, you will  
find the places where code changes may be necessary, but I can't  
really advise you on what they should be for the G5 quad's stereo  
option.

If you get this to work, I'll be happy to do my part and  
reincorporate it back into the main distribution.

Best of luck!

That sounds mostly like general system administration chores.
The folks at Pair Networks do a great job at keeping their
systems secure and up to date, so I don't need to worry about
most of this.

Since Peter didn't say much about working on the web site as
such, I assume that part is almost neglectible in comparison.
Obviously, there will be some effort required to configure
everything, but I don't expect much recurring work to be
necessary.

It should be possible to set up a cron job at Sourceforge to
create the HEAD dump automatically (and serve it from there).
At the same time, we'll have read-only CVS access for everybody,
so that a nightly dump may not be quite as important anymore as
it used to be.

Downloads from Sourceforge are mirrored by dozens of sites all
around the world, so that we won't really need to duplicate the
downloads at LBNL anymore.

Administrative duties for the mailing lists can easily be shared
between several people. I can also delegate administrative
priveledges to some of the Wiki users.

Since we have a rather small pool of active users, keeping the
administrative overhead down is crucial. And for a site intended
to collaboratively collect documentation, a Wiki is the simplest
solution for everybody.

Umm...  this is the first mention of Sourceforge.  Other than the  
dozens of mirror sites and mass confusion that results, is there any  
advantage to going this route?  Would we lose the nice CVS source  
tree access Peter's set up at <http://www.radiance-online.org/cgi-bin/ 
viewcvs.cgi/>?  I have no problem with read-only CVS access, though I  
don't find the system terribly convenient, myself.

Oh yeah, SF has their own version of viewcvs. The web interface is
annoying, but at least it's comprehensive.

But I would recommend against SourceForge. IMHO they've been going
downhill over the last few years. Many times I've tried to update some SF
project via anonymous CVS and found the CVS server not responding. I'd
only use SF as a last resort.

Hi,

I've been using Savannah for b/rad:

http://savannah.nongnu.org/ 
http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/brad

They offer CVS, website hosting (no dynamic scripts), 
mailing lists management and other goodies (bug tracking,
support tracking, task management, patch tracking)
Here is a FAQ about their services:
http://savannah.gnu.org/faq/?group=administration

I think they use Mailman for the MLs
http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/brad/

The nicest thing is there is no commercial advertising.

It is not the kind of automated service like SF, there are
administrators who answer your queries. To accept the project
the Radiance licence needs to be compatible with GNU GPL
http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/license-list.html
so there will be somebody reviewing it and it usually takes
a couple of days.

I think I had a conversation with an administrator about the
Radiance license some time ago, and he said it is compatible.

Francesco

They have had some massive problems over the last few months with CVS. 
At least two projects I use have moved off SF for that reason. I would 
suggest at least waiting to see if their problems are fixed.

  On 2006-05-12 the replacement CVS infrastructure was put into
  place and enabled for general use, following the critical CVS
  failures in the previous infrastructure in the preceding weeks.
  The new infrastructure provides for enhancements in
  performance, a large reduction in the sync delay, greater
  scalability and elimination of several single points of
  failure...

Just last week they migrated their list servers, resulting in a 
significant disruption. I just suggest waiting until all of this shakes 
out. If it ain't broke don't fix it.

The advantage is that we'll get the same functionality as we have
now (and much more), just without the administrative overhead.
Nobody will get confused if they try to download a file and are
offered a selection of sources to get it from. It's just one more
click.

I don't see LBNL installing, running, continuously updating, and
administrating a public CVS server, and I am certainly not in a
position to do it myself. Since nobody has presented a workable
alternative so far, there is no choice but to use Sourceforge or
a similar service. Francesco has suggested Savannah, which seems
to be something similar, although with much less functionality.
It might still be sufficient for what we need, though.

There are a few other (usually smaller) sites that do similar
things. I have only worked with Sourceforge myself, so I don't
know how well the others work. Obviously, Sourceforge will catch
the most flak when something goes wrong, simply because of their
large number of users. On the other hand, thousands of projects
are still quite happy with them, especially now that the CVS and
mailing list services have been upgraded.


But the most urgent question is what happens with the domain.
If we get too close to the expiry date, then Netsol will block
any transfer attempts until after the next period has been paid
for. Since Netsol is one of the most expensive registrars, we
probably don't want that to happen. So whoever gets assigned as
the future host of radiance-online.org should initiate the domain
transfer immediately. After that we still have time to figure out
all the other details.

The first one is up:
http://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/radiance_workshops/index.html

Does everybody feel that the ISO images are really necessary? It's easier
to turn a ZIP into an ISO than the other way 'round. At the moment, there
is
a) HTML tree of presentations,
b) ISO images
c) ZIP archives of a)

While a) is important to have on-line, I think it should be b) OR c), not
b) AND c). Total of 3.3 GB.

Any thoughts?

Cheers

Axel

I do not think so. Online (html) access and offline archives (zip) 
should be enough. And will decrease traffic. Lars.

Just to ensure we don't start heading 6 directions at once, I am  
continuing discussions with Peter and LBL regarding transfer of the  
radiance-online.org domain to an LBL server.  This won't mean that  
anyone will be shut out of content management -- quite the contrary.   
We will need all the help we can get putting this together and  
developing it further, the hope being to collate information that's  
currently scattered.  As a start, we plan to transfer what currently  
lives on PAB's server to an LBL-hosted site.  Once this is stable,  
we'll invite others to join in content creation and management, and  
if someone wants to mirror the site in Europe, that would be great.   
We're trying to avoid the situation of burdening people with IT  
management that isn't all that fun in the long run, while encouraging  
others to participate in the content, which is the rewarding part.

-Greg

Apologies for getting ahead of myself. The last messages on the subject
did not give the impression that something was definitely going to happen,
so I figured it would be easier finding a new host for radiance-online
MINUS most of the large, chunky bits.

Now I understand that help is not required.
