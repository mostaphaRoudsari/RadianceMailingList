I think also oconv and the intersection tests (rt/o_*) would benefit, 
BUT: altivec supports float at most, while vectors (fvect) in radiance 
usually are doubles as long as I do not define SMLFLT. That means there 
is really no hope at the moment.

Hi Lars,

I don't know what's going on with Version.c -- try removing it and  
running "rmake Version.c" in your src/rt directory.  Send me the  
output if there's an error.

As for nanosleep(), it's probably in some odd library.  Run "man  
nanosleep" and see what library it says it's in.  If you can't add  
the appropriate link option to the Rmakefile in src/hd, try removing  
the calls from rhd_ogl.c and rhd_x11.c.  They aren't essential.

nanosleep for Solaris is in lib rt:

$ nm -D /usr/lib/librt.so | grep nanosleep
[76]    |         0|       0|FUNC |GLOB |0    |UNDEF  |__nanosleep
[104]   |     10848|      36|FUNC |GLOB |0    |10     |_nanosleep
[170]   |     10848|      36|FUNC |WEAK |0    |10     |nanosleep

So I think you can see a problem, the name clash this the radiance
rt lib.  To compile I patch to change the name of the radiance librt.a
lib to libradrt.a and -lrt to -lradrt throughout.  As the static lib
is temporary this affects build only.

Would be great if similar renaming was made to the distribution's
makefiles.

I seem to recall running across this problem under Solaris years  
ago.  I can't believe they haven't renamed their library by now, so  
it doesn't conflict with mine!

An easy workaround is to put it on the compile line explicitly as "/ 
usr/lib/librt.so" instead of the shorthand -lrt, which is  already  
there.  Since no other system uses it and I can't add -lrt  to the  
Rmakefile anyway, you might as well give the full path for Solaris.

In other words, I could rename my library, but it would only save you  
and other Solaris users from typing 14 characters, while requiring  
that I alter every makefile in Radiance.  Even if I make the changes,  
you still need to go in and edit your src/hd/Rmakefile to add the  
real-time library link.

Fair point although you do provide a makeall and platform/sunos.cfg
which could take care of it.
 
These 14 characters are needed in several places, for each new
release and by each user.  I will cope as I have been, I edit the
make files for other reasons anyway.

More importantly, I hope anyone else with the problem will read this
and now know what to do.

Hi James,

Schorsch is the one working on the Python build scripts, which as you  
say can probably take care of this handily.  To get it to work using  
the Rmakefile's and makeall, I would have to add a libraries option  
specific to the hd directory, which would be a very ugly solution.

I agree that it should be in there, but I don't have access to a  
Solaris system so it's a bit difficult for me to even test out a  
solution.

The Python build system doesn't build one big library but several
smaller ones, so it didn't have this problem.

On the other side, I have taken the liberty of modifying all the
Rmakefiles, renaming the library from librt.a to librtrad.a.
This was mostly a straightforward search and replace operation,
without any obvious difficulties. I'm sure people will start to
scream soon, should I have broken anything in the proces...

Hi Schorsch,

Welcome back -- a lot of folks have been asking after you, wondering  
where you went.  Madagascar, again?

Thanks for updating the library links.  I tested out your changes,  
and from what I can tell it all seems to work.  (Of course, I had to  
go and fix my external projects that link to the Radiance library,  
but that wasn't such a big deal.)

Subject: [Radiance-dev] -DSMLFLT still supported?
Message-ID: <44134044.7080602@gmx.net>

Hi!

I recently tried to compile with -DSMLFLT. I guess there are not many 
out there using this any more. Still I wonder if this mode is still 
"supported". I had expected errors with oconv when assembling large 
scenes, but I got segfaults, and that seams to indicate that error 
checking is not clean for DSMLFLT.

The reason for my attempt to use the good old single float was to try 
the effect when used together with modern processor's float capabilities.

Hi Lars,

I can give this a try, but debugging is a real pain these days  
without the help of an IDE.  If you can get a backtrace with symbols  
showing where the program crashed from your core dump, I might be  
able to find the error by inspection.  Basically, no one has used the  
SMLFLT flag for ages, and the code hasn't been tested with it for at  
least 10 years.  The cracks that appear in geometric objects are  
enough to scare anyone off this option in practice.
