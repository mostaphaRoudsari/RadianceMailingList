Hi Oskar,

I'm moving this to the Radiance development list, since it is a code  
issue that's of limited use to others.  Please respond there rather  
than replying to this.  (You will need to subscribe first if you  
aren't already on that list at <http://www.radiance-online.org/ 
mailman/listinfo/radiance-dev>.)

Definitely run both versions of ximage on both machines after  
compiling with -DDEBUG, because the visual selection code changed  
considerably between 3.1.11 and 3.7.2.  It seems the color table code  
also changed, though, and the problem might be there.

Dear all,

I've been working on a new site which tries to pull all the RADIANCE
related info that is OUT THERE together. It is based on keywords and a
ranking system with voting.

The site is working, I am just waiting for our new .eu domain to go up, so
bear with me.

In the meantime, may I ask for your feedback regarding the keywords. While
I can easily add new ones as we go along, changing existing ones (or
dropping them) is more difficult. Here is what I thought:

    * AddOns
    * Ambient
    * Daylighting
    * Generators
    * HDR
    * Materials
    * Modelling
    * Patterns
    * Scripting
    * Textures
    * Tutorial

Is any of them not sensible to have?
Should any be renamed?
Other ones?

In general, where possible would it be better to
a) use the noun rather than the gerund, e.g. scripts/scripting;
b) prefer plural over singular, e.g. patterns/pattern.

I am trying to make them as consistent as possible. The site has a
suggest-new-keywords form, so adding to the list is easy-peacy.

Thanks for your thoughts

Axel

Hi Axel,

This sounds like a great plan to me -- very much along the lines of  
what Peter and I and others have been discussing.  I guess you didn't  
see the proposal I put together last November (attached).  Many  
objected to my proposal as impractical, which it probably is.  Your  
approach sounds like it will work, though.

The keywords you have look good.  You can also mine the old archive  
lists for other keywords, i.e.:

	http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/digests_html/topickey.html

To your keywords, you might add:

	CalculationParameters
	Animation
	Reference (basic references)
	Principles (method references)
	Validation
	Commands (man pages)

Rename these as you see fit to make them understandable.

I'm so glad you're doing this!

-Greg

-------------- November 2005 Radiance Documentation Site Proposal  
-----------

BACKGROUND

Since its initial release in 1989, LBNL's Radiance software has  
steadily gained in capabilities and popularity to where it is now  
respected as the world's most advanced lighting simulation and  
rendering system for daylight design.  Today, over a dozen commercial  
packages employ some version of Radiance as their primary calculation  
engine, and for the past four years, an international community of  
users, developers, and researchers have been actively communicating  
on a public mailing list and attending an annual workshop dedicated  
to this package.  By a recent survey, about half of those who perform  
daylighting simulation (knowingly or unknowingly) use some version of  
Radiance.  The other half employ a variety of different calculation  
engines, with no close second in terms of overall popularity.

The Radiance package itself consists of over 100 individual programs,  
which are designed to be used in combination following the UNIX  
"toolbox" model.  This power and flexibility comes at a price, which  
is the time it takes to learn such a complex system.  Although the  
basics can be handled with just a few essential commands, even these  
are subtle and take time to master compared to a more typical menu- 
driven application.  Even with the help of the book, "Rendering with  
Radiance: The Art and Science of Lighting Visualization," potential  
users are scared off by the learning curve, or give up at some point  
in favor of simpler tools.  Our most dedicated users are those who,  
after one or more false starts, realized that the only way to solve  
their challenging daylighting problems was to buckle down and learn  
Radiance.

Because people come to Radiance with hard problems to solve,  
oftentimes the basics are not enough.  In many cases, they need to  
fathom some lesser-used aspect of the system particular to their  
task, and for this the primary text may not have the answer.  So,  
they browse reference material on the Radiance websites and other  
sites, searching for relevant information.  Failing that, or perhaps  
before searching, they ask the online community, who frequently know  
the answers already or can point to appropriate references where the  
answers may be found.  Frequently, a respondent will take the time to  
work through another user's problem, to everyone's benefit.  The  
nature of freeware encourages this sort of interaction, where people  
feel indebted to the software developers and to other users for  
support they received when they were starting out themselves.

Although there is a wealth of information available on Radiance in  
the form of manuals, technical reports, tutorials, articles, e-mail  
archives, and notes, this documentation is loosely organized and in  
some cases difficult to track down for the average user.  This is  
partially compensated by Radiance's active online community, but a  
mailing list is not always the best or most efficient way to get  
information.  Firstly, the troubled user must understand their  
problem well enough to formulate a coherent question, and English is  
often a second language.  Secondly, the user must be willing to wait  
for an answer.  Sometimes, it comes within hours.  More often, it  
takes a day or two, and sometimes, if their question is poorly worded  
or on an obscure topic, they never get an answer at all.  Even when  
they get an answer, it frequently begins a conversation between two  
or more users that takes a week or so to reach a conclusion.  If you  
are stuck on some problem and facing a deadline, this represents  
precious time lost, and it would be better to spend more time up  
front searching the archives to find an answer without bothering the  
online community, if such an answer exists.

PROPOSAL

We propose to develop an online documentation system for Radiance  
that gathers together all extant information in a tree structure to  
facilitate top-down searches.  At the front page, users will be able  
to perform keyword searches or choose from a small number of  
categories that will narrow their search at each level, drilling down  
until the system either finds a set of relevant materials, or tells  
the user that no information exists, suggesting a topic for a message  
to the radiance-online mailing list.

If the user subsequently composes a question for the mailing list  
with the suggested subject, the thread is followed and the outcome is  
then placed in the documentation tree at the point where the user  
originally reached a dead end.  Online users will be encouraged to  
create a summary or conclusion for each mailing list topic, and  
provide additional links to relevant information for the website.

In this manner, the website will be maintained and updated by the  
user community in a semi-automatic fashion.  A FAQ could also be  
generated automatically based on repeated queries.  This would  
provide new users a place to go before they even know what questions  
to ask.

The basic goal of this project is to gather together existing  
documentation for Radiance, bringing it together in a system that  
permits the user community to continually improve and update the  
content over time.  The facilities developed in this project and the  
lessons learned will have broader application to other LBNL software  
packages with active online communities, such as EnergyPlus and DOE-2 
(??).

RESOURCES

The project will require approximately 6 person-months for a web  
developer to organize the material and create the appropriate pages  
and link together existing and develop new tools for automatic  
updating.  An additional 3 person-months will be required from the  
software's original author, for expert advice on where to find the  
raw material and how best to organize it.  The project timeline will  
allow 6 months from start until the website goes public, followed by  
a 6-month live testing and evaluation period.

Hi Axel. 

Thanks for your effort to collect all the floating wisdom.

Since those are only "keywords" I expect there will be a
lot of them in the long run which could become a problem
because it generates to few or to much hits. Perhaps they
could be organized in a tree-like structure to show the
coverage of the same topic in "higher" levels.

> Here is what I thought:

>     * Patterns
>     * Scripting
>     * Textures
>     * Tutorial

A bit rewritten and adding Greg's and my own new keywords:

     * AddOns
     * HDR
     * Materials
       - Basic Types
       - BRDF
       - Light Sources
       - Patterns
       - Scripting
       - Textures
     * Modelling
       - Generators
       - Export/Import
       - Primitives
     * Reference
       - Basics
       - Commands
       - Methods (for experts)
     * Rendering
       - Tools
       - Parameters
         -- Ambient
     * Scripting
       - Animation
       - Examples
       - Patterns
     * Simulation
       - Artificial
       - Daylighting
         -- Skymodels/Generators
       - Urban Context
     * Tutorial
       - Basic
       - Advanced
       - Best Practices
     * Validation

So if you don't find good information for "Textures" you could
look up sub-keywords of "Materials" and try "Scripting" instead.
Combination of both would be best ("Scripting" in the context of
"Materials").

Subject: [Radiance-dev] [Help] Problem with ximage in 3.7.2
Message-ID: <2AE27CD8C00C3540AF5DCEBE6C3D020B01793120@opecexch1.opec.org>

Greg,

I've finally a clue why [on my SGI FUEL, IRIX 6.5.28, 
MipsPro 7.4.4, VPro12] ximage from Radiance 3.7.2 displays 
my pics color-wise *wrongly* but - on the same machine - 
ximage from Radiance 3.1.11 shows them *correctly*; I found this 
by re-compilation with -DDEBUG.

As it turned out, the two Radiance versions actually choose 
*different* "best" visuals; 3.1.11 selects "TrueColor, depth 24" 
(ximage ok), but 3.7.2 picks "TrueColor, depth 30" (ximage wrong) 
(just compare <viscmp>/x11image.c 3.1.11/3.7.2).

As a test, I explicitely set the visual in 3.1.11 to a 
"TrueColor, depth 30" visual and then ximage displays my pics 
color-wise *wrongly* as well [just like 3.7.2 with its own "best" 
visual does]. Conversely, setting a "TrueColor, depth 24" visual
explicitely in 3.7.2, pics are displayed correctly.
 
So, I think that handling of "TrueColor, depth 30" is *buggy* in 
*both* 3.1.11 and 3.7.2. BTW, "DirectColor, depth 24" doesn't 
display my pics either - I just get a window with black background 
(?) and no image...

For a temporarily by-pass [hopefully only until the next official 
release?], I set the visual in 3.7.2 *explicitely* to a "TrueColor, 
depth 24" visual - and 3.7.2 ximage works fine on my FUEL ...

Only as a side-note, I've changed the printed information in 
<getbestvis>/x11image.c for DEBUG defined to

fprintf(stderr, "Supported visuals:\n");
for (i = 0; i < vismatched; i++)
fprintf(stderr, "index= %d, id 0x%lx (%lud), class %s, depth %d\n",
i, XVisualIDFromVisual(xvi[i].visual),
XVisualIDFromVisual(xvi[i].visual),
vistype[xvi[i].class], xvi[i].depth);

and

fprintf(stderr, "Selected visual: index= %d, id 0x%lx (%lud), class %s, 
depth %d\n",
i, XVisualIDFromVisual(ourvis.visual), 
XVisualIDFromVisual(ourvis.visual),
vistype[ourvis.class], ourvis.depth);

respectively, as I found this a bit more informative for my debugging...

Anyway, thanks for a great piece of software!

Hi all,

does anyone happen to know what the status of the scons build-util is? I
tried to build the most recent head yesterday (with scons) but I get an
error which indicates that some split function in one of the python

Hi folks,

sorry to bother you, but I think we'll have some changes with 
radiance-online in June 2006 :

After running this site for 6 years and going from "guerrilla" state to 
semi-official with 300+ subscribed folks on a stable, back-upped system, 
I feel like I've done my little share and, for various reasons, would 
like to pass on the torch. The domain had been registered (and paid for) 
by me at Network Solutions and will expire* 27. July 2006 *, so you guys 
might want to establish a new way before that date.

Someone would have to locate new hardware and a new provider, or re-use 
other existing servers, as the current server (a 19" rack mount on loan 
from pab-opto) and its location would not be available. Experience with 
Linux based Internet servers (if iptables ring a bell- excellent!), 
Apache, Mailman and CVS are useful.  I'm happy to provide limited 
assistance during the transition, e.g. burn a frozen version of its 
content on CD/DVD, supply details of the current config or ship the 
system disks. There gotta be a few folks out here, among the 90 people 
on the dev list, who fit right in.

The 27. is a fixed date and we have to act rather quickly to
get a new system up and running before that. I have no idea
about the traffic and load of that server but I expect that
a virtual Linux server would do fine for our small group.
I'm not up to date on current offers and service quality of
the providers but others here might have more experience.
 
Peter, can you provide some figures for traffic and the size
of radiance-online.org (GB of available data, size of archive
and CVS)?

I'm happy to volonteer as a sys admin in the long run. But
right now I'm in transition myself and have no private internet
connection. I doubt I can use SSH etc. from my workplace. So for
the immediate future someone else would have to provide some
knowledge and time (I could offer time if someone in London can
offer internet connection ...).

BTW: It would be a good idea to have 3 or 4 people with access
to the system. So emergency response time can be very short even
during holiday season ;)

Hi All,

First off, I want to add to what Thomas said. Thanks for all the hard 
work, Peter! Truly, getting the radiance-online site up and running has 
definitely been one of the critical elements to revitalizing and 
consolidating the Radiance community over these 6 years. We have 
probably all taken for granted the energy and effort to keep the site so 
well maintained over the years. I am sorry for that.

The rest I offer just as a way to help get on the table some of the 
issues that we need to consider. I think there are two critical issues:

   1. domain name transfer - I am not sure about this but I do not think
      that someone can just go and sign up for the domain name, is there
      a process through Network Solutions for Peter to transfer the
      domain name to another party who would pay for and administer the
      domain name?
   2. site content and functionality - would it be worth considering
      some kind of "open source" oriented hosting/project service such
      as sourceforge or ibiblio?

It is not clear to me whether a commercial hosting service (some of 
which can be had quite cheaply) would be able to fulfill the range of 
functionality that the site currently has, perhaps others know more. So 
this would suggest that some kind of co-location solution may be required.

As soon as the current registration expires everyone can in fact
sign up for this domain. That's why we need to do it first and as
soon as possible. If there are any problems in transfering the
domain to another ISP (which should not happen because it's only
bad customer service on the side of one of the providers) I can
ask friends who run a small ISP to help us with this.

I'm not up to date on the offers of SF and alike. What we need now
is basically (and in order of my personal preference):

1) mailing-lists 
2) CVS
3) download of resources (Workshop CDs, etc)
4) news and links about Radiance events

Short of an academic sponsor for this unofficial site I think hosting
is the best way for a reliable and troublefree internet presence. 
My proposal to rent a virtual "root" server is based on the assumption
that in terms of load and size the above list does not justify a "real"
(hardware) server. Virtual servers are cheaper and provide at least
the same level of controll.

I'd like to have a dedicated "machine" for radiance-online.org because
much more than the above is possible and has been discussed and realised
in the past by various individuals. Depending on the dedication and
skill
of the admins we could set up a Wiki, resources repository or CMS
(documentation!) to collect all the small bits of information out there
in one site.

Shall we ask LBNL if they'd be willing to host the site?  The old  
site is a bit dead, and could benefit from a little revitalization.   
Are there arguments for/against having LBNL do it before I ask?

The stats are on the site: http://www.radiance-online.org/webalizer/stats/

For May, 25k pages generated 8GB of traffic

This is quite a bit, and hosting will not be cheap. I reckon at least
300-400 Euros.

I don't know if this is only normal web pages, and how much CVS traffic
there is. For CVS, SF would probably be a good idea.

Altough I'd be happy to offer academic band-width sponsorship, I have to
admit that we don't have the resources (time and hardware) to support
this. Plus on top of this, our network and power are rather unreliable. As
an example: luminance, where webhdr and learnix are hosted, is a K6-II
500MHz. This is as good as it gets.

Having said all that, I would happily dedicate some of my own time setting
up a box and maintaining it. This would require SSH access, though, which
not many hosters are willing to provide these days. It would be much
better if a generous sponsor could bring up a box.

Cheers

Axel

Hi Thomas,

I think that what I mean about the domain name transfer. Is not 
transferring the domain name from one registrar to another this should 
not be an issue. What I was wondering about is rather than wait for 
expiration and re-register the domain, if we could not arrange for a 
more orderly transfer. Actually, I have just gone to my Network 
Solutions account, a preliminary review looks like it is possible to 
request transfer from own party to another, so this may be the best 
mechanism.

I have a friend who is a networking/security consultant, I will ask him 
for recommendations for virtual hosting providers.

Hi Greg,

This sound's like it would a good option to consider. However, if we 
want to have a handful of people who can do some administration, would 
they be able to do it remotely, ie would LBNL allow remote 
access/administration?

Additionally, though it would certainly be a project, this could lead to 
some consolidation of information between the old radsite and 
radiance-online.

We'd have to ask, but I think they'd be OK with remote site  
administration.  I do a lot of my LBNL consulting work via ssh, but  
that doesn't require root access.  Danny Fuller, their IT guy, also  
prefers FreeBSD over Linux, and I'm not sure what issues that might  
cause.

I agree that it would be great to consolidate the old site with  
radiance-online.org.

I am not sure that the flavor of unix should matter that much, so long 
as it does not stand in the way of an easy transition of the site. I 
think probably the first priority needs to be just getting the site 
operational as is. If we can get a resource such as LBNL to host and 
they say FreeBSD, I am not that wedded to Linux. On the other hand 
perhaps more people in the group are familiar with Linux....?
