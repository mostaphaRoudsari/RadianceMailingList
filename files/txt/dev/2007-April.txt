I am still having the same problem with today's head when trying to
compile on Solaris with gcc. The file rt/Version.c contains only the
value, not the variable. char VersionID[]=" is simply missing. I am
editing the file by hand now, but this is a bug in Solaris builds.

CU Lars.

Hi Lars,

I don't have access to a Solaris system, so without any further  
hints, I haven't much hope of fixing the problem...

$ cat src/rt/Version.c
/*
 * This file was created automatically during make.
 */

char VersionID[]="RADIANCE 3.8 lastmod Monday April 16 09:26:50 BST 2007 
by james on gyor";

$ uname -a
SunOS gyor 5.8 Generic_117350-38 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-60


"today's head", whatever that really means, is the same as "yesterday's"
going by the file time stamps.

Hm, that is really strange. I use the "makeall install" script, and add 
an CC=gcc to the Makefile. That is all I modified. Do you use GCC or Sun 
C? I am aware that just changing the compiler may break certain things. 
Maybe I have to workout in detail the settings required for compiling 
radiance on Solaris by GCC? Seams that the Version.c problem is the 
result of something else, will have a closer look at this tonight.

CU Lars.

Sun cc

$ cc -V
cc: Sun C 5.8 Patch 121015-04 2007/01/10
usage: cc [ options] files.  Use 'cc -flags' for details

Version.c comes from simple scripting in the makefile and not the
compiler:

$ gzcat ${SRC}/radiance/radiance-HEAD.tgz | tar xf -
$ cd ray/src/rt
$ make -f Rmakefile Version.c
( cat VERSION ; date ; whoami ; hostname ) > Version.c
ed - Version.c < verscript.ed
$ cat Version.c
/*
 * This file was created automatically during make.
 */

char VersionID[]="RADIANCE 3.8 lastmod Monday April 16 12:17:48 BST 2007 
by james on gyor";
