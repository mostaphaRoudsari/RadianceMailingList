Subject: [Radiance-dev] rpiece improper input?
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0708220938560.8117@rygar.gpcc.itd.umich.edu>

I found what might be a prevantable error in rpiece that occurs 
when the number of rows in the rpiece array exceeds the number of 
pixels in the image. I ran

----------
#!/bin/sh

[ -z "$NCPU" ] && NCPU=2
[ -z "$COLS" ] && COLS=1
[ -z "$ROWS" ] && ROWS=2560

echo $COLS $ROWS > syncfile
rm -f pp

while [ "$NCPU" -gt 0 ]
do
         echo "running proc $NCPU"
         rpiece -v -PP pp -F syncfile @vp_sunrise @opts -t 60 -x 1280 -y 1280 -o img09.pic scene10.oct &
         NCPU=`expr $NCPU - 1`
done
wait

rm -f syncfile pp

exit 0
----------

and it emitted the following proper error in my nohup.out file:

----------
running proc 2
running proc 1
rpiece: requested piece (59,2559) out of range
FRAME 1: -vtv -vp 0 0 0 -vd 0 0 1 -vu -1 0 0 -vh 170 -vv 0.511632

which is fine, but it also dumped this to the stdout:

*** glibc detected *** double free or corruption (!prev):

Here are the stats:

Is this anything to worry about? Normally when I see an error 
like that, something weird had happened in the compilation.

(Normally, I also code in fortran. Take that as you will.)

Hi Mark,

I added some error-checking to rpiece.c, which you can download from  
radiance-online:

	http://www.radiance-online.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/ray/src/util/ 
rpiece.c

Let me know if this fixes the problem.

Greg,

I put the code in, and did a "rmake rpiece" in the src/util 
directory, but when I do

/usr/local/ray/src/util/rpiece -v -PP ppp -F syncfiletest 
@vp_sunrise @opts -t 600 -x 1280 -y 1280 -o imgtest.pic 
scene10.oct

with syncfiletest containing "1 2560" I get a "Segmentation 
fault". I am rebuilding the whole package from HEAD (with the 
rpiece change) now to see if that makes any difference.

Sorry!  There was a bug in my bug fix -- try it again.

Done and working as expected. No ancilliary errors.
