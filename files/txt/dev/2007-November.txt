Sorry for my late reply, but I'm missing a bit free time for packaging
work these days.

Creating an extra bin path is not a problem, but this makes things
unnecessarily confusing for new Radiance users. If you'd like to see the
Radiance community grow (which is one of the reasons why I've started to
work on a package for Debian - Radiance is too good to hide it somewhere
in a small, closed community), things should be as easy as possible.
This includes binaries in $PATH and their manpages within the manpath.
I've rarely seen a program which comes with such a good documentation in
form of manpages, it would be a shame to hide them, just because we move
all tools into a non-public path.

For those people who add an extra path to their PATH anyway:
What about creating a directory which contains the compatibility
symlinks, so you can add this directory to your PATH?
Like a directory /usr/lib/radiance/compat, with the following synlinks
as contens:

bin/genbox -> /usr/bin/genrbox
bin/rview  -> /usr/bin/rvu
share/man/man1/genbox.1.gz -> /usr/share/man/man1/genrbox.1.gz
share/man/man1/rview.1.gz -> /usr/share/man/man1/rvu.1.gz

This would also allow you to add /usr/lib/radiance/compat/share/man to
the manpath to have the manpages available. And new users are able to
use genrbox/rvu without any extra hassle.


Would this solve the problem?


Also I'd like to know if there're other wishes regarding the Dbeian
package, if so, I'd like to change things now before it needs to be done
in a hurry later, and before more new users get used to the current
structure.


Best regards,

Bernd

No, although this would be the most easiest way to solve this, it is not
allowed and would be a policy violation:

IMHO this is the best solution proposed so far, and perhaps the
Debian post-install script could ask the user whether he wants to
add the "compatibility" paths ...

About other wishes, it would be nice to add 3ds2mgf from the source
package (it is in /ray/src/cv/mgflib), or external programmes like
gendaylit (http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/pub/generators/index.html).

Thanks again to Bernd and Greg for making this happen :-)

Have you considered using the modules package for path management.  
Using modules with one command you can switch your path (or most any  
part of your environment) form one thing to another and then back.

A lot of existing scene files won't work without the additional  
directory in the path, and I think that new users are going to get  
discouraged very quickly by that.  Perhaps the thing to do is to have  
"rad" add your links directory to the PATH it uses when it invokes  
oconv.

There are dozens of Radiance programs that load or decode scene  
files, so adding the necessary path to all of them is going to  
involve a whole lot of code changes.

Sorry, you've lost me there. I think the point of creating a separate
path is to keep the established names while we're still able to have
everything related to Radiance in one (less common) place.

$PATH can be extended and $MANPATH can be extended.

A separate path is not 'hiding' anything. In fact this seems to be the
most Unix/Radiance-like way of solving the problem

> share/man/man1/rview.1.gz -> /usr/share/man/man1/rvu.1.gz

This implies that we do rename 'genbox' which is not necessary if there
is a separate path. And if we end up creating a 'compat' directory it
should not contain links to the real man page but a man page that  
informs
the user about the name change and advises to use the new name instead.
The binary links are necessary for existing scripts but I'm not sure if
'rview' is still necessary. It's interactive after all so everyone who
uses the wrong binary is presented with an error message as a reminder.


To come to an end: I don't thing there is a big problem with existing
scenes/scripts breaking due to the renaming of 'genbox'. I don't think
there is a big sharing of scene files going on so everyone who's new to
Radiance will write their own scenes and hopefully get a set of updated
documents to assist them. The bundled examples should be easy to update,
just as the various scripts out there (like my own). The source  
distribution
can create a link in the standard Radiance bin/ directory and expect the
users/admins to extend the path if necessary, Debian can moves these
links to another place and only hack $PATH if compatibility is desired.

We will get a few more mails to the list but as the 'rvu' experience  
shows
it's nothing we couldn't handle. All in all it seems not such a big  
problem
whatever we do.

Regards,
Thomas

If it's added to rad, though, and the programs rad invokes inherit  
it, at least basic scene files will work with the most common  
rendering program.  It's not a perfect fix (I don't think we're going  
to find one) but it will at least get new users over the initial hump.

No need for that, I can just drop it into the package, symlinks don't
take much space, so that's not a problem at all.

I'll build that with the next upload. Seems it's not included in the
Rmakefile and I forgot about it. I think Greg could add this to the

If you convince the authors to put them under a free license, this is
not a problem at all. I've only looked at gendaylit, but it's license it
not free according to the Debian Free Software Guidelines.

 * Don't even think of selling this software to other people, or
 * distributing it commercially, that is strict and explicit no.

Worst piece in there, didn't read the rest carefully.


Some days ago I was pointed to a lot of documentation which is shipped
with Learnix (if I remember right). It would probably be interesting to
ship that with Debian, too (if the License permits to do so). If the
Learnix people are reading here - I'd be happy if we could work
something out (if I don't get any reaction I'll find an email addy and
write directly).

An other interesting option would be to provide FAI
(http://www.informatik.uni-koeln.de/fai/) installers to install Radiance
on clusters - if anybody has a use for this.


Also I'd like to announce the availability of Radiance in my blog -
which is on planet.debian.org - as soon as the packaging seems to be
stable enough. If anybody knows a good summary about radiance, which I'd
be allowed to share (with proper reference of course) - please point me
to it.

Adding the Radiance compatibility path, directory, and links should be the default behavior and should ask the user if he/she would like NOT to install the compatibility path add-on...only if the system currently has a "genbox" and "rview" namespace conflict.  That way the default configuration includes everything needed and only with user interaction could the installation fail to produce a working installation.

 * Don't even think of selling this software to other people, or
 * distributing it commercially, that is strict and explicit no.

Worst piece in there, didn't read the rest carefully.


Some days ago I was pointed to a lot of documentation which is shipped
with Learnix (if I remember right). It would probably be interesting to
ship that with Debian, too (if the License permits to do so). If the
Learnix people are reading here - I'd be happy if we could work
something out (if I don't get any reaction I'll find an email addy and
write directly).

An other interesting option would be to provide FAI
(http://www.informatik.uni-koeln.de/fai/) installers to install
 Radiance
on clusters - if anybody has a use for this.


Also I'd like to announce the availability of Radiance in my blog -
which is on planet.debian.org - as soon as the packaging seems to be
stable enough. If anybody knows a good summary about radiance, which
 I'd
be allowed to share (with proper reference of course) - please point me
to it.


Best regards,

Bernd

you're missing something here.
The compat links won't reside in /usr/bin. So there's no need to remove
them at all.

If you need me or would like me to make changes to the makeall  
script, let me know.  Otherwise, I'll assume you can do this on the  
packaging side.

I added it and checked in the change so 3ds2mgf will be built by  
default in the future.

I'm not using makeall at all as it is not really useful for me.
http://svn.recluse.de/filedetails.php?repname=debian&path=%2Ftrunk%2Fpackages%2Fradiance%2Fdebian%2Frules&rev=0&sc=0
is the debian/rules file if anybody is interested to have a look.

I'll try to find some time during the next days to update the package.
Probably won't happen before the weekend, though.

Hi Bernd,

It was my understanding that the proposal was to modify the users $PATH varrible to include the /usr/radiance/compat/whatever  path.  This means Greg doesn't have to re-write all of his code and makes it possible that a rview/genbox namespace conflict may arise.

(Allow me to break my self-imposed curfew for a short moment)

I can really only agree with Thomas here, even if he didn't put
it quite that bluntly:

Installing a package with more than 100 executables in everybodys
/usr/bin/ is one of the most unpleasant things you can do in this
context. The standards offer the alternative of /usr/lib/<package>
exactly for this case. Adding two extra paths in an user's
environment is a trivial exercise. Remember that your target
audience are Linux users, who do this all the time.
Those people who would fail, just because they don't know how
to edit their ~/.profile or ~/.cshrc, will not be able to do
anything useful with Radiance anyway. Don't make life miserable
for the knowledgeable users because of them.

Renaming genbox, with all the contreived workarounds that have
been proposed, would only solve *our* problem *for now*. But
because we'd occupy such a large portion of the namespace in
/usr/bin/, installing there would inevitably cause more problems
for other package authors in the future. The problems it would
cause for Radiance users right now have already been mentioned.

In summary: Clogging /usr/bin/ is very bad manners. Don't do it.

It's not the first and not the last package which brings a lot of
binaries. The only difference is that other large packages try to make
it obvious where a binary belongs to, for example by adding an
appropriate prefix. Which is something I wish for all coming additions
to radiance - please choose an appropriate name, for example rad-foo
instead of foo.

> The standards offer the alternative of /usr/lib/<package>
> exactly for this case.

Right, for programs which are usually not executed by the normal user.
Splitting them doesn't sound like an easy task on the first look, but it
should be possible. But this would also include that all tools know
about the extra path without messing with $PATH.

> Adding two extra paths in an user's

Oh? I haven't touched $PATH for years now, and I wouldn't know any
reason why I should do so. Binaries which are supposed to be executed by
a user go into /usr/bin (or /usr/local/bin, if they're not installed by
a package). To cite the FHS:
/usr/lib includes object files, libraries, and internal binaries that
are NOT intended to be executed directly by users or shell scripts.

And I'm not going to violate that because somebody prefers to hide
Radiance to make it even harder to use than necessary.

Bad enough, this sounds more like something to fix in Radiance. But yes,
I guess people who're able to write a makefile should be able to set
something like RAYPATH somewhere in their environment.

> Don't make life miserable
> for the knowledgeable users because of them.

If you're knowledgeable AND set extra PATHs anyway, it shouldn't be a
problem to set your PATH to a directory where compatibility links are
located (you should even be able to use sed!). Also this is exactly the
damn opinion why a LOT of open source tools are not usable for beginners
- they're only used by 'knowledgeable' people, why the hell should we
make things simple non people with less knowledge? Why add
documentations at all (this does NOT go against radiance - I'm amazed by
the detailed documentation, thanks Greg!)? And so on. If you prefer that
open source software stays something which is usable for knowledgeable
people only, please go and hide in your cave, take the source and
compile it to /yes/I/am/TEH/BRAIN/and/I/have/to/prove/it - you're free
to do so.

A name clash may happen always. For most tools from radiance I don't see
a high chance that this will happen, although there're a few with very
short names which are prone to such problems obviously. But as Debian is
the largest (or one of the largest) distributions, and we had only two
name clashes, I don't see a big problem here. If you'd install _all_
packages (including those in non-free, and packages you can't install at
the same time, and including unofficial repositories like
debian-multimedia), you'd have
0 bzed@hal:~$ apt-file search /usr/bin | wc -l
39033
files in /usr/bin. Feel free to create theories about the probability of
another name clash while looking at the time it took to get those 39033
files into /usr/bin.


> (back into my cave again)

Good idea.


If you prefer to have a growing community Radiance must be attractive
for new users, and as easy to use as possible. With the given examples
and what is shipped in the radiance-materials package a not too dumb
student should be able to create something based on that, which
is/should (imho) at least be enough for an instructional curse.

Something I also thought about was to create a webpage which allows
people to upload photos of materials and the MacBeth chart, so at least
a big enough material base would exist for people (like students/....)
who're interested in learning to use radiance, and who like to have a
nice rendering at the end, but who don't need exact results at the end.
Unfortunately I doubt I have time for that soon.


Best regards,

Bernd

I have to correct myself here - my apt-file lists some files more than
once...
0 bzed@hal:~$  apt-file search /usr/bin | sort -u | wc -l
20315

Still an impressive number.

Also while looking at the list, most packages which come with a lot of
programs use prefixes for their tools, bioperl uses bp_ for example (no,
I'm not suggesting to rename all radiance programs).


Cheers,

Bernd

Hi Bernd,

This e-mail must have caught you at a bad time -- I would consider it  
a favor if you keep a civil tone with others on this list.  Schorsch  
(Georg Mischler) is one of the principal contributors to Radiance,  
and the only other person besides myself who does regular work on the  
CVS tree.  Virtually all of his time is donated, so bear in mind that  
you are speaking with a fellow volunteer and collaborator.   
Regardless of rank and ability, no one deserves to be ridiculed in  
public for comments made, especially earnest and well-considered  
ones.  In general, I ask that posters treat each other with respect  
and listen to one another's opinions, even if they disagree.  Enough  
said.

I am not a Linux user, so I don't really consider this my problem,  
but if I were to install Radiance on a machine I managed (which I  
think I've done once or twice), I would prefer to have the binaries  
in their own separate directory as Schorsch suggests, similar to /usr/ 
X11R6/bin and /usr/local/pbm.  On my machine, Radiance sits in /usr/ 
local/ray, even though the default build script drops them in /usr/ 
local/bin.  I actually thought separate package directories was the  
norm, but you know more about Linux conventions and Debian packages  
than anyone else I know, so I trust in your authority.  However, I am  
interested to hear what others have to say on this point.  I don't  
think you want to receive complaints about crowding /usr/bin and  
causing name conflicts any more than I do.

As for naming all future Radiance programs rad-this or rad-that, it  
just isn't going to happen.  The number of programs being added is  
fewer than one per year, and what kind of sense does it make 10 years  
down the line to have 10 of 100 programs start with rad-* and the  
rest sans prefix?  Renaming everything in a go would cause dozens of  
compatibility issues like the genbox problem we've discussed ad  
nauseam, so I don't really see this as a viable solution.

Is it possible to offer a different installation directory at least  
as an option?

Hi Greg,

Not a too bad time, but I'm a kinda annoyed by people who suggest to
make the use of software more complicated for the common user because
they know all about it. I'm sorry for the rant.

This was removed for a good reason.
For compatibility /usr/bin/X11 is a link to /usr/bin, and /usr/X11R6/bin
is a link to /usr/bin, too.

Definitely not, I'm more than interested to hear opinions about the way
to handle this, too. Although I'd just keep it as it is for the moment -
the chance that we have a name clash before Lenny is pretty low imho.
Also in most cases I have the better arguments (use in
clusters/scripts/existing stuff/....) - but not against a suite which
works similar to radiance, is in Debian since a _long_ time and has >
280 popcon reports. Although their maintainer offered to rename it, it
didn't take long until the first users yelled at him. It is only sane to
leave genbox to them. gromacs ships with 85 files in /usr/bin for
example - so having 123 files in /usr/bin is not a problem, definitely.

If you look at the popcon stats, radiance is rising more and more and I
hope this keeps going, so we have a good argument not to rename anything.

The other problem which would be introduced by moving stuff away would
be the manpages, they couldn't be installed into section 1 anymore, so
this would be extra work to change the section and move them accordingly.

The only way I can see is if we're able to distinguish between programs
which are used by other programs only, and not by user _scripts_ (as in
csh/bash/..., which relies on $PATH), they could be installed in a
different directory. Installing tools, which are used by a normal user,
into a different directory then /usr/bin would be a violation of the FHS.

> As for naming all future Radiance programs rad-this or rad-that, it just

No need to call them rad-foo, but for example instead of cv call a
program metacv or metaconv. This rises the chance that somebody else
uses a different name. For example brl-cad ships a cv binary, too, and
looking at http://lists.debian.org/debian-changes/2000/01/msg00006.html
it seems we had a /usr/bin/cv some long time ago in the xa+cv package.
Also googling for /usr/bin/intendedprogramname helps.

I still think even if we'd have to rename another tool (I'll try to
avoid that, bu you can't know) everybody who doesn't want to follow such
a name change is able to use the suggested compat directory. Adding
something to PATH in general or adding it only if you want to use the
original names doesn't make a bit difference imho. Please note that I
can't add directories to $PATH automatically, it's always something that
needs to be done by the user/admin.

No, renaming all tools doesn't make any sens at all and I'd never
suggest that.

Not if you use packages.

Hi Bernd,

Thanks for your reply.  I guess I'm hopelessly behind the times when  
it comes to how things are managed on Linux.  I know FreeBSD/Darwin  
still uses the old separate bin directories approach for tool sets.   
Whether it causes problems, I'm not aware.

As for renaming "cv," I don't think that would be a problem since  
hardly anyone uses it.  If you have other specific programs you think  
need renaming, let me know, and I'll make the changes if I can.

Do you distribute a removal script with your package as well, in case  
someone decides to uninstall Radiance?  Just curious.

-Greg

Hi Bernd,

I was just poking around a bit and I wonder about using 
/etc/alternatives to manage the conflict between the two versions of 
xform? So perhaps there could be /usr/bin/rgenbox for radiance and 
/usr/bin/ggenbox for gromacs which then get resolved by 
/etc/alternatives/genbox? This /etc/alternatives is new to me so I am 
not clear if I am thinking about this the right way.

Either the BSD or the Linux guys like to make things different... :)
And Apple completes the chaos by using FreeBSD, adding Aqua, adding an
extra X11 and merging code from SUN :)

I'd just leave it as it is until somebody complains. I've asked Lars if
he'd be interested to package brl-cad, but he said that they'd probably
not have a problem at all to rename it.
I think brl-cad would be a good addition, I hope they find the time to
get a really good gui on top of it.

Anyway I'll add the compat directory with the next upload, so people can
add it to PATH and MANPATH if they want to and get the old environment back.

> Do you distribute a removal script with your package as well, in case

Well, it's a package, so you remove it like every package - using your
favorite package manager. You probably know rpm from redhat and co -
Debian is using a different (times better imho) package manager called
dpkg. There're several frontends to dpkg which handle the
retrieval/upgrade/.... of packages and tell dpkg to install/remove/...
them. Most of them are based on apt, like apt-get.
So to install radiance you run
apt-get install radiance radiance-doc radiance-materials
(if you want all packages....; there's also radiance-sse3 with optimized
binaries for modern x86_64 CPUs running a 32bit environment)
To remove radiance you could run - for example:
apt-get remove radiance radiance-doc radiance-materials

As usual there're also several ways to do this, but all of them will end
by telling dpkg to remove the packages or to purge them (a remove keeps
config files of a package, purge removes everything).

I think a look into a random Debian for beginners howto will show you
all details of the Debian package management. If you're interested just
ask, I can find a good book about Debian for you.


Cheers,

Bernd

The idea is good, and indeed alternatives are way to handle such
conflicts, BUT this is only allowed in the case that both programs
provide the same features. For example /usr/bin/x-www-browser is managed
by alternatives and is used as default web browser in the system, you
can use update-alternatives to select konqueror/iceweasel/....... to
provide it.
Same thing for diversions using dpkg-divert - it's only allowed if both
programs are able to replace each other. For example did gpsdrive ship
it's own version of gpsd for some time, and while installing the
original gpsd a diversion was added so /usr/bin/gpsd was provided from
the gpsd package.
genbox from Gromacs and genbox from Radiance have completely different
functions, so using diversions or alternatives on them is forbidden by
policy.

Imagine you'd accidentally have the genbox from gromacs instead of the
Radiance genbox because you've messed with the alternatives, and it
would provide some output which looks sane to the rest of Radiance -
you'd end up with something completely different then expected.
That's not a huge problem here, but imagine such a confusion would
happen with some destructive tool. That's why Debian's policy says:
Binaries MUST have a unique name, and alternatives/diversions are only
allowed if the programs are exchangeable without any problems for the user.


Hope that explains it :)

Bernd

Hi,

being not a developer, I still want to comment on this.

Radiance has always attracted a special kind of conflicts. It was meant 
to be a program for experts, giving reliable results for simulations. So 
in many cases, it will be installed on a dedicated machine and used by a 
"dedicated user", too - someone who is using it as a professional, 
knowing all the tricks, embedding it into his scripts, workflow 
whatever, and compling it to

/simulation/light/radiance/snapshots/3.4_withBackPorts/sse3

;-) And it is perfectly working.

On the other hand, there have always been people who did unexpected 
things with Radiance, even using it only to produce nice imagines, some 
in their spare time. And the great thing about the Radiance community is 
that they all communicate, noone is blaming the other.

Now in Linux world, a lot is about cleaning up Unix traditions that were 
locking out users. The file hierarchy standard is one, the use of 
package managers another (maybe not important for those who compile once 
- but after the third update, you will apreciate the simple automatic 
update procedure). And thus, it IS important not to invent special 
directory hierarchies for every single application.

I know that there are approaches to keep packages in their own 
directory. I did so, because I often have different releases installed 
at the same system. But for a managed system, this does not make much 
sense. And even those systems having dedicated directory trees for 
packages are not really coherent - you will still find lots of 
applications in /usr/bin, there is some black magic deciding what is 
suitable for an own dir and what is not. I think it is confusing at least.

Now, I really do not see any disadvantage of renaming genbox, putting it 
into /usr/bin, and having an option (not default) to set a compatibility 
link. It would result in a cleaner setup for new users (which are the 
ones I expect to use the package most). For those who have !genbox in 
their scenes, it won't be a problem to press "Y" - they are usually 
experienced users anyway, able to edit their PATH as needed, maybe still 
prefering to compile from source (so not affected at all). So I do not 
see a real scenario where this clean-up would cause a problem.

And of course, we should not start ranting here, the community is too 
small and to precious to step on each other's feet. Schorsch has been 
both a developer and a very helpful person for people who needed help 
and asked in the community, and he certainly has a lot of real 
experience with Radiance, also as he is one of those who embedded it in 
a commercial system which is a real great working environment for 
professional users imho. Bernd is from a very different background, he 
is one of those who try to make Linux useable for the non-experts, which 
is a lot about not focussing on one app but the whole system. And I 
think we really need both here...

Ok, enough, have a nice day out there and go on with great work,

Lars.

Because unless the campatability link is installed, a large number of  
existing scenes won't render, and none of the docs will tell you  
why.  Can you imagine something more frustrating to a new user?

But that is what I am wondering. The new user does not have existing 
scenes. And it is trivial to change the scenes that are distributed, as 
there are actually few scenes available for download, most from the 
radiance ftp-server, where a few sed's would solve all the issue.

The real worry I could understand is that things are documented in RwR 
which is not so easy to update. But that is also true for all changes of 
Radiance including new features.

They're patched if you look into the package.

At least those changes, including the rename of rview to rvu, are
documented in /usr/share/doc/radiance/README.Debian, which is the
appropriate place for such a documentation.

And all the docs are wrong now, including the only published

There's no need to rename genbox in radiance, doing so for the Debian
package is enough. Radiance is neither the first nor the last program
which is hit by such a problem, netatalk is another prominent example,
and there're more.

As I mentioned, I take the documentation problem more serious then the 
PATH and script questions. But actually, to prevent this, you would have 
to "freeze" Radiance forever. A lot of things changed since the first 
printed "RwR", and as I have a copy I bought some years ago, I have to 
live with the fact that there is no obj2mesh, another animation system, 
rvu instead of rview, ...... it's like that for all software that is 
maintained.

The email archives will reflect the changes (such as they already 
contain this discussion). The example scenes can be updated. The problem 
is the book. So here, one could create a set of pages with changes, 
corrections and updates to distribute as pdf. People may print out than 
and add it to the end of their copy of RwR. Would be reasonable with or 
without renaming.

I am against Bernd's proposal of changing the name only in Debian. 
Support on the list would be hell, a bit like anwering the 
Desktop-Radiance users' question while noone of those answering has an 
installation of the modified software. And if we reference to the 
cabin-scene, it should be THE cabin, not the Debian-, the classic- or 
maybe one's Special-scene...

That was not meant as a proposal. More like: I have to change it to be
able to get the program integrated into a distribution, you can follow
that if you want to, or not. I (as a package maintainer) can't expect
upstream to follow such changes, if they do so it's good, if not, it's
something I have to live with, which includes keeping the appropriate
patches updated for ever. Adding a documentation about the change and
probably helping out users if they come with questions or bug reports
resulting from it is something I have to do anyway.
Package maintainers can't force their upstreams to do things, all they
can do is to send their wishes and suggestions to upstream. Working
together on such problems is the optimal case, unfortunately not all
upstream's are as responsive as Greg is, some very prominent examples
even refuse to keep contact at all...

I could easily follow the method I used for the rview -> rvu change,  
which is to install a symbolic link for compatibility in the install  
directory (genbox -> genrbox).  Bernd would put this link in the  
special directory, and genbox would become genrbox.  The manual page  
wouldn't necessarily be linked, since genrbox would be the new,  
official name.  Old scene files would still work on all installations  
done with makeall, and the Debian package would only require setting  
the PATH variable to make sure it works.  Following this solution  
seems quite reasonable to me, and I'm grateful that it's only one  
generator/program that's been hit by this (so far).  It would be much  
worse if xform had to be renamed, and that's a pretty generic name --  
we got off lucky.

Good idea, so let's stick with that.

You obviously do (or did) not know who I am, so it should not
damage your ego too much to apologize for your rudeness.


I don't care if /usr/lib/<package> is really the right place
(that's your job to figure out, what eg. about /opt/?).
But placing very specialized packages with lots of executables
and support data into one system-central bin directory simply
doesn't work for everybody and everything. I have a hard time
believing that this is the only way provided by Debian.

Among other reasons, it only would make sense for people who
don't care which version they are using, which is relatively rare
with Radiance. Those who actually work with this stuff will
easily have several different versions on their system for
various purposes. An install procedure that does its job right
would take care of that as well.

We renamed rview to rvu, because as an interactive application it
doesn't appear in scene descriptions and because conflicting with
gvim is a really bad thing to do (even if we used the name first).
But renaming genbox because of another obscure and specialized
package doesn't make sense, and would lead us on a very slippery
slope.

In my opinion, a Debian default install is not sufficient
justification to break scene descriptions. If you can't make it
work with the existing executable names, then so be it. And if
you force people to set a path to some "compatibility directory",
then you can just as well store all the binaries there.


Alternatively, *if* we start renaming executables, then we should
do a complete overhaul (eg. with release 4.0), so that after that
*all* names will be reasonably unique. There are several
possible ways to make this largely transparent, so that Radiance
would still accept the old names internally, and transpose them
to the new ones. Not fool proof for all situations, but a
possible way to soften the blow to the users. But let's not drag
things out unnecessarily by renaming two or three items every few
months, which is bound to happen if we start with just genbox
now.

I already did that, but if it's better for your ego I'll repeat it: I'm
sorry for the rant. People who ask me to make the life for newcomers
harder than absolutely necessary just because they're knowledgeable
can't expect any respect from me. You didn't come to this world as
expert, so please don't make it harder for other people to become as
good as you are.

Please send your complaints to the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard Group,
neither to me nor to Debian.

It's not the job of a distribution to take care for specialized
installations. That's why you can download the source using your
favorite package management tool and recompile it. Then you're also free
to install to /usr/local or /opt.

This would probably not be bad for the future, especially as you don't
know when there'll be some really important tool with the same or
similar name as a radiance binary. Git (GNU Interactive Tools) is a
prominent example here, since Linus decided to use git as name for his
VCS. But I can't see any reason to have an extra hurry here.

Not sure how you figured these numbers out and why this should happen,
but I've explained that often enough now.
There's no need for anybody to rename genbox now, except for the Debian
package. Let Radiance stay in Debian and see what's happening, nobody
forces you to use it.

If you're talking about modifying the source to get a different version
for different things - that's also not my job. If there's a need to add
specialized programs there should be a development package, which
provides the necessary headers and (statically linked) libraries. Moving
the most common (and not changing) functions into a shared library would
also be an idea for the future. It doesn't make sense to recompile the
whole package if you need an additional tool for one project, or if you
need to change one function.

Hi...

>>> for new users, and as easy to use as possible.

Actually, afaik Radiance does not need to care so much about a growing 
community. Everyone in light sim is coming to Radiance sooner or later 
anyhow, as fas as not in need for a simple point-and-click-tool for the 
most basic tasks. Still it would leverage the job of people giving 
support, university lab admins, and also developers of 3rd party tools, 
to have a package. E.g. installing the Blender frontend for Radiance 
would automatically ask me to install the Blender and Radiance packages, 
download and configure. And all these packages could be updated without 
any trouble using package management.

Bernd, Schorsch can expect respect because he has contributed a lot to 
development, and he is certainly one of those who have worked hard to 
make beginners' lifes less hard by giving detailed help to people like 
me. He has another concept of software distribution, that's all.

>> I don't care if /usr/lib/<package> is really the right place
>> (that's your job to figure out, what eg. about /opt/?).

The problem is to distinguish between distribution packages and 
additional software. If software is part of the distribution, name 
conflicts have to be avoided. It is perfectly well to have all in 
/usr/bin than. If you install additional, isolated software (such as the 
three self-compiled Radiance installs in my /opt), this is perfectly ok 
- but not touched by the package manager.

>> But placing very specialized packages with lots of executables

It works for all the software in Debian. As said, if you need something 
not contained in the distro, you can still compile it into /opt, your 
home etc.

>> Among other reasons, it only would make sense for people who

I think the typical user case for a Debian package is having the most 
recent release. This will work in hundreds of installations. You would 
still compile your own - you would simply not use the package.

>> various purposes. An install procedure that does its job right
>> would take care of that as well.

No, it is not necessary to have all releases of the software in all 
releases of the distro. The distro of 2007 will in most cases contain 
packages based on software releases of 2007 with only bug-fixes added later.

It is important here to understand the difference between buying an OS 
and installing software, or choosing a distribution which is a 
compilation of both OS and applications.

CU Lars.

That's probably not 100% true, I've met a guy at the FROSCOM who told me
that they were (or are?) working on a lightning simulation program for a
thesis as there wouldn't be any tool for that available. He was looking
a bit confused when I told him about radiance. Even on irc people asked
me about it because they didn't hear about radiance before. So I think
the publicity can be improved pretty much - or googling skills of people....

Another sign that Radiance continues to be popular is that the sales of Rendering with Radiance have gone up dramatically (4x) this past month.  Perhaps this is because the book is now available at Amazon.com with quick-ship.  It says there are 5 books in stock that can be delivered by Nov. 12th.

Probably the 4 other people (plus me) which are using the Debian package
of radiance according to popcon:

http://people.debian.org/~igloo/popcon-graphs/index.php?packages=radiance&show_installed=on&show_vote=on&show_old=on&show_recent=on&show_nofiles=on&want_legend=on&want_ticks=on&from_date=2007-09-01&to_date=2007-11-08&hlght_date=&date_fmt=%25Y-%25m&beenhere=1

Also are 40 installations not a bad rate for a new package which was not
really advertised except with a one-liner in my blog. I still need to
prepare a longer article about Radiance, planet.debian.org is read by a
few people...

Message-ID: <47435DCF.4010808@bzed.de>

Heya,

this mail goes to several upstreams/devel lists of packages I maintain
in Debian, so please excuse if it sounds impersonal.

On Thursday, December 13th Ubuntu will have their 'Debian Import Freeze'
[1] for Hardy, their upcoming release.

If you'd like to see any changes in the current Debian package before it
is frozen in Ubuntu it needs to be uploaded to Debian _before_ December
3rd to make sure it'll have 10 days to migrate to Debian/testing. As
migrating often takes longer than 10 days, it should be uploaded as soon
as possible.
So if you have something that should go into Ubuntu Hardy, please
contact me as soon as possible.


Thanks & cheers,

Bernd
