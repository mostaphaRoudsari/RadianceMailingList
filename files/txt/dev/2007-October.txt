Hi Axel,

it works great! The only thing I'd like to propose is to make an own 
search option for the mailing lists' archives. For every term you get 
ml-posts on the first hits. Something like google's group search may be 
appropriate for this to distinguish between ml and web ressources. A 
simple exclude of the mailing lists' archives would be fine for the web 
search, an exclusive search in the archive pages for mailing list search 
would complete that. So what I would like to see is two tabs - one for 
the list, one for web ressources and the rest.

Thank You!!!

Lars.

You want it? You got it! I also added an option for file types. Only
on the front page for now.

Would be easy enough, but this functionality is already implemented on r-o.org

Let's just call it 'options', not 'tabs'.

Message-ID: <47081092.1070404@bzed.de>

Hi list,

I'm happy to announce that Radiance was accepted in Debian's unstable on
Thursday, it'll be shipped with the next release which is called Lenny.

My thanks go to Gregory J. Ward for replying to all my emails and taking
care of all problems I run into.

At the moment Debian's version is '3R8+20070924.dfsg' - which mainly
means it is the CVS HEAD from 2007-09-24. Unfortunately I had to remove
some pdf files which are in the Radiance distribution without sources,
therefore the .dfsg was added to the version - but I'm sure Gregory and
me will find a way around that, too.

The following packages are shipped in Debian:

* radiance - containing the binaries and manpages
* radiance-doc - containing all other documentation and the examples
* radiance-materials - all material files
* radiance-sse3 - SSE3 optimized versions of the renderers, this package
is only available on i386, the amd64 binaries are automatically
optimized for SSE4 (if I remember right, man gcc tells more ;))

The overview in the package tracing system can be found at [1].

/usr/share/radiace/doc/README.Debian provides additional details, it can
 also be read online at [2]

If the pacakges are not available on your favourite platform yet,
they're probably just not built yet - some buildds seem to lag a bit
behind - [3]. Please try again later :)

I'd be happy about any kind of feedback, especially before Lenny will be
released - which will take some more months for sure, but as soon as it
is released, there's no way to fix minor bugs anymore.

Also - if there's any interest - I'll make sure there will be backports
for Etch available as soon as the package migrates from unstable to testing.

If there's any interest I can also build and provide a Debian live cd
with radiance pre-installed.

For developers are probably the build logs interesting - they're
provided at [4]. Patches I've added to build under Debian are listed at
[5]. Mainly they remove the shipped libtiff in favor for Debian's
libtiff and fix several implicit declarations, which are known to result
in problems on several of Debian's architectures.

Feel free to ask if you have any questions regarding the packages or Debian.


Best regards,

Bernd Zeimetz

Hi Bernd,

I'm moving this discussion to radiance-dev, since that's where it  
really belongs.  (Feel free to subscribe if you aren't.)

Having compatibility links as an option during installation is fine  
with me if it defaults to "yes" or provides a clear explanation of  
the pitfalls of not installing the links.  I guess we only need a  
link for genbox at this point, though I would like to keep "rview" in  
there as well for consistency with extant documentation.

None of the tools look in the $RAYPATH directories for executables,  
and I don't store any there.

Hi Greg,

sorry for the late reply, just didn't find the time before.

They can't default to yes as they'd be added in automatic testing
environments (where all debconf questions are answered with the default
value) and installing the conflicting package could fail then.


I'm all open to other suggestions, we should find the final solution
within the next months, though.


Cheers,

Bernd

Well, I'm in a quandary on this, because I don't know how valuable  
having a Debian package is to the Radiance community relative to  
breaking most of the existing scene descriptions, if that's what it  
means.

Bernd, just a thought:

Can't we create a conflict between the two packages and keep the
existing 'genbox' command? After all, both seem to be very specialised
programs and I wouldn't expect them to be installed on the same system
(except university labs where the admins should know how to solve
this problem).

Mmmmm...I'll put forward my suggestion again as probably the best way  
to both satisfy Debian's namespace requirements and keep existing  
scene descriptions--the ".rad" language, really--working.  I'd go for  
putting the binaries in /usr/lib/radiance as a simple way to get them  
out of the main /usr/bin namespace; it is not terribly hard to add  
that to your path and I've been doing something similar for a very  
long time.

Hi All,

I will add my vote for Randolph's suggestion, this is what we have been 
doing as well (for a long time too), put both Radiance related binaries 
into a separate path location as well as Radiance related libs. This 
seems much cleaner as far as managing what amounts to a specialized 
toolset anyway.

Regards,

-Jack de Valpine

If creating a special Radiance binpath is not acceptable, another solution is to create the following scene fixing utility for distribution with Debian Linux Radiance distributions.  A little messy, but it would work.
