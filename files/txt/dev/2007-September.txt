Dear all,

I understand that many of you are busily preparing their presentations
for the Workshop, but hope that you can spare 5 minutes of your
precious time.

I've been toying about with a search engine that is fed with URLs
specific to Radiance, so results will not be watered-down by all the
other radiance things out there. Those of you that run servers
themselves and read their log files regularly might have noticed some
extra traffic this weekend caused by RaySearchBot. Hope this didn't
cause any hardware to catch fire, and I do apologize for any
inconvenience this might have caused.

Here is the link: http://luxal.dachary.org/raysearch/index.shtml

You'll find the sites and pages that are indexed on the Stats and
Sites page. I tried to guess what the structures of your sites are,
and how to get most of the pages relevant to the Radiance users, but
chances are that not all of what you see in the list is correct.

So: If you run one of those sites, please get in touch with me
off-list, so we can:
- discuss some optimization,
- remove your site if you don't wish to be included
- work out any problems

Anybody else is welcome to make any other suggestions on-list, e.g.
other pages that I am not aware of or simply forgot. The system is
still a bit rough around the edges, which is why I am not posting to
general yet, but please do try it out and let me know what you think.

For now, I intend to focus solely on technical infos on Radiance, and
don't want to include consultancy, general (day-)light stuff etc.
There are also still problems with non-english texts, Php-generated
sites (Francesco), and some PDFs.

Cheers

Axel
