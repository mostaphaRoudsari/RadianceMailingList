Subject: [Radiance-dev] Compiling rsensor on Windows
Message-ID: <4804DB79.7030401@rumblestrip.org>

Hi,

I'm trying to compile the new rsensor code* to run on windows.  I know 
it's possible, but I'm having trouble.  I finally have MINGW and MSYS 
installed on my computer and gcc as well.  That all works, I can get a 
running bash shell on my computer.  Problem is the makeall script is a 
csh script (MSYS, short for Minimal SYStem, is indeed a minimal cygwin 
installation). 

Plan B was simply to go into the /src/util directory and call "make 
rsensor".  But even after changing the rmakefile to read CC = gcc from C 
= cc, I still get an error saying cc not found.  Not sure why it's still 
trying to use cc instead of gcc; gcc is installed and in the search path. 

So plan C was simply to call gcc directly but the Rmake file references 
a .o file and I only have your rsensor.c file.  So I'm missing one or 
more steps that apparently happen ahead of this Rmakefile.  Can anyone 
help or suggest a way to get this utility to compile?(???????????)

*rsensor is a utility that Architectural Energy Corp. contracted Greg to 
create.  It's essentially a modified version of rtrace, to be used to 
read the spatial sensitivity of a photosensor, which Zack is 
incorporating in to his SPOT program (hence my need to get this to 
compile for Windows). It's still in test phase, but it's in the HEAD 
release in the spirit of open source.

Hi Rob,

Very timely ;-) Zack also asked me about this :-)

I have been trying to make a mingw binary package with yesterday's HEAD
snapshot 
from the CVS, but a few things have changed in the source code since
3R8, and
I am still trying to find my way around them.

rsensor needs libraycalls, libradiance and librtrad, so these have to be
compiled first, doing an rmake inside src/common and src/rt, and perhaps
crossing your fingers ;-)

In reality, the best approach I have found is to use scons.
Unfortunately
the last changes done on the Sconscript files are two years old 
(schorsch, where are you? we really miss you!) so I am patching things
here and there to get the core programs compiled.

I hope to be successful soon, and I'll post my findings to the Radiance
Wiki.

Keep the faith ;-D

Francesco

Hi Francesco,

Thanks very much for helping with this!  I forgot to mention that I  
wrote a set of stub routines for Windows in src/rt/raypwin.c that you  
can use in place of raypcalls.c.  They don't really handle parallel  
processing, but they'll get things going at least.

I hadn't noticed this little file before :-)
I'll try this later and summarise my findings about 
the recent code additions somewhere on the wiki.
 
Grazie!!!

That's great, Greg. I tried to compile with MS Visual Studio Express
and scons a few weeks ago. When I realised that there was more to do
than just fixing the scons files I left it at that. Seems that I should
pick it up again one of these days.

That's all I was hoping for.

Oh, so you're closer to doing this than I had thought based on your

Hello,

rsensor is now available from the radtools website:
http://www.bozzograo.net/radiance/modules.php?op=modload&name=Downloads&file=index&req=viewdownload&cid=4
Scroll down to find it and let me know if it works, I didn't have time  
to check it thoroughly.

I'll follow up later with instructions about how to compile on windows  
+ a new mingw installer including
also rsensor, ranimove and gendaylit.

Hi Francesco,

I'm sure I speak for everyone when I say THANKS for pulling this  
together.  The new mkillum also relies on the linked library calls,  
so it's important we make sure this is working, at least for single  
processors, in the next release.

Grazie!

Indeed; thank you very much Francesco!  Also, a clarification to my 
description of rsensor's purpose is in order, since I see you are also 
using it for your description on the download page.  rsensor computes a 
photosensor signal based on a sensor-specific spatial sensitivity, it 
does not actually calculate the spatial sensitivity.  The sensitivity is 
read in from a data file, sort-of the inverse of a photometric 
report/.ies file, provided elsewhere.  This is all based on some 
research Zack has.  You'd be surprised by the variability in response 
from the various photosensors out there on the market; some are quite a 
ways from cosine.  So, rsensor is able to act as a *vendor-specific* 
virtual photosensor, which is like, totally rad. =8-)

Thanks again Francesco!

I've finally found some time to describe the compilation process with  
SCons:
http://www.bozzograo.net/radiancewiki/doku.php/how_to_compile_radiance_using_the_mingw_tools_and_scons

At the end of the page there is a zipped diff file summarising the  
changes and workarounds
I had to use to make the code compile. Minor things, but it would be  
nice to integrate them
to the source code (except the "dirty bits").

I have just found out another "Unix for Windows" project, this time  
from AT&T, where they say
they provide fork ... has anybody tried this?

Saluti,

Francesco

Hi Greg,

regarding the long time it takes reading octrees (multiple with sizes > 50MB):

I've tested with setvbuf calls after the fopen in readoct and readobj with a 
size of 2MB (system default is 4kB).

Well- the number of reads went down, but the time for reading remained 
unchanged: 2.47min down from 2.48min.
It seems truly CPU (Xeon) limited, at least in this case, when reading from 
local disk (bandwidth>20MB).
Nevertheless, using a larger buffer than the default 4kB may make sense. E.g. in 
other scenarios (might be usable on NFS reads where mount rsize is larger than 
4k), with a minor chance of portability problems ("The setbuf() and setvbuf() 
functions conform to C89 and C99" it says in the man page). Ah, well, setbuf is 
already in use for setting up the ambient file. IMHO it might be a good thing to 
add to readoct, unless rendering is done on systems where an increased buffer 
takes away a significant part of valuable mem.

Hi Peter,

I'm not surprised to hear that readoct is CPU-bound, since it does a  
fair amount of processing on the buffered input.  Generally, you only  
reach the system performance limits when you are doing little more  
than reading data into memory, in which case memory mapping the file  
makes a lot of sense (for Unix systems that support it, anyway).   
Since readoct has to unpack the data and allocate octree nodes and  
leaves and so on, I'm not sure how best to speed up the process.

Perhaps the data doesn't need to be packed any more? There's hugely  
more memory available in modern systems than the ones you worked with  
when you developed that file format. Though I suppose the best thing  
to do is the by-the-book "instrument, then code" approach.

Hi Randolph,

There's no sensible way to read in an octree without doing some  
allocation along the way.  The file format is designed more for speed  
and portability than for speed.  Peter A-B and I found out (after  
instrumenting the code a bit) that the slow loads in his case are  
from the modifier usage more than anything else.  Peter will  
explain.  (Peter?)

Message-ID: <200804300942.m3U9gmeJ014488@mta2.lbl.gov>

Hi all,

The observed slow reading of frozen octrees happens if and only if:
- the geometric object (polygons in this case) each have their own, 
different modifier. This is probably rare, but  may happen if each 
polygon uses a texfunc to interpolate the normal.
- each of these modifiers have a unique name
It is only relevant if there are millions of such objects (e.g. 
tessellated surfaces imported from CAD).

Then the octree reading spends 96% of its time in otndx() (readoct.c), 
which handles a hash table. I would *guess* (not be field of expertise 
anyway) that the hash algorithm is slow under these extreme 
circumstances, since these unique modifier names are only inserted, but 
never ever re-used. Effectively this exotic scenario screws up the idea 
of having a hash table.

The solution (thanks Greg) was to use a modifier name for the texfunc 
that applies to all polygons with the same material, although each 
texfunc is different. This works since the texfunc is specified just 
prior to its polygon.
The decrease in loading time is noticeable: 18 versus 148 seconds for 
320MB of frozen octrees.

It is worth to note that, in a wider context and from a different 
perspective, this specific use of texfunc/polygons might be better 
served with the Radiance mesh primitive, resulting in less file and 
memory use and with faster reading and rendering.

As a general hint, reading of non-frozen octrees may be slower. Use of 
frozen octrees is recommended for speed (by Greg).

Regarding my suggestion to increase the stream buffer size for octree 
readings: The above timings use a 2MB buffer. Likely the 4k standard 
buffer size doesn't matter much for local discs, although I'm inclined 
to stick with the 2MB, because of the reduced. number of system calls. 
It may have a larger influence on NFS mounts, depending on the mount 
options. The only reason not to change the source is that *any* 
non-urgent change may introduce unforeseen side effects on some systems. 
Even if setvbuf seems to be a pretty much standardized call.

Thanks to Greg and the gprof profiler

cheers
Peter

Message-ID: <BC2A68B0-D7FA-4096-A8F7-C4A3DA5A6B2F@lmi.net>

If anyone out there is willing to lend a hand, I'd like to compile  
Radiance under Linux for a 3.9 release.  Please use whatever method  
you think will be most portable.  If that requires static links, fine  
by me.  I don't know Linux well enough to compile things portably,  
nor to I have convenient access to a machine to do so.  The release  
source may be downloaded from:

	http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/dist/rad3R9.tar.gz

Please respond and CC the list before you begin, so we don't  
duplicate effort.

Thanks in advance,
-Greg

Greg,

I can take a look at it for a few minutes now, and likely 
tomorrow morning as well. I'm not too sure if I can be of help, 
but I'll try.

Greg,

Reporting for a release (not unstable or testing) version of 
Fedora 8 i686, using gcc 4.1.2, with the default rmake command, I 
find that 3R9 builds completely. The dozen or so warnings are 
mostly about how mktemp is dangerous and that we should use 
mkstemp. Some other warnings are in libtiff, another about how 
gets is dangerous.

Great, thanks Mark.  That was quick.  Any chance of posting the  
executables somewhere so I can grab them?  Any comments from the list  
on how to ensure portability between Linux flavors?
