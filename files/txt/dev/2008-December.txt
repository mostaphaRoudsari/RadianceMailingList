Works fine now. Thanks for that. It's a very elegant solution. Those
built-in modifier in the CSH (e.g. :r, :t) are pretty nice. I didn't
realise they existed until now. I don't think there is a BASH
equivalent...

Hi Greg, Bernd

it seems that rad3R9supp.tgz has some of the directories under px/tiff missing.
These are the dirs in rad3R3supp.tgz:
contrib
html
libtiff
man
port
test
tools

but 3R9supp.tgz only has the following dirs under px/tiff:
libtiff
port

the compilation of HEAD bombs out with this error:
cd tiff ; ./configure -C -quiet -with-CC=gcc \
		"--libdir=`pwd`/../../lib" "--includedir=`pwd`/../../common" \
		--enable-static --disable-shared --disable-cxx \
		--enable-logluv --disable-jpeg \
		--disable-zlib --disable-pixarlog \
		"-with-ENVOPTS=-O2" ; \
	cd port ; make all ; \
	cd ../libtiff ; make install
appending configuration tag "CXX" to libtool
appending configuration tag "F77" to libtool
updating cache config.cache
config.status: error: cannot find input file: contrib/Makefile.in
make[1]: Entering directory `/home/axel/software/radiance/ray/src/px/tiff/port'
make[1]: *** No rule to make target `all'.
make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/axel/software/radiance/ray/src/px/tiff/port'

make[1]: *** No rule to make target `install'.
make[1]: Leaving directory
`/home/axel/software/radiance/ray/src/px/tiff/libtiff'
make: *** [../lib/libtiff.a] Error 2

I could compile the latest HEAD by copying across the missing dirs
from rad3R8supp.tgz. While doing so I was wondering if a little
README.linux in the ray directory would have solved this problem. It's
very straight-forward to install the development libs for libtiff
(libtiff-dev/libtiff-devel) on a LINUX system thanks to the excellent
package managers under Fedora/Debian/Ubuntu etc.

Bernd has been doing a fantastic job packaging Radiance for
Debian/Ubuntu. Any chance of having a little README.linux in the
official tar ball that would explain how to use the distro's native
libtiff-devel to compile Radiance? It's been 'documented' on the
mailing list, but that's not quite the same as a README. Greg, I know
you made the decision to ship the tiff libs with Radiance a long time
ago because there were too many problems in relying on the native
ones. Is this still the case, or has libtiff somewhat settled down a
bit?

As a sidenote, two of my students this year are proud owners of
MacBooks. Although the LEARNIX live CD-ROM works hunky-dory with the
Intel Mac hardware, one of the students expressed an interest in
installing Radiance on his MacBook. Since I know nothing about the
package management in MacOSX, or about compiling anything I could not
give him any advice. I understand he did spend some time trying to
work it all out, and managed to install the requirement (I don't even
know what to call it... Some Apple compiler/runtime thingy). Anyhow he
did not succeed in his endeavour. So I'm afraid other than "it didn't
work for him", I can't really describe the issues and problems. Many
of you guys are using Radiance on MacOS. Could one of you beam
yourself back in time to when your shiny new MacBook arrived on your
doorstep, and somehow document exactly what you did to get this
Radiance thing working? Kinda a Dummy's guide to installing Radiance
on a MacBook. This would be great to have on the web site, or even the
tar ball.

Many thanks

Axel

Francesco has already written down what's necessary to
compile on OS X:

http://www.bozzograo.net/radiancewiki/doku.php

I haven't compiled Radiance myself in ages because
Greg always provides the binaries (probably first of
all):

http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/dist/rad3R9_macosx.tar.gz

There are minor issues on OS X but they have been
covered a lot and if your student couldn't get it
to work he/she shouldn't use the source distribution
in the first place or search the in list archives
for the same problem.

Hi Axel,

Thanks for bringing this to my attention.  I have no idea how these  
directories were left off, but I've reinstated them in all the  
relevant distributions.

As for the Linux README regarding libtiff, I'm all for it, but not  
confident enough to write it myself, having never done it.  I also  
don't understand packages under Linux or Ubuntu, so I'd really prefer  
that someone else submit a README to put into the distribution.  I'd  
be happy to proofread it and include it.  I don't think there are any  
serious problems remaining between the packaged libtiff and the one I  
distribute, but again I don't have any Linux experience to draw on.

Cheers,
-Greg

I could write that, but first I'll have to update my patches to the latest
HEAD and see what needs to be done at the moment. Last thing I remember is
that I talked with Greg about some tiff related patches from me, and I think
they're applied in his tree. Didn't catch up with that as I'm spending more
spare time on Lenny related stuff at the moment.

Cheers,

Bernd

Brilliant! You guys rock!

Bernd, I know I half dumped you into this by even begging the
question. Thanks a lot for picking this up! I promise to put on my
Sherlock Holmes hat and give some good-quality dummy's level feedback.

Thanks for pointing this out. I was aware of Francesco's site, but did
not know the install instructions (sorry, Francesco).
Greg, do you think this would justify a link to Francesco's page on
the two download pages (radsite and radiance-online)? All the coding
gurus seem to run MacOS now. However, many Mac people are still of the
more artistic type. So even something like
'/your/preferred/path/to/the/binaries' might be too much. So where DO
I stick them? Come on... we all started off small.

Oh, and yes, I'm deliberately being a bit stubborn here.

Many thanks for you efforts and feedback

I agree we should have better linkage to Francesco's Wiki -- do you  
think it should go in the "Resources" list on radiance-online.org?   
Where would you look for it?  I don't think it belongs on the  
download page, personally.

As a Fedora, Debian and Ubuntu user, I am somewhat spoiled when it
comes to installing packages. More often then not, they are available
for download with one simple command. To be honest, I don't even know
if MacOS has a similar mechanism. Windows does not.

When I do have to get my fingers dirty with tar balls and compilation,
all instructions, including dependencies, make commands, compile
options, switches etc. are usually documented in one or more files
within the tar ball. This usually means:
- README: This software does so and so, is written and maintained by
this guy, published under such-n-such license. Please read LICENSE for
details about the license. For installation instructions please refer
to INSTALL.
- INSTALL: To build this, you need package1, package2 and package3.
This is how you build the thing: run ./configure, make, make install.
Or run ./makeall install etc. This is also where compile switches
would be listed, unless they are available through, e.g. ./configure
--help
- Then there might a PACKAGERS, for what Bernd is doing with the
Debian packages, possibly a MANIFEST, and potentially a few other text
files of special interest to certain groups of users, such as CVS
instructions for hackers. BUGS, ISSUES, TODO, But this already pushing
it. README and INSTALL are the two biggies.

It is very rare indeed to find a README which says: "For installation
instruction, please go to http://mywebsite.com/mysoft/install.html".
If the installation or configuration is very different between
platforms, there might be a README.linux, README.macos, README.win32
etc.

So I'm not sure that 'Resouces' is a good place for the install
instructions to live in. Should they not be within the tar ball, or at
least on the same download page?

Axel

Sure, but Francesco's site isn't a set of installation instructions.   
It's meant to be broader than that, and people can add and delete  
stuff at will.  There is no central location for installation issues  
as far as I know, other than the mailing list.

I don't install many packages these days, and I'm not familiar with  
the current conventions.  If anyone wants to clean up these  
instructions so it fits with others notions of the expected on Linux,  
I'll check in whatever they submit, but I don't promise to maintain  
it.  I'm pretty lousy at maintaining the instructions I have (in case  
you hadn't noticed).

The build system on Radiance doesn't use the standard configure  
scripts and so on, and there's little sense in adding them at this  
point.  Packages under MacOS X are generally installed as binaries.   
I've never bothered to make an OS X package for Radiance, though I  
certainly could.  Such a package would imply a nice application with  
a GUI, and that's not going to happen.  Radiance is not for the  
average user, and giving novices a nice, easy ramp that leads them to  
a cliff seems a bit cruel....

I was only thinking about the install instructions now, but you're
right: Francesco's site holds a lot more info than just that. So
'Resources' might be the right place for a link, after all.

I rest my case.

One of the things I tried in my experimental Radiance build scripts  
was testing for the presence of a system libtiff with logluv support  
and using it.  Is that something that's planned for 4.0?

Hi Randolph,

Do you think there's a way to do this with Makefile's?  One way I can  
think to do it is to modify the tiff target I used to have into  
separate targets for the local or system library.  What technique did  
you use to detect the presence of a libtiff with LogLuv support?

OK, I moved Francesco's Wiki from the "Links" page to the Resources  
entry in the navigation sidebar.

The README file is supposed to cover installation options.  If you  
want specific things added to it, or insist that it be broken into  
separate README and INSTALL files, I can do that as well.

the only ways which come into my mind to detect them automatically are not
platform independent and would require something like Gnu-Make. Even ifdef and
similar things don't work in all Make variants...

Could the test could be done in the makeall script, and the result  
used in Makefiles?

That's kind of what I was thinking.  Create different targets and  
stuff the appropriate one in the rmake script via makeall.  Still  
need a reliable way to determine (on any distro) the location and  
contents of the tiff library.  If I can find the location, I can  
probably use the nm command to look up the symbols and check that  
they're defined.

Subject: [Radiance-dev] proposal: switching executables from within rad?
Message-ID: <4949C32D.70202@gmx.net>

Hi folks,

this is something that was first proposed by Carsten in his Radzilla 
documentation:

"'radz' has one additonal option: you can set the name of the executable 
to call. This is very helpful in case you have several RADIANCE versions 
in parallel. The option name is '-x', example:

$> radz -x rzvu -o x11 test.oct /or/
$> radz -x rpict_xyz25_b test.oct /or whatever/...

If -x is not set, the RADZILLA execs will be run (either 'rzpict' or 
'rzvu', dependent on the additional setting of -o x11)."

Obviously noone ever cared about it later. Still, I think it may be 
useful, so I try to describe...

Radzilla provides a radz-tool, compareable to rad, which controls the 
rendering and filtering processes. As Radzilla heavily depends on 
Radiance, Carsten spent some time on integrating both, and one thing he 
did was adding an x-option to radz, which specifies the renderer to use.

E.g. radz -x rpict will use rpict, radz -x rzpict would run rzpict, radz 
-x rvu would open the preview.

I think this is a very elegant solution, even better then using the -o 
devices, as it allows e.g. combining binaries from different releases, 
or alternative projects such as radzilla, or patched tools, and still 
control all by rad without a need of symlinks, PATHs and so on.

While I like the solution in Radzilla, I guess it would become even 
better if these options would not be set as a command line option, but 
either as a optional variable in the rif-file or as an environment 
variable. I would also propose this to be a general mechanism for all 
tools that are called from inside rad. So my proposal would add optional 
xrpict, xmkillum, xoconv, xrvu, ... variables, which by default would be 
the radiance distribution's (that rad came witch) binaries, overwritten 
by environment variables, overridden by rif-file variables.

So... I could use all filters e.g. from the most recent radiance 
release, and combine with a pmap-extended rpict. Or I could run my 
renderings using radiance's rad, and by setting  an environment variable 
xrpict=rzpict could re-run all using rzpict to compare.

The reason I would like to have this is that I am currently processing 
the same scene, views using radiance classic, and older radiance+pmap 
and radzilla. I could go with scripts setting PATHs, doing symlinks and 
all that - but this is errorprone and not very transparent. I also think 
that these variables would be both helpful for folks having different 
radiance-releases installed (but only on is called from the PATH) or for 
debugging and development. So what do you think, would this be a 
reasonable addition to the already crowded rad-world of options and 
variables?

CU Lars.

Hi Lars,

This is an interesting proposal.  One way to do this would be to  
allow an executable to be named before options with the oconv,  
mkillum, and pfilt variables.  Variables could likewise be added for  
rpict and rvu, with the render variable used for both.  This with  
offer the further facility of having separate options for the two  
programs, which rad currently doesn't support but I've wished for now  
and again.

I'll work on this when I get some time.

Cheers,
-Greg

I thought about this, still I am a bit worried that this may break 
existing scenes' rif-files.

It would be much better not to add all those variables but extend the 
existing ones, of course.

It shouldn't break anything.  If the rad input file doesn't have a  
command at the start of an oconv or mkillum or pfilt option, it will  
use the default executable.  What's the problem?  The only issue  
would be using a new format rad input file with an old version of  
rad, but that's going to happen no matter what we do.

(Sorry it's taken so long to get back to you on this)

Looks to me like you could just compile and link a small test program 
which references libtiff and TIFFInitSGILog()--if it builds, libtiff 
with logluv support is in a default library directory. I think that's 
sufficient. If you want something more specific, I could work out a 
script that would identify the system's type and queries the package 
manager for specific file locations, but it seems like overkill to me.

That exactly what automake and co do... and imho that's sufficient.

The SCons build system does that now. If it finds a compatible
libtiff on the standard paths (or on a path defined in the
platform config file) it will use that, otherwise it builds the
included one as before. I've only tested it on linux, but it
should work on any platform, including Windows/cygwin/etc.

Hi,

as several people asked on how to build Radiance on older Debian variants
(like Ubuntu...) - would it make sense to add a howto like from the mail below
(the version number is not up-to-date there, but with some lines on how to
find the right file it's fine) somewhere on radiance-online, or include it
into a readme in the source?


Cheers,

Bernd

Hi Bernd,

This seems like Debian-specific advice.  Is there some way to roll it  
into your distribution other than putting it in the main one?  Where  
would a person look for such advice at radiance-online?

People who are in the need of a backport usually don't have a distribution
with those informations available (otherwise they'd have at least an
out-of-date package). Also there are a lot of Debian derivates, Ubuntu is just
a more well known one. So imho it would make sense to describe a way to do it,
I'm just not sure what the best place for it is. The other option would be to
figure out how backports in Ubuntu work, as far as I know they have something
like Debian's backports.org - but as I'm not an Ubuntu guy and I don't have
the necessary chroot available, I think that somebody else would have to take
care of "official" Ubuntu backports.


Cheers,

Bernd

Isn't a file INSTALL in the ray directory the right place to collect all 
this information? Having one section "old distributions" in such a file 
would allow to add information on sources such as backports, how to 
compile on old linux distributions and such. Here is also the place to 
collect hints on systems such as solaris, os x, the various windows 
ports - even if we have only urls to sites describing the procedure, 
that way users having problems to install could have a start. In the 
very beginning, the options

a) binaries from radiance-online.org and radsite
b) binaries coming with distributions
c) compiling from source (generic using makeall install) should be present,

than all the special work-arounds.

I have an ubuntu box running, is there need for an ubuntu maintainer? Be 
aware that I have no (aka zero aka nul) experience with package building 
except making my own ones, but I guess that building on top of Bernd's 
debian work, there are few changes to expect.

Lars.

Should we provide packages there, too - at least for older versions of Ubuntu?
For Debian I can upload a package to backports.org - using that should
probably described, too, as the package there is more uptodate than the
version which was part of the release.

Providing ofiicial Ubuntu backports sounds like a lot of work:
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuBackports

So I still think it's more easy to provide a way to build the packages,
especially since rebuilding them should work without any problems (at least
for all released which shipped with debhelper 5).

Does anyone want to take the reins on writing an INSTALL for the top- 
level directory?

I am turning back to this project, having finally found a bit of time.  
I've updated my draft registration form. It can be downloaded from <http://students.washington.edu/rfritz/radreg/Radiance%20Registration%20Form.txt 
 > user/password rad/rad.

Two questions only:

   1. Is the file header different on Windows because of the  
difference in newline convention?
   2. Is *Rendering with Radiance* still available from Booksurge?

Randolph

Hi Randolph,

Thanks for working on this!

> difference in newline convention?

No, a single newline ('\n') character should terminate each header  
line no matter what system you're on.  A carriage return ('\r') will  
be ignored, and not produced by any of the Radiance tools.

>   2. Is *Rendering with Radiance* still available from Booksurge?

You can buy it from Amazon:

	http://www.amazon.com/Rendering-Radiance-Science-Lighting- 
Visualization/dp/0974538108/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-5711964-3059265? 
ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1186177315&sr=8-1

The link perpetually says it's out of stock, but since it's print-on- 
demand, it doesn't matter.  I think it comes from BookSurge, but I  
don't think they have a link for it anymore.

Cheers,
-Greg

Hi Greg,

one main problem I still see for people who'd like to use the system's libtiff
are the tiff headers shipped in src/common:

0 bzed@think:~/workspace/debian/recluse/pkg-radiance/src/common(upstream-cvs)$
ll tiff*
-r--r--r-- 1 bzed bzed 30663 2008-08-28 00:57 tiff.h
-r--r--r-- 1 bzed bzed 19161 2008-08-28 00:57 tiffio.h
-r--r--r-- 1 bzed bzed   410 2008-08-28 00:57 tiffvers.h
0 bzed@think:~/workspace/debian/recluse/pkg-radiance/src/common(upstream-cvs)$

I think it makes more than sense to use the tiff headers shipped with the
distribution's libtiff package instead of the old versions included in the
Radiance source. Could they be dropped from src/common and only be copied in
there in case the libtiff from the Radiance source is being built?
The other option would be to change the Makefile which does the libtiff build
job to let libtiff install the tiff headers into a special subdirectory, so
this directory could be added to the CPPFLAGS with -I per default, but it
would be only used if there's something in it.

Cheers,

Bernd

Message-ID: <495AE79C.204@bzed.de>

Hi list,

I've created a cron job which pulls the daily CVS HEAD into upstream-cvs
branch in the git repository at
http://git.recluse.de/debian/pkg-radiance.git/
(pull from git://git.recluse.de/debian/pkg-radiance.git please)

In case you're wondering what all the branches are for:
- upstream-cvs: daily cvs head, downloaded and commited at 0730 my time
- upstream: Unmodified sources from Greg of the package I'm working on at the
moment.
- upstream-debian: Modified sources for Debian - please note that I only drop
files here, like the libtiff source or cruft from OSX editors.
- master: place where the packaging happens

Branches are listed in the order I merge Greg's changes. Debian's orig.tar.gz
is built from the upstream-debian branch.


Cheers,

Bernd


P.S. Git rocks!
