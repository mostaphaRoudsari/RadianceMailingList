Subject: [Radiance-dev] Errors when compiling 3R9 under Cygwin
Message-ID: <8467405c0806050724s1461206bxecae8d50a181b575@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

When helping my girlfriend (civil engineering PhD-student, CC on this
mail) compilling Radiance 3R9 I encountered the following problems:

When compiling I got the following errors:

ezxml.c: In function `ezxml_parse_fd':
ezxml.c:643: error: `MADV_SEQUENTIAL' undeclared (first use in this function)
ezxml.c:643: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
ezxml.c:643: error: for each function it appears in.)
ezxml.c:645: error: `MADV_NORMAL' undeclared (first use in this function)
make: *** [ezxml.o] Error 1
make: Target `install' not remade because of errors.

The errors are caused by the lack of a full set of definitions of the
macros in the version of the header file 'sys/mman.h' supplied with
the cygwin system (we are using the latest version available on
cygwin.com). Therefore the macros MADV_SEQUENTIAL and MADV_NORMAL are
not replaced by correct values by the preprocessor simply because no
definitions of the macros exist in the included header file.

As it can be seen this leads to a situation where the target 'install'
is not remade completely by Make leading to all sorts of strange
faults if the already built binaries are attempted used.

I have no suggestions for a resolution to the fault at the moment
since I have never developed anything for Cygwin and therefore I have
no knowledge about the internals of Cygwin. I have however been able
to identify a file in the cygwin tree where a definition of an
enumeration containing the needed macros are given. I don't know if
this is useful in any way.

I have been unable to locate a bug reporting system on your homepage
why I am writing this list instead. I hope this is all right.

Best regards

Hi Esben,

Try adding "-DEZXML_NOMMAP" to the rmake script and rerunning  
"makeall install" in the main directory or "rmake install" in the src/ 
gen directory.  Th ezxml.c module is new with this release and was  
provided by a third party, so I'm not well familiar with its  
portability issues.  So far, it seems quite robust.

There isn't a bug reporting system for Radiance, so thanks for  
alerting us to the problem.  Cygwin is not a properly supported  
platform, so you're on the bleeding edge.

Cheers,
-Greg

Hi,

> ezxml.c: In function `ezxml_parse_fd':

have a look if there's /usr/include/sys/mman.h and what is defined in
there, if the file exists at all.
If so you'll probably find POSIX_MADV_SEQUENTIAL and POSIX_MADV_NORMAL,
try to replace MADV_SEQUENTIAL/MADV_NORMAL by them. Unfortunately I
can't tell if it's save to replace them by default, but afaik it is.

Hope that helps,

Bernd

Hi Greg,

Thank you for your quick answer.

Your proposed solution seems to solve the problem as no errror are
reported  by the compiler any more.

I've found a code snippet from another project where they set
EZXML_NOMMAP whenever the code is compiled for Cygwin:

/* disable MMAP on CYGWIN, seems to cause problems... */
#ifdef CYGWIN
#define EZXML_NOMMAP
#endif

This could maybe be a solution for Radiance too. This will of course
require some modifications of the build system but will provide a
generic solution which can be extended if Cygwin causes other problems
and therefore needs special treatment :-).

Best regards
Esben

Hi Bernd,

Thank you for your suggestion.

I have grep'ed around in the include dirs of Cygwin but could not
locate the Posix versions of the macros anywhere. In the file
/usr/include/d/3.4.4/std/c/linux/linux.d however at least the
MADV_SEQUENTIAL and ditto NORMAL are defined in an enumeration as
mentioned in my first mail. Since I don't know the internals of Cygwin
I don't know the purpose of this enumeration.

Best regards
Esben

Thanks, Esben.  This is an excellent suggestion -- I didn't know what  
macros were predefined under Cygwin, so this is a big help.  I'll  
check it into CVS for the next distribution.

Cheers,
-Greg

Dear list,

Oooh, ouh, steady on now. The CP4R is still purely experimental. I've
not had enough feedback to release it to the big wide world. I have
actually been breeding over a rather serious question which might
potentially question the whole idea behind it. But do read on...

Let's just say that somebody has gone through the exercise of
measuring all RAL colours with a chroma meter, based on a set of
colour swatches. The readings are presented in XYZ format. Let's
further assume, just for the sake of the argument, that this somebody
has written a little script to convert those XYZ readings to RGB,
using Radiance's xyz_rgb.cal. Here is an example:

-- this guy's ---
#Radiance rgb values for RAL colors converted from X Y Z color coordinates
#X Y Z values measured with Minolta CM-2600D Illuminant D65 observer 10 degree
# RAL 8023  orangebraun
# X=18.9 Y=14.6 Z=3.2
# reflectance 0.1460
 void plastic RAL8023
 0
 0
 5  0.3017 0.0971 0.0150 0 0

-- from Radiance colour picker (data from the Internet, don't remember
where from) --
# RAL colour: 8023 Orange brown
# Reflectance: rho=0.476
void plastic identifier
0
0
5  0.676 0.426 0.176  0 0

-- from Radiance colour picker (converted from XYZ data) --
# Imported from XYZ: ( 18.9, 14.6, 3.2 )
# Reflectance: rho=0.404
void plastic identifier
0
0
5  0.644 0.335 0.126  0 0

Checked against this web site:
http://easyrgb.com/index.php?X=CALC
which gives pretty much the same results: (0.64380, 0.33552, 0.12613)
Also compare:
http://www.brucelindbloom.com/index.html?Eqn_XYZ_to_RGB.html

Your will appreciate that the measured values, converted to RGB are
wayyyyyy off mark.

I understand from this thread:
http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/digests_html/v2n8_1b.html
that the conversion algo is taken from:
"Procedural Elements for Computer Graphics" by David Rodgers (McGraw Hill),
which is sitting right next to me.

I have not gone through it yet to check for typos in yxz_rgb.cal, but
I find it unlikely that Greg has made such a mistake. It's far more
likely that I'm missing something here. One possible explanation would
be the primaries: xyz_rgb.cal uses the standard CRT primaries, whereas
it's unclear as to what the others are assuming.

Any enlightenment on the issue would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks for your feedback on this issue

Axel

Hi Axel,

Indeed, the RGB<->XYZ conversion in xyz_rgb.cal follows the  
derivation in Roger's book, and it's been checked pretty thoroughly.   
As you note, the actual results are determined by the choice of RGB  
primaries and white point, and this transform assumes you are going  
for absolute rather than perceptually white-adjusted values.  The  
primaries chosen are the standard ones for Radiance, which are a near  
miss to the CCIR-709 recommendation used for the sRGB color space and  
most modern computer monitors, which is given in xyz_srgb.cal along  
with a D65 (versus equal-energy) white point.

What other people have used for their color conversions is anyone's  
guess.

By the way, did you mean to respond to the radiance-general posting  
on radiance-dev as you did?  I'm not sure Nick and Steve are on this  
list....

Cheers,
-Greg
