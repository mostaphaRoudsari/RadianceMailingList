I have Tiger here but I see the same problem.

I just googled and man-paged a bit and it seems that wish is not started
correctly. If you can call wish directly with trad as argument and it  
works
that might be your problem, too. Try

	wish /usr/local/bin/trad    # or wherever trad is installed

This might be enough on it's own for you. If you want to allow students
to type simply 'trad' at the command prompt replace the #!/usr/bin/wish
line in trad with

	#!/bin/sh
         # the next line restarts using wish \
         exec wish "$0" "$@"

This is straight out of the man page. It starts the GUI but I haven't
used trad in a long time and I haven't tested if it crashes further down
the line.

Let your students test it. That's what they're there for.

Hi,

I am trying to compile on Solaris 10 using the Sun Studio compiler but 
am having issues. In particular, rpict does not get made (amongst other 
things). How can I go about getting some help debugging the problems? I 
can include the ./makeall install output, but it is rather lengthy.

Thanks!

Jim

Hi Jim,

Although lengthy, a good place to start would be to include output from 
the makeall script.

If I remember right, makeall does not stop if there's something going
wrong, so I'd edit it and add an 'echo' in front of the call to make,
and then take the output and run every line manually. For the Debian
package I re-qrote makeall, but that's not platform independent.
Although I could come up with a proper Makefile replacement for makeall,
if there's interest.
Also make sure to use the latest HEAD from cvs, probably it just works
then. Unfortunately I don't have access to a Solaris box anymore - my
last machines from SUN are working for the Debian project now ;)


Hope that helps,

Bernd

Alternatively, you can take the '-k' option out of the rmake script.

Hi all,

Thanks for all the tips. I'll give them a try later today and let you 
know how it goes.

Hi again,

Attached is the errors from th ./makeall install. I can't easily capture 
all the output in one file as it doesn't allow me to see the prompts. I 
guess I can write down my responses and try flying blind.

Anyway, any help is much appreciated.

I am using the latest CVS version plus the supplemental tarball, FYI.
