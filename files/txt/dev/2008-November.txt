I've now reviewed RFC 4288, *Media Type Specifications and  
Registration Procedures* (current best practices) with an eye to  
registering Radiance .pic/.hdr files as an internet type. I've avoided  
looking at other file types, at least for the moment. Here's some of  
my notes on this:

1. Since 2005, only a standards body can register an unqualified type;  
image/hdr, say. So we'd probably best come in as a "vendor" (broadly  
construed) type; image/vnd.radiance, perhaps. (I can make a case for  
vnd.radiance.hdr, but it seems like overkill).

2. We're encouraged (but not required) to submit information about the  
format of our files. I think it would be a good idea to submit the  
Radiance picture file format, possibly lightly edited and expanded.  
I'll sign up for the ietf-types@iana.org mailing list and see what we  
might submit.

3. We need to conduct a security analysis, though I don't think we  
have major issues here. The main one is that .pic format does use  
compression, which might be used in a resource-denial attack.

...to be continued...

My review of the relevant documents is available in <http://students.washington.edu/rfritz/radreg/

registration form. If anyone would care to take a look (Axel?) and see  
if I've missed anything obvious, please let me know. The directory is  
passworded to keep it from showing up in Google; the username/password  
is rad/rad.

Hi Randolph,

thanks for chasing this up. My comments are below...


Encoding considerations: Binary preferred.  This is a binary image
  type with a text header; "binary" or "base64" are the only
  reasonable choices.

Applications that use this media type: Radiance, HDR Workshop,
    Photoshop, TBD

+++ pfstools
more here: http://luxal.dachary.org/webhdr/software.shtml
.hdr is listed as RGBE

Additional information:
     Magic number(s): Text "#?RADIANCE\n" (octet sequence 23 3f 52 41
       44 49 41 4e 43 45 0a) at the beginning of the file
     File extension(s): pic, hdr
     Macintosh file type code(s): TBD

--- The .pic extension is officially dead and buried. Stick to .hdr.
It might be worthwhile also aiming for .rgbe and .xyze

+++ I don't think #?RADIANCE\n is quite good enough. It also matches
octrees (FORMAT=Radiance_octree). I would suggest that
FORMAT=32-bit_rle_rgbe or FORMAT=32-bit_rle_xyze needs to be in the
specs as well. The problem is that they don't have a fix position,
since this depends on the commands which were used to generate the
image.
I believe this is what the offset thingy is there for (although this
particular line does not work somehow):
<match type="string" value="FORMAT=32-bit_rle_rgbe" offset="0:500"/>

Here is a full .hdr header:

----------8<--------------

Would you mind if I forwarded your email to the pfstools mailing list?
I'd be happy to act as a gatekeeper and feed you only sensible
comments back. Can I leave the username/password in there?

Axel

I apologize that I don't have time at the moment to look at this  
thoroughly.

I just checked in the switch from ".pic" to ".hdr" throughout the  
HEAD release of Radiance 4.0a.

The "#?RADIANCE" line at the beginning of the file is, as Axel notes,  
not a unique indicator of a RGBE or XYZE file.  For that, you really  
need to find the format string, and I think the notion of "magic  
numbers" fails in most specifications of a header that could be any  
size, with the important string buried in it somewhere.  I only added  
the "#?RADIANCE" line as an afterthought in fact to provide something  
basic for the Unix "file" command to work with.

I've updated the registration form to account for the suggested changes:

1. Listed as many apps as I can find which work with the format.
2. Added the "rgbe" and "xyze" extensions.
3. Added a notes section at the end which indicates that the "pic"  
extension is deprecated, and explains that "?RADIANCE\n" is not a  
reliable identifier, as indeed no magic number is.

For the moment I am leaving Greg's email off the form; Greg, if you  
want direct e-mails on this, let me know and I'll add it. Once the  
spec is submitted, you'll be the change controller, with the final  
word on the format, but unless you really want the work, I don't see  
any reason for you to be getting direct e-mails.

Next to edit the specification, which may take a while because I am  
busy with other matters.

Meantime, yes, Axel go ahead and forward the proposal to the pfstools  
list. The username/password may stay in; the point is to keep the  
thing from showing up in Google searches, not to keep it truly secret.

Do keep in mind that the registration form is not the place for  
specification of the file format; there's only so much it can contain  
or, customarily, does contain.

Thanks so much for the follow-through, Randolph.  (And Axel as well)

Let me know if you need anything else from me, such as an updated  
document describing the format.  I could probably edit the one I have  
to single out the picture format and add in whatever may be missing.

Cheers,
-Greg

Can you add to the apps RadDisplay which is used for preview and analysis of
Radiance images?

I'm not sure how much we need to do here; citing RwR ch 18 might be  
enough, if that is still current. If it's not, an updated version  
would be very much appreciated; while we are not obliged to publish a  
specification for the format, it would probably save much confusion  
and many interoperability problems if we did.

Hi Randolph,

If by Chapter 18, you mean "filefmts.pdf" from the website, then I  
agree.  The only thing I could add are a few more header variables,  
but I lost the original source for this document, so editing it would  
be difficult.

That sounds good. BTW, if you want to recover the document, I can get  
Acrobat Pro to export the text; I think it will even export to MS-Word  
or HTML-ish code.

Cool -- I didn't realize you could do that with Acrobat.  I just  
tried, and it gets out the text and some of the formatting, but loses  
tables and things like that.  Still, a starting place for the  
desperate...

The XML export does pick up the tables and the format is relatively  
straightforward; I think you could just edit it back into tbl form, if  
that's what you use.

Message-ID: <100441490811300633h73961250j70a7fefda0fd79e@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Greg,

here is a fix which makes objline handle objects in subdirectories. It
used to only work in this form:
$ objline object1.rad
with the fix, it now also works like so:
$ objline objects/object1.rad

I had to use a few commands (dirname, basename, find) which weren't
utilised before, but hope that
a) they are available on other systems, too (Mac, Win). I've no way to
test this;
b) I didn't mess anything else up. It still works with input from STDIN.

Regards

Axel

Oh, and I also forgot to ask this:

You are using the undocumented -e switch to xform in objline. It seems
to do some expanding of something. Could you slip a note in the man
page?

Many thanks

Hi Axel,

The xform -e option is now the default, so is simply ignored.  I  
removed it all the same in my modifications to objline.

Download the HEAD sometime tomorrow and see if it works.  I took a  
slightly different approach than yours, and it may not work as you  
expect, but matches the behavior of xform exactly.

Best,
-Greg
