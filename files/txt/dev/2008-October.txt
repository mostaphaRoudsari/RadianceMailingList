Hi Greg,

I just tried to compile the current HEAD release and remembered this post of yours, so I threw your customized Rmakefile into ray/src/px. Unfortunately this didn't work as expected. Every line in the file that was referring to .../common/ failed. 
I changed those lines to ../common and now everything compiled just fine. Is my system (or csh) missing something or in other words, ist the notation of .../ something that should actually work? Just curios...

Regards,
 Erwin

Hi Nick, The libtiff distribution I currently have in Radiance seems to have a broken build system, and is failing on a lot of platforms. I think I just need to remove it, and clear the related dependencies from px/ Rmakefile. I'm pretty sure libtiff is included in most modern OS's, though I could use some verification on that point. I'm copying this discussion to the dev list, and we'll sort it out there. Meanwhile, you should be able to get the px tools to compile by substituting the attached px/Rmakefile and running "rmake install" in the px directory. Best, -Greg

Message-ID: <00038B3A.48EB658B@192.168.0.81>

Hi,

I just discovered the new -n option in rvu and had to try it instantly of course ;-) Pretty neat! I didn't have time yet to investigate the necessary code changes for this new option but I would like to ask if there is a chance that we'll see a similar feature for rpict in the (near) future? I know about and have used ranimate but a simple rpict -n sure does make parallel rendering easier.

Hi Erwin,

You got me on that one -- I have no idea where ".../common" might  
have come from.  It's not in the Rmakefile I attached to my original  
e-mail.  It's a mystery.

Hi Erwin,

Unfortunately, adding -n to rpict isn't as simple as it was to add to  
rvu (not that it was particularly simple there, either).  I have  
pondered the problem for some time and not come up with a suitable  
solution.  Basically, I would have to rewrite the sampling code for  
rpict, which is more than I have time for at the moment.  I agree a  
parallel rendering option to rpict would be very handy, but I don't  
expect to create one anytime soon.  I'm afraid we're stuck with  
rpiece for now....

Sorry.

Subject: [Radiance-dev] behavior of 3ds2mgf
Message-ID: <00038B59.48EB9BD9@192.168.0.81>

Hello all,

I have two 64bit machines here running und Gentoo Linux. When compiling the latest HEAD everything works just fine, all executables are built.
After running a few tests I discovered, that 3ds2mgf seems to be broken. This is the content of rmake:

#!/bin/sh
exec make "SPECIAL=" \
        "OPT=-O2" \
        "MACH=-Dlinux -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -L/usr/X11R6/lib -I/usr/include/X11 -DNOSTEREO" \
        ARCH=IBMPC "COMPAT=erf.o" \
        INSTDIR=/opt/ray/bin \
        LIBDIR=/opt/ray/lib \
        ESUFFIX= \
        CC=gcc "$@" -f Rmakefile

"3ds2mgf file.3ds" only produces "file.mgf" with this content:

c R =
        cxy 0.640 0.330
c G =
        cxy 0.290 0.600
c B =
        cxy 0.150 0.060

i file.inc

and "file.inc" is empty. Can anyone reproduce this or maybe even better has a hint as to where I can start debugging this problem? 
It seems all 32bit versions (older compiles) run fine on the same systems, i.e. they produce the expected output.

Thanks in advance,
 Erwin

Hi Erwin,

I'm pretty sure the problem is in 3ds2mgf.c:

float read_float()
{
     dword data;

     data = read_dword();

     return *(float *)&data;
}

which assumes that "unsigned long" is 4-bytes long.  This bit of code  
would actually work on a BigEndian system (I think), but not on  
Intel.  This is not my code, so I'm not 100% confident on this fix,  
but try it:

float read_float()
{
     union { dword i; char c[8]; } u;
     dword data;

     data = read_dword();

     if (sizeof(dword) == sizeof(float))
         return *(float *)&data;

     u.i = 1;
     if (u.c[0] == 0)
         return *(float *)&data; /* assume big-endian */

     if (sizeof(dword) != 2*sizeof(float)) {
         fputs("Unsupported word length\n", stderr);
         exit(1);
     }
     u.i = data;
     return *(float *)&u.c[4];
}

I have tried your patch but it didn't change things really. Out of curiosity I compiled the current head on a 32bit machine (also under Linux) and I get the exact same behavior (using the original 3ds2mgf.c). 
So I finally tried an older binary of 3ds2mgf (Radiance 3.6a) on the same system and this one works just fine. Unfortunatly I dont have the sources anymore to see what happens if I compile them 
Somehow I get a feeling it might have to do with the gcc version I am using on all these systems nowadays: 

# gcc --version
gcc (GCC) 4.1.2 (Gentoo 4.1.2 p1.1)

For all older compilations I am pretty sure I was still using gcc 3.*. 
Just in case that helps.

Dear Erwin,

I don't know if the gcc is really the problem - but if yes, see below an
instruction how to build an older gcc version with a newer one. I use
that for compiling esp-r- which also has trouble with gcc4.xx.

Then you have two gcc versions in parallel. Be careful while installing:
you have to use the /make bootstrap /otherwise you can destroy your
system (if you install it as root it replaces the existing libraries - 
I once  destroyed my system  with that....)
Before using programs compiled under gcc3.x, you have to set the library
path to the related lib-path ( export LD_LIBRARYPATH=/opt/gcc33/lib or
similar).

Good luck!

Jan

------------- Instruction to build an gcc 3.3.6, using gcc4.xx
---------------------------

Get gcc-core from from GCC Mirrors Page

Compiling GCC-3.3.6:

Untar the source then configure with:
./configure --prefix=/opt/gcc33 --program-suffix=-3.3
WARNING: Do NOT configure it with the default prefix! It is recommended
to compile it with this prefix else you can damage your system!
Now compile it with make bootstrap and after that install it with make
install.

Hi Bernd,

thanks for the offer, I will send you the exact same file plus the commandline I used in a private mail. And of course I will report back to the list later once we have solved this issue - just in case others run into this problem too. Actually radiance-general will probably be more apropriate for the report.

Dear Jan,

thanks for the pointer. I am using Gentoo Linux on all my servers and they also have howtos about this topic. The warning is definitely an important one though...
I will first try to find a version of Radiance where 3ds2mgf still worked and compare the sources, then I will know if it's worth the effort. I am sure I have some old machine with gcc 3.* somewhere, I guess I will try that first.

# gcc --version 
gcc (GCC) 4.1.2 (Gentoo 4.1.2 p1.1) 

For all older compilations I am pretty sure I was still using gcc 3.*. 
Just in case that helps.

Duncan.

You can find Windows installers on Francesco Anselmo's website:

http://www.bozzograo.net/radiance/modules.php? 
op=modload&name=Downloads&file=index&req=viewdownload&cid=4

Please read the package descriptions to decide which package is the  
best for your.

After the installation you may have to set an environment variable to  
point to
the installation directory. Please see the documentation (README)  
files included
in the package. I haven't done this recently so I don't know if it's  
still necessary.

All Windows installers miss some of the tools included in the Unix  
distribution.
You can replace things like 'ximage' and 'falsecolor' with raddisplay:

OK, thanks for the additional explanation.  I'm moving this thread to  
the development list for those who want to continue with it.  It's  
really out of my domain.

Best,

Brilliant!

I've looked into this, but are are not sufficiently confident with HDR
file format.

Let's move this thread over to dev and continue there.

That's a great idea -- there may be a MIME type for HDR files  
already, so be sure not to step on any toes.  Thanks for  
volunteering, Randolph, as I wouldn't know how to go about it.

Cheers,

Randolph,

The official mime types are assined by the IANA:
http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/

Getting .hdr accepted by IANA would mean that eventually all other
mime assignment, e.g.
for the various LINUX desktops:
http://standards.freedesktop.org/shared-mime-info-spec/shared-mime-info-spec-latest.html
will pick it up

I started a thread here:
http://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/radiance_mailinglists/dev/2006-November/000761.html
but it didn't lead anywhere.

When I said I was not sufficiently confident about the file format,
then this is what I meant:
(see http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/filefmts.pdf)

HDR comes in two flavours:
- RGBE
- XYZE

Each of those two flavours has three sub-flavours:
- non-rle
- rle
- mixed

Greg (http://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/radiance_mailinglists/dev/2006-November/000766.html):

I decided not to sub-type based on the presence or absence of run-
length encoding.  Since the reader routines identify RLE on a per
scanline basis (and in fact there can be a mix of RLE and
uncompressed scanlines), there seemed no need for a separate format
specifier.

Again, I wouldn't bother to distinguish these within MIME.  It would
be like distinguishing between different classes of TIFF.  Any
software that opens an RGBE file will also open an XYZE file, even if
it won't display the colors correctly.

So there you go...

I've started working on a mime XML file following the freedesktop.org
style. This is to make my yearly chore of rolling LEARNIX somewhat
easier. It's not well tested yet, but here is the first draft. The bit
with the extensions seems to work, but I haven't tried yet what
happens when the extension is removed (mime magick).

Ignore all non-HDR stuff. I just thought I might as well leave it in,
in the hope of getting some comments.

It looks pretty straightforward; I'll have to review the submission  
requirements in more detail, but I don't see serious problems. We'll  
probably have to come in as an organization-specific type ("image/ 
vnd.radiance"), since an unqualified type now has to come from a  
recognized standards body. I'll get back with more details later this  
week.
