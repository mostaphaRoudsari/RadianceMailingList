Hi Nick,

The libtiff distribution I currently have in Radiance seems to have a  
broken build system, and is failing on a lot of platforms.  I think I  
just need to remove it, and clear the related dependencies from px/ 
Rmakefile.  I'm pretty sure libtiff is included in most modern OS's,  
though I could use some verification on that point.  I'm copying this  
discussion to the dev list, and we'll sort it out there.

Meanwhile, you should be able to get the px tools to compile by  
substituting the attached px/Rmakefile and running "rmake install" in  
the px directory.

Best,
-Greg
