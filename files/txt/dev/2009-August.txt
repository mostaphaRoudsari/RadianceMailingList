Hi.

for your info, the binaries I created run fine. Obviously something is 
wrong with the binaries Ubuntu provides, at least for amd64. So this 
topic is not for the radiance-dev list but for Ubuntu.

Cheers, Lars.

As nobody will take care of bug reports in Ubuntu (as nobody knows about the
package and there is no real maintainer) - you'll have to stick with me :P
If the Debian package works and the Ubuntu one not - there is not much I can do
except asking for a rebuild.

Please build radiance from my git as described before and see if the bug is in
there.

Cheers,

Bernd

could you figure anything out? Ubuntu is starting to freeze again, if there is
something to fix, it should be fixed now.
The CVS head from 20090601 is in Ubuntu now, which is pretty old already
compared with what I have in Debian.

Greg: I've seen that you were doing various minor changes during the last weeks
- when is a good day to get your CVS Head and push it to Ubuntu? I think you've
tried to fix Lars' bug !?


Cheers,

Bernd

Subject: [Radiance-dev] Any problem with 1024 open files?
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0908092256010.9388@rygar.gpcc.itd.umich.edu>

I just had to increase the maximum number of open files (MAXFILE) 
in px/pcompos.c from 512 to 1024 to complete my current 
rendering. I see from "ulimit -a" on my Linux machine that 1024 
is my shell's limit. Can we either assume that users' limits are 
similarly high and reset MAXFILE for the next release, or can we 
perform some system check before opening more files than the 
shell will allow? (Or should I just accept that I try to push 
Radiance too far?)

I checked in an increase to 1024 inputs for pcompos and pcomb.
