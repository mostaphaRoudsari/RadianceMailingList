Mark Baker on the IETF list thinks we're good to go.  I'm ready to  
submit the attached to the IANA on behalf of Greg Ward and "The  
Radiance Lighting Simulation Group" (which means us) & will do so  
tomorrow.

To: ietf-types@iana.org
Subject: Registration of media type image/vnd.radiance

Type name: image

Subtype name: vnd.radiance

Required parameters: None

Optional parameters: None

Encoding considerations: Binary preferred.  This is a binary image
  type with a text header; "binary" or "base64" are the only
  reasonable choices.

Security considerations: The Radiance HDR file format does not include
  executable code or scripts; it is a graphics file with an ASCII
  header. Compression is used, which could crash an image
  viewer. There is no way to completely rule out the possibility of
  malicious content, however HDR viewer applications do not usually
  run with administrator privileges--they seem poor targets for such
  attacks.

Interoperability considerations: byte orders are spelled in the
  published specification; we expect that Radiance HDR files will be
  readable on all systems.

Published specification: *Radiance File Formats*, available freely at
  <http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/> and also as part of Ch 18
  of *Rendering With Radiance* (Booksurge/Amazon, ISBN 0974538108).

Applications that use this media type: Adobe Photoshop, AHDRIA,
  AHDRIC, CinePaint, FDRTools, hdrgen, HDR Shop, PFStools,
  Photosphere, Qtpfsgui, RadDisplay, Radiance, Web HDR

Additional information:
     Magic number(s): Text "#?RADIANCE\n" (octet sequence 23 3f 52 41
       44 49 41 4e 43 45 0a) at the beginning of the file.
     File extension(s): pic, hdr, rgbe, xyze
     Macintosh file type code(s): 

Person & email address to contact for further information: rfritz@u.washington.edu

Intended usage: COMMON

Restrictions on usage: none

Author: Randolph Fritz

Change controller: Greg Ward (gregoryjward@gmail.com) / The Radiance Lighting 
    Simulation Group

Notes:
1. The "pic" extension is also used for Macintosh PICT files; it is deprecated.
    
2. The rgbe and xyze extensions represent information about the content of the files,
    and may conflict with the actual content of files. Applications should check.
    
3. Radiance also uses "?RADIANCE\n" as a tag for its octree files;
    applications should read the file header to confirm that the file
    is indeed a Radiance HDR file, as described in the specification.

Not sure how complicated this would become (but throwing it out there)
... Would it be feasible to implement an option to call rpiece via rad?
Maybe -p option similar to the -N option for rad could call multiple
rpiece commands for each view instead of a rendering a view on each
processor. This would be useful for speeding up single views or when
getting that first output quickly is preferred.

My little experience with rpiece has produces sometimes spotty results,
so I don't know if this might make errors trickier to troubleshoot.

Hi Christopher,

I have given this some thought in the past, and the problem is,  
rpiece is not really that reliable or well-supported.  I'm therefore  
reluctant to include it with the more dependable programs called by  
rad.  Also, rpiece is made to be run over multiple machines, which  
rad cannot easily support.

Have you tried using rvu (rad run with -o) and the -N option on your  
multiprocessor?  If what you're after is a quick preview, this works  
rather well in the latest release.

Best,
-Greg
