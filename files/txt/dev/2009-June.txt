Subject: [Radiance-dev] Intel (icc) Compiler?
Message-ID: <DF4A9C5A0CC2DF438AC1834530C59EE001CB27C341@MAILBOX1.nrel.gov>

Has anyone tried using the Intel icc compiler to compile the Radiance source? I have access to a fairly new Mac quad core box with the icc compiler and was wondering if anyone has used it. I hear some significant increases can be made, but I also hear the icc user's guide is 250 pages long. =)  Wondering if anyone on the list has tried it out. Didn't see any listings on Mark Stock's benchmark page.
