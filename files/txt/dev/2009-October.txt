Hi,

> I am a new user to radiance. I have compiled the Radiance V3.9 code in Ubuntu 8.1 and there were some errors during the compilation. I ran the tests in ray/test directory and the results are attached in text file. Kindly let me know whether the radiance installation is alright or I have to reinstall them.

I doubt that the tests are uptodate at all, the Scons buildsystem doesn't seem
to be maintained. You might want to look at what I'm doing for the official
Debian packaging, see http://git.recluse.de/?p=debian/pkg-radiance.git;a=summary
It shouldn't be hard to build the current Debian version into proper packages
for older Ubuntu releases. I could even throw them into an Ubuntu PPA and build
it for older releases.

Cheers,

Bernd

Hi Ganesh,

I have not used the scons tool to compile radiance before. However, it 
looks to me like these errors relate to testing compiled radiance 
commands rather than actually doing the compile. To assure yourself of a 
clean compile it might make more sense to use the " makeall" script to 
do a fresh compile:

    ./makeall clean
    ./makeall install

then if you get errors you can report those as they will relate to the 
actual compile process.

Do people actually use Scons to build radiance? Is this something that 
should still be maintained or perhaps removed?

Regards,

-Jack de Valpine

Scons is the only way to compile Radiance on some platforms.
I've just checked in a minor update to keep up with some
recent changes (stuff in the source tree getting [re]moved).
Unfortunately nobody besides me ever bothered to contribute
test cases, so the tests still have very limited coverage.

Hi Georg,

My apologies, I do recall now that is part of the rational for Scons. My 
world view tends to be pretty linux centric, so I sometimes forget about 
the other options out there.

Are we correct though that the errors are relating to the running of the 
test cases and not the actual compile of radiance?

Best,

-Jack

- you're missing some -dev packages. Look which header files are missing, search
which package they're included in and install them
- if you want to install to /usr/local, you might need to run the install part
as root

The better solution for you might be to run

sudo apt-get install radiance radiance-materials radiance-doc

as Ubuntu 8.10 ships with radiance 3R9.
Don't forget to read /usr/share/doc/radiance/README.Debian afterwards.

Cheers,

Bernd

Ganesh.

One problem is that you don't have X11 development files installed (like
"X11/Xlib.h", "X11/Xutil.h"). Add the package from your repository. That
should deal with most of the problems.

Then you don't have permissions to add or delete files in "/usr/local/"
where Radiance would be installed by default. You have to run "./makeall
install" as a "sudo" command or as root.

Regards,
Thomas
