Subject: [Radiance-dev] SCons + Windows for Radiance 4.0?
Message-ID: <07186B30C3DFE948B0EE2862AC1999F70A00E0AD43@MAILBOX2.nrel.gov>

Hello, I was pleasantly surprised to find that I could compile Radiance 3.9 with only minor modifications using the SCons scripts and both MSVC and MinGW on Windows.  However, the latest release of Radiance 4.0 is giving me a lot more trouble.  There is a typo in 'build_utils/find_libs.py' where 'v = env.FindFile('Verdana.fnt', './lib')' should be 'v = env.FindFile('Veerdana.fnt', './lib')'; this leads me to believe that the SCons scripts weren't even tested for this release, is that right?  Getting past the minor issues there seem to be some deeper problems for Windows (use of timegm function is where I stopped this function is not in the standard <time.h>).  So my question is, is anyone planning on trying to get Radiance 4.0 compiling using SCons on Windows (either MSVC or MinGW) without requiring cygwin?

Thanks a lot,
Dan

Hi Daniel.

I believe the update of the scons scripts for 3.9 is largely due to
Francesco's efforts with mingw. I tried to compile 4.0 a few weeks ago
and search the list for mails about compiling on Windows. Most of
Francesco's comments where already in place.

I didn't get too far with my own efforts although I was surprised that
most of the core apps did compile fine. I had to change a few bits
here and there and modify the includes. I also came across the time_gm
(?) issue and replace it with a function that is part of time.h on
Windows. I think it's only used to produce a time stamp and at that
moment I just wanted to see if I could get the stuff to work at all.

In the end I gave up when it came to rtcontrib and all the definitions
from ray.h where suddenly not available any more. I couldn't find what
was wrong with my limited knowledge of C and because it was just
curiosity that made me do it in the first place I gave up.

I hope someone who is actually using Windows will pick it up soon.

Regards,
Thomas

Subject: [Radiance-dev] Cross-platform pcomb command-line processing
Message-ID: <FAC70B0C-1DD5-4A56-820F-E6A848F38998@panix.com>

The variations across platforms you see is because pcomb itself does  
not process the quotes, relying instead on the OS and the C API to get  
the arguments. So arguments are processed in different ways. At the  
risk of providing too much information, here's a writeup of how and why.

On Unix, the OS passes pcomb a list of arguments without quotes and  
any substitutions done to pcomb, which never sees the quotes or  
substitutions at all. A Unix shell processes single and double quotes  
and does command-line substitutions.

On Windows a string is passed to the C library, which creates the list  
of arguments and then invokes pcomb. The C library only recognizes  
double quotes. The full arcane details of the Microsoft C library's  
argument processing are documented at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa243471%28VS.60%29.aspx 
. I'm not sure what the GNU C library (mingw) does on Windows.

The Python "subprocess" module can be used in two different ways: to  
invoke pcomb directly (shell=False), in which case a sequence is  
preferred, and no processing is done on the sequence; "subprocess"  
makes every effort to see that that sequence becomes pcomb's argument  
list on all platforms. If, on the other hand, if shell=True is used, a  
string argument is preferred, and pcomb is invoked indirectly through  
a shell. My general preference is for shell=False, since one can get  
amazingly confusing results passing already-processed arguments  
through a shell, but there are some uses for shell=True.

On 10.5.8 / Python.org Python 2.5.4:
   It starts, & I can view images. If I press "convert," however, I  
get a "broken pipe" message from combineImages.

Does this work on 10.6?

Yes, here! OS X 10.6, Python 2.6 from the system.

One tip: start with -d command line option and watch the messages  
scroll by.

Ah. That reminds me ...

Depending on how you start it, you probably don't have the Radiance
binaries in your PATH. If you use Terminal.app you can use your
~/.bashrc but if you want to click and perhaps drag an icon you need
an ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist. But if it can't find the binaries you
shouldn't be able to load the image in the first place ...

It does here. "broken pipe" is usually the result of a binary not
found or a wrong command line. wxfalsecolor does not check the
settings in the text boxes, btw. If you give an argument that would
not work with falsecolor/falsecolor2 it won't work in wxfalsecolor.

If you set the DEBUG property of FalsecolorImage it will report all
command lines and how they are passed to Popen.

Hth,

Having never even heard of Scons until I started trying to build
Radiance I've no idea where to start at trying to fix this. I'm assuming
the problem is because there are 2 arguments in the source & only one in
the target but the Sconscript files are far from readable never mind
finding the actual one where the problem lies.

If it helps I'm building on Windows XP 64-bit using Scons 1.2.0, Python
2.6.4 & MinGW 5.1.6. Any help will be most appreciated.

The SCons community is at <http://www.scons.org/>

I'd take a look at this, but these days I don't have convenient access  
to a Windows system.  Hmmm.  Maybe...

The main problem is that the scripts were written for an older
and slightly incompatible version of SCons, which results in the
deprecation warnings, and probably the error as well.
Windows vs. unix is not an issue here.

I just moved and DSL isn't conntected yet at my new place, so it
may take some time until I'm able to look into it. 
But then, SCons isn't quite as arcane as you seem to think, and
the tracebacks tell you *exactly* where to look... ;)

If you let me know which version of Scons is best to use I'd happily
track it down & install it as I'm doing all this building on a virtual
machine anyway.

I was following the How-To guide at
http://www.bozzograo.net/radiancewiki/doku.php?id=how_to_compile_radianc
e_using_the_mingw_tools_and_scons & had to figure out that Python 2.x is
required for Scons, not Python 3.x so picking the right version of Scons
too would be a great help. Looking at their repository in Sourceforge
there are 1.1, 1.0.1 & 1.0.0 available. Once I figure it out I'll update
the Wiki page.

Tried updating to Python 2.6.5 & Scons 1.3.0, still the same issues as
you'd expect. Going to try Scons 1.1.0 now & see how it goes.

You can ignore the warnings, they are harmless and will be
dealt with in time.

The real problem is a bug in my scripts, which collides with
some inconsistencies in the Radiance file tree. Looks like
I should have tested the installation code more thorougly,
but I just didn't expect it to suddenly cause trouble.

The problem is hat several files in the Radiance source tree
exist in identical duplicates. SCons tries to install both of
them onto the same target, for which it has no solution.
I don't currently have access to the most current distribution,
but in my source tree those are:

ray/lib/clockface.hex   ray/src/gen/clockface.hex
ray/lib/surf.cal        ray/src/gen/surf.cal
ray/lib/lamp.tab        ray/src/cv/lamp.tab

Solution: The SConscript files in the  the ray/src/gen and
ray/src/cv directories each have a variable assignment near
the bottom of the form:
   LIBFILES=Split('a b c d')
Ignoring any syntactic variations, the problem files are part
of the 'a b c d' list. Just remove them one by one (leaving
some whitspace as seperator for the remaining entries) until
installation succeeds.

Obviously that is only a stop gap measure for now. The real
solution would be to eliminate the file duplication. As far
as I can tell, the makeall script currently installs each of
them twice, one copy overwriting the other.
