IIRC there were some problems with libtiff on Windows. This has only been
solved recently (since libtiff is part of the source).

Perl script. Not useful without Perl ...

X11 only.


All in all about 4 established apps missing. Not bad for a build system
that's basically unmaintained.

Hi Pally,

Thanks for the additional information.  I can make the changes you  
suggest to remove the "duplicate" installs, but can you reassure me  
that I'm doing the right thing by pointing out WHERE these files are  
being duplicated?  I can find no other mention of them in any of the  
SConscript builds.

As Thomas pointed out, Windows is not a maintained platform for  
Radiance at this point, and any changes I make to the SCONS files have  
associated risks, since I can't even test them.  Nevertheless, I have  
checked in the changes you suggested and added in the one C program  
(dctimestep) that was missing.  I don't know what to do about the Perl  
scripts, if anything.  Suggestions are welcome.

Best,
-Greg
