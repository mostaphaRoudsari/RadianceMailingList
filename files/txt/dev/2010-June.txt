Hi,

I've just tried latest HEAD version installation on Windows XP, SP3, and
have next errors:

###############

F:\Instalacije\ray>C:\Python26\Scripts\scons build
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
Detected platform "win32" (nt).

Also it doesn't want to start building if supplementary files aren't
included (previous version of Scons script build and installed even without
lib files).

#####

What I have tried to do:
****
If I replace line:
opts = Options(OPTFILE, ARGUMENTS) with
opts = Variables(OPTFILE, ARGUMENTS)
only depreciation warning is removed, and the rest of the error remains.

******
For error in line 81, I've tried to replace this path string with list in
SConscript(), but the same errors again.

****
Comment out line 81. I've got next error during building:
F:\Instalacije\ray>C:\Python26\Scripts\scons build

****
Yse old SConstruct file from 25th May instead of current one.
The same error as previous one:
...
SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal

################

I'm using Python 2.6 and installed scons 1.3.0




Any ideas?

Marija

I'd say env.get('RAD_COMPAT') returns a string instead of a string
wrapped in a list. Try to add a print statement before this line to
see the value of RAD_COMPAT (and possibly all the other vars). Once
you know which value is not a list you can either search where it get
set (wrongly) or modify the above line to something like

ALL = RTSCENE + RTPIC + STD + RTNET + [env.get('RAD_COMPAT',"")]

or similar.

The error is raised by the Python interpreter in the "ALL = ..." line
above. Modifying "opts=" will have no effect here.

The error is not in line 81; it's in line 47. It just get's passed up
through the stack until it reaches the top level function SConscript()
in line 47 where the Python interpreter complains.

Mix of double and single quotes around "raycalls.c"

Further to Marija's email, the following notes were sent to me by my colleague the other day. This may be redundant info, but Dan made the following changes:

C:\working\radiance\ray\src\common\SCronstruct:
line 32) RTIO = Split('''fdate.c fgetline.c fgetval.c fgetword.c fputword.c loadvars.c portio.c wordfile.c words.c header.c''') -> RTIO = Split('''fdate.c fgetline.c fgetval.c fgetword.c fputword.c loadvars.c portio.c wordfile.c words.c header.c timegm.c''')

line 47) ALL = RTSCENE + RTPIC + STD + RTNET + env.get('RAD_COMPAT',[]) -> ALL = RTSCENE + RTPIC + STD + RTNET

C:\working\radiance\ray\src\rt\SCronstruct:
line 21) raycalls = env.Object(source="raycalls.c') -> raycalls = env.Object(source="raycalls.c")


...and this allowed him to compile with MinGW.

Geez, I hate working on stuff I don't understand...  I just checked in  
the minimal set of changes Rob suggested below, and am looking forward  
(yeah) to feedback on whether it works or not.  I gave up on the  
RAD_COMPAT environment setting.

Sorry, I was just passing along some info that I don't understand either, really. Just hoping that the work these other folks are doing moves the community closer to easily compiled Windows binaries of Radiance. I still think everyone should learn to love Linux or OSX, but this seems unlikely...

Don't get me wrong -- I do appreciate the help.  The simpler and less  
ambiguous the instructions, the better, which is why I went with  
yours.  If not all of the problems got addressed this time, I'm hoping  
to hear about it so I can fix it.  It would be better if someone else  
took over management of the SCONS build system in the long run.

Greg,

The latest changes in CVS look good to us (getting rid of RAD_COMPAT, and
adding timegm.c and fixing the mismatched quotes on raycalls.c).

Just to confirm we used Scons 1.3.0 and gcc 3.4.5 to build

We'll do a test build in the morning with the nightly snapshot.

Thanks, Pally.

I don't know what to do about most of this, as I don't understand the  
SCONS build system Schorsch developed.  I did remove the outdated  
links to the zip archives from radiance-online.org.  I would have  
liked to update these, but I don't know where they are supposed to get  
built or why they are not.

Regarding the problems with Radiance4R0.tar.gz, this file does not  
have the since-release changes to the HEAD, but the idea always is to  
drop the HEAD on top of whatever you have and update it that way, so I  
see nothing to do there.  I have copied the 4R0 sources and libraries  
over to radiance-online, but I'm afraid it's a bit of a mess right  
now.  The scripts aren't computing the correct patches, and a number  
of other things are broken there as no one is maintaining that website  
at the moment.  (The usual resource allocation issues.)

On your 2nd issue below, I am looking at Sconscript and I see  
clockface.hex and surf.cal mentioned only once, so maybe this has  
already been fixed?  As I said, I don't really understand this build  
system.  If you can be more specific about which lines you had to  
change, that would be helpful.

I don't know what to say or do about your 3rd issue, as there could be  
any number of things going wrong, and no way for me to tell from here.

Best,
-Greg
