Yes, I compiled under 10.5 (Leopard) this time.  Perhaps there's a way  
to back-link it to a version that's supported on earlier OS releases?   
(Let's this discussion to the dev list.)

The 10.4 libraries are in Xcode 3.1.4 in /Developer/SDKs/ 
MacOSX10.4u.sdk/usr/X11R6/lib/.  But the X11 shared library version  
also seems to be the same in Mac OS 10.4 and 10.5, so I'm puzzled.

Subject: [Radiance-dev] invalid picture on Windows
Message-ID: <89355c0f1003290325o540e587s22431dff268c97ed@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all, especially Greg.

I'm currently working on a Python version of falsecolor. The script
uses pcomb, psign and pcompos just like the original falsecolor
script. As always it works fine on Mac/Unix but Windows need further
care:

The images I get look all right to me but when I try to open them in
ximage (or the Windows equivalent) I get the message that the image is
not a valid file format. It seems to be related to the resolution
string. However that is present and the image basically is created by
pcompos.

My wild guess is that the information in the head with all it's back
slashes and quoting interferes with the format of the image file. If
that was the case I could remove the offending lines if I could
identify them.

It's also entirely possible that the binary data of the image gets
messed up in the last step. I tried to keep the default output to
stdout, so I have to read the image data from the pcompos and write it
to stdout. That works on Unix but I'm not sure about Windows.

You can find 2 sample picture files as "attachments" at the end of this site:

http://sites.google.com/site/tbleicher/radiance/falsecolor2

"fc_mac.hdr" was created on a Mac, "fc_win.hdr" on Windows. The images
have no relation to the web-site, but it's the easiest way for me to
upload these two tiny files.

I hope someone can make sense out of this.

Regards,
Thomas

Hi Thomas,

I had a quick look at your output, and it appears that the header is  
being written with '\r\n' at the end of each line rather than the  
expected '\n' alone.  This causes problems especially for the  
resolution string.  The pcompos program (and most others in Radiance)  
set binary mode before writing any output.  Somehow, your script is  
bypassing this step, but I didn't have a look at it and don't know  
Python, anyway, so probably couldn't be much help.

Thanks Greg.

I made a few more tests and it turns out that the same image data
written directly to a file works fine. The problem is apparently
introduced when I write to stdout.

The '\r\n' vs '\n' makes sense because that's where Python insists on
taking control and doing the right thing for the platform. I have to
figure out how to stop that.

Thanks,
Thomas

Thanks, Jack.  Any idea how portable Linux binaries are?  Does it make  
sense to share them with others on the main site?

Hi Greg,

I think they are relatively portable. In our typical environment, I 
normally compile on the old Fedore Core 5 server, but then run on a 
variety of Linux installations with the binaries served via NFS. I would 
be happy to tar the latest compiles and upload them somewhere if that 
would be a help.

-Jack

You could just create a backport of the official Debian packages. Guess its even
possible to use an Ubuntu PPA for that. If there is enough interest, I would
build the packages, too, but I need to know for which architecture and which
Ubuntu version.


Cheers,

Bernd
