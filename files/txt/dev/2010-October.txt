Subject: [Radiance-dev] Compiling Radiance 4.0 HEAD on Windows
Message-ID: <AANLkTimAYUfftX64xfRaRWfqWvDegWWnTo4c3kbZPQ0C@mail.gmail.com>

Today I succeeded in compiling Radiance 4.0 HEAD snapshot on Windows.
I had to make to following modifications to make it work:

*Gendaylit*
To make Gendaylit compile I had to add the following line in:
ray\src\gen\SConscript under the section PROGS = (
*('gendaylit',   Split('gendaylit.c sun.c',), ['rtlamps']),

*I changed the following line in: ray\src\common\SConscript*
*RTLAMPS = Split('''fropen.c rexpr.c lamps.c''')*+ [getlibpath]*

*Dctimestep*
To make dctimestep compile I had to add the following line to:
ray\src\common\SConscript under the section # build libraries*:
rtall = env.StaticLibrary(target=radlib('rtall'), source=ALL)**
*
I changed in ray\src\util\SConscript
('dctimestep', ['dctimestep.c'],
    *['rtall'])*

(I think that including all library functions for dctimestep probably is way
to much, but I don't know the minimal set to include. This way dctimestep
compiles fine.)

Another problem I ran into:

When compiling tmapluv.c the compiler complained about a variable
declaration that was already declared elsewhere.
tmapluv.c includes tiffio.h, which inturn (on Windows) includes windows.h,
which includes windef.h
In windef.h the the following declaration is made: typedef unsigned char
BYTE
This declaration gives problems with tmapluv.c where BYTE is also declared.

As a workaround I commented typedef unsigned char BYTE out in windef.h.
After that the compiler compiles tmapluv.c
After that the compiles continues, but very soon fails again I then removed
the comments from windef.h and the compiler finally finisches building
Radiance.

Question: is it possible to change the declaration of BYTE in tmapluv.c or
tell the compiler to not include windef.h without producing errors? (I am
not a programmer, so I didn't dare mess with it myself)

For compilation I used:
Radiance 4.0 + latest snapshot of the HEAD archive
MinGW with gcc 4.5.0
Phyton 2.7 + scons 1.3.1
compiler optimalisations: -O3 -march=native (for a core2duo)

I hope this is helpfull.

Best Regards,

Guy

Hi Guy,

Thanks very much for these changes -- what happens if you change the include order in tmapluv.c to put "tiffio.h" above "tmprivat.h"?  I think this might resolve the conflict.

Cheers,

Hi Greg,

Thanks! That worked + the solution was easier than I thought it could
possibly be!
I also had to do the same trick on tmaptiff.c (put tiffio.h above tmprivat.h)
and on tmapcolrs.c I had to move rtprocess.h also to be also above tmprivat.h

After these changes compiling went like a charm.

Best Regards.

Guy

(No idea how to reply on a message on the mailing list, I hope this works)

Great!

Can someone else verify Guy's suggested changes to the SConscript files.  I still have no idea how any of Schorsch's build system is supposed to work, so I'm relying on the mailing list for recommended changes.

Cheers,
-Greg

Hi,

I've managed to install latest HEAD Radiance in Windows 7, after changes
suggested by Guy.
All Radiance programs are compiled correctly.

General procedure for installation I use, is the one described on
Francesco's Wiki page
How to compile Radiance using the MinGW tools and
Scons<http://www.bozzograo.net/radiancewiki/doku.php?id=how_to_compile_radiance_using_the_mingw_tools_and_scons>

So when Radiance site is updated, notes about compilation procedure should
be put on the site and also Windows installation file (for those who don't
want to compile files manually).

Cheers,
Marija

Hello,

Thanks for trying. And I am glad that everything compiled correctly,
however:

For Gendaylit you also need a library file called: 'perezlum.cal'

I added this also to ray\scr\gen\SConscript the line should be:
LIBFILES = Split('illum.cal rev.cal skybright.cal glaze1.cal glaze2.cal
perezlum.cal')

This way the file perezlum.cal is also copied when doing a scons install and
Radiance will be able to interpreted and use the output of Gendaylit.

Best Regards,

Guy

Hi,

One more note:
platform/*.cfg files should be updated so that installation paths aren't
"c:\radiance3.6" or so.

For example next can be changed:
[install]
RAD_BASEDIR:   c:\radiance4.0
RAD_BINDIR:    bin
RAD_RLIBDIR:   lib
RAD_MANDIR:    man

+
after installation user has to set RAYPATH environment variable to Radiance
libraries' path.
Maybe it can be done from Scons script (if somebody knows how it can be
done).

Subject: [Radiance-dev] BRTF measurements & some thoughts
Message-ID: <201010200500.o9K50x3S014561@mta2.lbl.gov>

Hi all,

since the Radiance 2010 workshop CD, in which it was planned to be 
added, seems still in the making, and in light of Andy McNeil's nicely 
done and informative three-phase tutorial, it might be worthwhile to 
mention that the workshop talk on 
bidirectional-reflection-transmission-data (BRTF, BSDF, BTDF, etc) 
basics, measurement and modelling had already been put at 
http://www.pab-opto.de/radiance/pab-brtf-talk.web.pdf . It gives some 
compact summary from solid angle to BRTF, some basics on measurements 
and some thoughts based on previous experience with Radiance BRTF models.

For those who are primarily concerned about how to get measured BRTF 
into Radiance at all, LBL's newly introduced, matrix based approach is 
certainly a big step forward, that is vital to handle measured BRTF + 
Radiance in a general, project oriented, way.

For folks who endeavour to explore the BRTF world closer, and without 
going into too much detail here, there still seems good reason to 
consider a matrix based approach as not quite optimal for many of the 
most interesting materials. For the entertainment of the curious, 
reasons are given in the last 10 pages or so of the talk. Funny bit to 
mention: Both views are based on the same data generating measurement 
gonio-photometer (http://www.brtf.info/?d=/gonio-photometer).
Whether or not this will influence any further and/or additional ways of 
getting BRTF data into the Radiance simulation program in an adaptive 
and sleek way, with less  steps on the user-side, is to be seen. 
Technically, there are one or two fairly major programming tweaks to 
this, and both are inside the current rendering core code.

happy rendering,
feedback appreciated

Peter
