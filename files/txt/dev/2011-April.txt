Subject: [Radiance-dev] Problem compiling: drand48() not implemented in
	Windows
Message-ID: <BANLkTikXTs0uj65RyzA8xZtp6C_Vchy-ag@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Greg,

I have a problem compiling the latest HEAD in Windows.
I think this is because drand48() as used in bsdf.c is not implemented in
Windows/MinGW.

Is there a way to fix this?

Best Regards,

Guy

Hi Guy,

I'll fix this in the HEAD.  Meanwhile, you can put the following near the beginning of bsdf.c:

#define drand48()	(rand()*(1./MAX_RAND))

Cheers,
-Greg

Forgive my failing memory.  That should have been:

#define drand48()	(rand()*(1./RAND_MAX))

Looks like you'll need the same define in hilbert.c as well.

Cheers,
