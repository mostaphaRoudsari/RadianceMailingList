Hi!

There used to be a modified implementation of Radiance using MPI. I 
never used it, and it was based on a release that is pretty much 
outdated by now. The code modifications together with a paper titled 
"MPI-parallelized Radiance on SGI CoW and SMP" were published by Roland 
Koholka, Heinz Mayer and Alois Goller in 1999.

Most critical tools in Radiance supports coordinated processing on 
multiple cores by now. This is clearly aiming at platforms providing 
several CPUs/cores per node, not at SIMD. I am not aware of any attempt 
to port the code to GPUs or other specialized cores.

Cheers, Lars.

If -g is given as the last argument to the gensky command, a bus error 
or segmentation fault results.  That is:
  gensky 3 31 10:00 -g -c
works, but
  gensky 3 31 10:00 -c -g
fails.

That's because -g is expecting an argument (the ground reflectance).  If you give "-c" after, it probably calls atof("-c") which returns 0.

In general, Radiance doesn't have very paranoid argument checking.  If you don't give a legal command line, many Radiance programs just muddle through (or crash if they try reading past the last argument).  The exceptions to this are the rendering programs and a few utilities that call badarg() to check command argument types.

So is the default never used?  Or only when -g is not given?

Huh?  You get the default value if you *don't* specify a -g option.  If you use -g 0.30, you would get a ground reflectance of 30% instead of the default 20%.

Make sense?

The default rfl value for -g is used when -g is not given. That's the
definition of default, isn't it? =8-)

Greg is saying that -g needs an argument, for the ground refl. It's not an
on/off switch.

BTW, the default value for -g is not printed in the manpage, but it's 20%
(you can find it in gensky.c, and Axel Jacobs mentions this in his
rtcontrib tutorial, I believe).

Ooof!  Something really weird happens when I run:
  gensky 6 21 10:30 -g -c

Not sure what it does, but it includes a sun.

Time to rerun some simulations...

Subject: [Radiance-dev] Fix for compilation with gcc >=4.5
Message-ID: <4D5EA558.4080107@bzed.de>

Hi,

building radiance fails with gcc >=4.5 with
rhdobj.c:221:15: error: storage size of 'neighlist' isn't constant

which is due to the fact that using a define like
#define NAZI		((int)(PI/2.*NALT+.5))
to define the size of an array is not allowed - gcc 4.5 implements various
details of the standard stricter than versions before.

Attached patch fixes that, not sure if it is the best way to handle it - I
didn't check if NAZI or NALT will be redfined somewhere. The issue should be
fixed in some way, though.

Cheers,

Bernd

I've imported the CVS into git and setup a cronjob to keep it updated.

gitweb: http://git.recluse.de/?p=radiance/radiance.git;a=summary
git clone git://git.recluse.de/radiance/radiance.git


I'll add a repository with integrated aux files, too - but I'm not exactly sure
on how to do that yet.


Cheers,

 Bernd

Thanks Bernd, easily fixed.  (Unfortunate choice of constant name...)

Cheers,

Interesting--I would have thought that was a constant, since the value 
can be calculated at compile time.  But then, it is asking a lot of the 
compiler to provide results consistent at run and compile times in that 
case.  In The Old Days, I suppose a compiler would have just cavalierly 
ignored the issue, in the same way compilers assume that computer 
arithmetic is associative and commutative.
