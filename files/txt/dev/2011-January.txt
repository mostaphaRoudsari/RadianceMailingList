Hi,
I wanted to get some information on how parallel rendering is implemented in Radiance. For example, does it support OpenMP, MPI or both? Will it take advantage of SIMD if available? any pointers to design or architecture documentation would be very helpful.

Hi Bruce,

There is the parallel rendering chapter in "Rendering with Radiance," and the following short write-up:

	http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/Notes/parallel.html

As with most of the rest of Radiance, add-on libraries are avoided, so no OpenMP, MPI, etc. is used.  Also, making ray-tracing work with SIMD is notoriously difficult, so parallelization is course-grained.

I can e-mail you the parallel rendering chapter if you don't have the book.

Cheers,
-Greg

Thanks Greg, I would appreciate if you could mail the chapter. I'll order the book, but I'd like to look at porting Radiance to a compute node architecture machine, e.g. Blue Gene.

Dear Randolph,

I think this bug-report should be send to:
http://www.debian.org/Bugs/Reporting or Bernd Zeimetz (who seems to be the
maintainer of the Debian
package).<http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?maint=bzed%40debian.org>

I found this link on:
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?pkg=radiance;dist=unstable
http://packages.debian.org/sid/radiance

Indeed, and the best way would be to send a bug report using reportbug to ensure
it won't be forgotton.

But I'm building a fixed package right now and it will go into Debian unstable
soon. If there is a really urgend reason to include these files into Debian
Squeeze please let me know, but I guess it should be fine to leave the package
as it is.

Cheers and thanks,

Bernd

I have the pinebark file now called pinebark.hdr, it's the reference that
need changing from pinebark.pic.

The reference to pinebark.pic is in sapling.oct and tree.oct.  I'm not
sure how to regenerate them, perhaps the easiest action is binary edit?
Or avoid the bug with a pinebark.pic link.

It was a bit of a pain, but I managed to regenerate the sapling.oct and tree.oct files.  The question now is, where do I put them?

Cheers,
