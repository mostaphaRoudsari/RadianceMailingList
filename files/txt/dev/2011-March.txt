Is there any reason src/px/tiff is missing from HEAD? Or am I 
doing it wrong?

Hi Mark,

For historical and bandwidth reasons, the ray/src/px/tiff directory is part of the overlay, so you have to unpack the HEAD onto an existing directory tree to have everything.

Cheers,
-Greg

Ahhh, yes. I was hoping to skip that step.

Are the current standard libtiff packages still incompatible with 
Radiance?

Hi Mark,

Your regular libtiff may work, or it may not.  It's difficult to check status on all the versions of libtiff running around out in the world, which is why I include it in the auxiliary files image.

Best,
-Greg

libtiff in Debian works perfectly well with radiance.
