This post really belongs on the developer's list, so I'm cross-posting.  Please subscribe to that if you haven't already and respond there.

You should not compile rvu if you have no output device to use with it.  You can take it out of the dependencies in the src/rt/Rmakefile, and avoid the problem that way.

Cheers,
-Greg

Subject: [Radiance-dev] Running psign from compiled HEAD
Message-ID: <E35477F1A321144D897D44CCAAFF202C0E2C22ABC7@AD-MAILBOX01.aau.dk>



Hi list,

About 3 weeks ago I downloaded and compiled the HEAD version of RADIANCE. Compilation (under Cygwin) was smooth (I initially tried to avoid installing X for Cygwin but compiling RADIANCE without X support proved to be more problematic than I was willing to go through, so I installed the X packages and compiled RADIANCE in a matter of minutes).

Here comes my "observation" or input to this list.

When I started running some old bash scripts (developed and used extensively under an older installation on another machine) I noticed that I could no longer use psign. In one of the bash scripts I am (mis-)using psign to provide me with a .hdr image of a certain resolution with all pixel values set at unity (or rather at 0.996 when checking the values with HDRShop).

The problem turned out to be that the helvet.fnt file was not part of the HEAD tar, and psign uses that file ...

Just an observation. I fixed MY problem by copying the file from the other computer.

Best,
Claus
