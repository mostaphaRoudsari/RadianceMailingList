Message-ID: <A7E25FADF831E94DBBD5904D7E584865071347@GL-EXC-01.iesve.com>

I was building Ogre3D yesterday (cross platform 3D engine) & was amazed at how easy it was to build.
Their implementation of CMake (http://cmake.org/cmake/project/about.html ) made everything so ridiculously easy I was thinking there must be some sort of "gotcha" coming but if there is, I've yet to find it.
As build & release engineering is one of my (many) roles I got to thinking about CMake & the first thing which popped into my head was how much better it would make building Radiance if implemented (especially on Windows as using Scons + MinGW isn't the best experience in my opinion).
Has anyone taken a look at this yet & if so how far did you get with it?

Hi Palbinder,

Funny you should ask. At NREL we have been working on exactly that, a
Cmake build/dashboard system for cross platform building of Radiance. The
project is nearly complete, and Greg Ward has folded in the changes
necessary to make it work. We plan to go live with a support page on our
OpenStudio website (openstudio.nrel.gov) that will include links to binary
installers for Windows, Mac and Linux, as well as instructions on how to
add your own machines to the dashboard. The more people add machines to
the dash, the more robust the testing environment becomes, since each
machine can be configured to grab the HEAD release, build and run some
tests of the binaries. At the moment the test suite is not very robust,
but it at least attempts to exercise the core components of Radiance
(oconv, rtrace, rpict, rtcontrib, genskyvec, dctimestep, xform). More
tests can be added anytime, and as I said the more diverse the member
systems, the better the quality of the test results.

A side bonus of the Radiance Dashboard project is that we now have a
Qt-based version of rvu, that will run on all three major platforms -- as
in, we will finally have a Windows rvu!

I hope to announce this project soon. I also gave a presentation on the
project at the Radiance Workshop in August:

Cheers,

let me know if you would like to have OpenStudio being packaged for Debian - as
you are using CMake it should be pretty easy!

Cheers,

Hi Bernd,

Thanks for the offer!  Though thanks to CMake, we actually already provide Debian packages for OpenStudio.  Makes installation very convenient.

Hi,

would you be interested to maintain them in Debian directly? I could review your
packaging and sponsor the necessary uploads.

Cheers,

Bernd

Thanks Bernd! 

I'll put you in touch with our CMake guru offline and you guys can sort this out. 

Thanks again,

Rob

Hi folks,

as small follow-up on the GPU/Open-CL topic from July 2010:

http://repository.tudelft.nl/view/ir/uuid%3A4a5be464-dc52-4bd0-9ede-faefdaff8be6/

has a  January 2011 master thesis on "Unbiased physically based 
rendering on the GPU" which seems to cover some nice details.
