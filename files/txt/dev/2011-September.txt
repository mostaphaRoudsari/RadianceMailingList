Hi,

Great news:

Intel has updated it's C compiler. The Intel compiler version 12 Update 6 is
able to compile and run Radiance.
I double checked this time, to make sure no other compiler was accidentally
used.

The performance of the Intel compiler is worse than the gcc compiler 4.5.2.

But Intel does update it's compiler often and also provides some great
guides:

- A guide to vectorization with Intel C++ Compilers (With a chapter: Let the
compiler help you to help the compiler to vectorize)

- Quick-Reference Guide to Optimization with Intel Compilers version 12

Great!

Do you mean it takes longer to compile, or that Radiance runs more 
slowly compiled by icc?

Cool.  Maybe I can break loose some time to actually work on this in a 
few months.

Radiance runs more slowly compiled by icc.
The rpict time of gcc 4.5.2 is around 17 minutes 45 seconds and
the rpict time of icc V12 Update 6 is 20 minutes.

The binaries (elf files) produced by the Intel compiler are 1 MB which is
twice the size of the binaries produced by gcc.

Another idea is to post a message on an Intel forum, informing them about
gcc's better performance, they seem interested in this kind of information.
Maybe Intel can learn from gcc and improve their own compiler.

What level of optimization did you use with icc?

Randolph,

I just added the data to the Benchmark page. He used "-O3 -xHost"

It's interesting, out of curiosity I copied the benchmark results from Mark's page into Excel and did some sorting. There are a good number of 3.0 GHz CPU results. At a glance without any real technical analysis it looks like the processor cache has a more significant impact on benchmark performance than CPU clock speed.

Christopher,

I expect the bus speed will also be important.
