I am about to compile the Radiance head source so I include the latest
patches to genBSDF. Is this going to create any other errors I should be
aware of?

Thanks,
Tim

Hi Tim,

I'm not sure what you're concerned about.  There are no known bugs in the current source tree, other than the unknown issue mentioned earlier with rcontrib that I'm still waiting on.

Cheers,
-Greg

Hi Greg,

Thanks for the update. I was worrying about rcontrib actually. I think I'll
just use upgrade and use rtcontrib until the rcontrib is deemed fully
tested. I should have thought of that sooner.  Sorry to spam the whole list
with this.

Tim
