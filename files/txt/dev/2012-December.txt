Hi,

     I have downloaded "Standard Windows one-click installer: radiance-4.2.a-win32.exe" , but i don't know how to run Qt-based rvu on Windows Xp.

Best Regards,
MZ

(This probably belongs on ?general, rather than ?dev?)

The Qt-based rvu is located with all your other Windows Radiance programs, usually c:\Program Files\Radiance\bin. You can double-click the rvu.exe file and load an octree from there, or from the command line you can just type "rvu your_model.oct".

I am working on updated installers this week as well, so stay tuned for an update announcement.
