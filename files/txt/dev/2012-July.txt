Hi,

I just experienced again that strange problem with Version.c from latest
head. How is the content of this file actually generated? Mine contains
the string content after running makeall install, but not the c-code
around. I manually solved the problem by wrappin the string. Still I
wonder why this is needed. Happened on a Debian 6.0.5 system today.

Cheers, Lars.

Hi Lars,

In the legacy build system, Version.c is built by make using "verscript.ed" called by Rmakefile.  I don't know how it's supposed to be built in the cmake system.  Do you have a working copy of the "ed" editor on Debian?

Cheers,
-Greg

P.S.  I am leaving this morning for a week of camping, where I won't be able to get to e-mail.

Hi Lars, 

What is the issue you're having, exactly? AFAIK the CMake build system is
working fine at this point.
