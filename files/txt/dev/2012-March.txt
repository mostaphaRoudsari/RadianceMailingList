So did this ever get any closer to public release?

Also why are Radiance releases not announced on this list? 4.1 was apparently released in November 2011 according to http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/download.html but there's no communication beyond that page I can see (http://www.radiance-online.org/ still mentions version "4R0" on its downloads page).

Hi Palbinder,

Funny you should ask. At NREL we have been working on exactly that, a
Cmake build/dashboard system for cross platform building of Radiance. The
project is nearly complete, and Greg Ward has folded in the changes
necessary to make it work. We plan to go live with a support page on our
OpenStudio website (openstudio.nrel.gov) that will include links to binary
installers for Windows, Mac and Linux, as well as instructions on how to
add your own machines to the dashboard. The more people add machines to
the dash, the more robust the testing environment becomes, since each
machine can be configured to grab the HEAD release, build and run some
tests of the binaries. At the moment the test suite is not very robust,
but it at least attempts to exercise the core components of Radiance
(oconv, rtrace, rpict, rtcontrib, genskyvec, dctimestep, xform). More
tests can be added anytime, and as I said the more diverse the member
systems, the better the quality of the test results.

A side bonus of the Radiance Dashboard project is that we now have a
Qt-based version of rvu, that will run on all three major platforms -- as
in, we will finally have a Windows rvu!

I hope to announce this project soon. I also gave a presentation on the
project at the Radiance Workshop in August:

Hi Pally,

Yes, we got closer, but not across the finish line. We are very close,
however. We are working out a subcontract with Kitware (the CMake guys)
right now to provide support to wrap the project up. I apologize for the
delay, but I assure you we are very close to making the announcement.

Greg will have to weigh in on the Radiance release announcement question.
I thought he did announce releases on radiance-general?

I'm not on radiance-general so I likely missed it.

Good to hear the progress with the CMake release is close. I can't wait to give it a go if it means never having to deal with Scons ever again! No apologies needed =)

Hi Pally,

I did put together a 4.1 release on radsite, but have not updated radiance-online as yet.  There are several reasons for this.  To name a few:

A)  I am waiting for some compiled binaries for systems other than Mac OS X.  No one has offered any as yet, although I sent out an informal request to the usual suspects.  I may be able to produce one myself using VMWare and Lubuntu, at least for Linux.

B)  Related to A, I have been hoping for a working Windows release from Rob G. & Co., and they've been making progress as he says.

C)  The HEAD version on radiance-online is essentially the same as 4.1 with a few bug fixes, so that's generally preferred unless binaries are desired.  (See A.)

D)  The folks at LBNL keep saying they want to sort out the confusion between radsite and radiance-online, at least as far as releases go, and I keep hoping for movement on that and being disappointed.  My ability with HTML is limited to minor tweaks and changes, and I don't have the time or the chops to do a major cleanup like the one needed.

So, those are my excuses.  I could copy what's on radsite to radiance-online and take off the links to the other 4.0 binaries, but would that really help anyone?

-Greg

When this thing is done, we (NREL) will be offering binary downloads for
all three platforms in some form or fashion, that hopefully LBNL could
link to. (?) I don't think .rpm or .deb will happen, but at least there'll
be a tarball of ./bin and ./lib for Linux users. There will be a Mac
"package" (disk image with installer), and for Win there will be an NSIS
installer.

It seems NREL does already have binaries for all three platforms for
download!

Or is it not finished yet?

Uhm, yeah, you weren't supposed to see those. =8-\

Those are actually incomplete. If you can, please hold off until the project is officially announced as complete. I really think it will be a matter of weeks.

Debian testing has 4.1. Rebuilding that for other Debian based distros is easy -
if somebody is interested I could upload a backport to Squeeze to
backports.debian.org - but please let me know that you are interested :)

Subject: [Radiance-dev] Falsecolor Problem
Message-ID: <CAL-bo5GvKRq+UfsdorVzdxktH8Ro3kFmFO75nxGa_VGXR2HCqg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Axel, hi list,

I just came across a strange behaviour of falsecolor:
the last version of falsecolor.pl (as of January 18) does not show the last
digit of the
lowest value in the legend. I just wanted to get a scale -s 100 -n 10 (i.e.
5, 15, ..., 95)
and here the last line "5" (the only digit in this case) is removed.

I don't work with perl and thus don't really have a clue what's going on.
However,
replacing the lines 280-282

    open PSIGN, "| psign -s -.15 -cf 1 1 1 -cb 0 0 0 -h $sheight > $slabpic";
    print PSIGN "$text";
    close PSIGN;

with the lines as in the version before (v. 2.5)

    $cmd = "echo '$text' | psign -s -.15 -cf 1 1 1 -cb 0 0 0";
    $cmd .= " -h $sheight > $slabpic";
    system $cmd;


solves the problem...

Cheers,
David

Hi David,

Thank you for spotting this bug. It will be fixed in the next HEAD. The 
bug was caused by a missing new-line in the print statement on line.281:

print PSIGN"$text\n";

It has now been reverted to the older, simpler version which you found 
in v 2.5, where a system call was used instead.

Cheers

Axel

I (heart) Perl.

Not.
