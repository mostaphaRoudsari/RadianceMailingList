Does this mean the Radiance CMake environment is available for general consumption?

Hi David,

I am trying to sort out two other issues with the Windows binaries, but I can push out a new Windows installer tomorrow morning for you with this fix. We can talk offline if you want to talk about getting up and running with CMake, too.

Hi Greg, Rob,

thanks a lot for the quick responses and for the fix!

However, I need to wait for the new NREL-binaries to use the fixed version (or maybe finally step into the CMake thing to get the Windows bins compiled by myself... ;-) ).

Cheers,
David

Hi David,

I found the problem, and can figure out how to fix it.  The code assumes that exponents have two digits only, which is still true on most Unix machines.  I guess they're making room for "long double's" (128-bit IEEE float) and don't have different code for that than the "regular" doubles.

I will check in a fix later today -- thanks so much for spotting this.

Cheers,
-Greg

It does indeed, Pally. I just announced I on radiance-general, and was
planning an update on how to use the Cmake system on your own system, to
be posted to tis dev list. In the meantime, you can check out what we have
on offer at:

https://openstudio.nrel.gov/getting-started-developer/getting-started-radia
nce

There are still a couple of issues (typically Windows issues) cropping up
(like the one David discovered recently) that Greg is actively fixing and
pushing into HEAD, but we are currently updating the HEAD installers every
two weeks. So, for the latest-greatest Radiance, you'll want to get up to
speed with Cmake.

Excellent Rob, I'm a bit busy with an impending software release right now but I'll definitely have a go later this month.

Thanks for all the hard work (and I really should get on the radiance-general list as I seem to miss a lot of announcements only being on here).

My pleasure Pally (actually it was (is) a giant PITA, and Greg Ward, Axel

And yeah, -general and -dev are a package deal, you need to monitor both

I'm sure it's appreciated though Rob =)
Certainly for anyone like myself who has to build Radiance on Windows as trying to use the old Scons system was also a massive PITA but at least this is something which can be maintained and is cross platform.

Signing myself up to Radiance-general now ;)

Again thanks to everyone involved for all the time, effort, blood, sweat, tears & anything else required to get this up & running.

Hi James,

Your reply-to was fine, this thread started in -general. As to your
problem, I will pass this along to the Kitware guys to try and find a fix.
You are the first person to test this on Solaris for us, so thanks much!

Greg, I am getting a release Windows build posted to the site today, and
would like to at least address those two user questions in -general. But
yeah I agree, after that, we should move these discussions to -dev.

Subject: [Radiance-dev] Cross platform Radiance installers,

Message-ID: <CAFXPCRYPgrpdPKvUMu5vQ+YAJY7j+ZcyKDujcwKsk3pXEiRVXA@mail.gmail.com>

Great job! I really like the new rvu on Windows.

I just tried it on Windows 7 64 bits

A few remarks:

In rvu

-selecting load view (file viewpoint.vp) contents: -vp -.5 -5 1.15 -vd 0.5
5 0 doesn't set the viewparameters (it doesn't do anything).

After manually setting a view
-selecting load view and pressing cancel 'resets' the view and rvu
recalculates from a random viewpoint, doing it again (select load view and
press cancel) goes back to the manually entered view before and
recalculates.

-selecting file -> Load .rif doesn't do anything.

-selecting parameter: some values could be expained a bit more, for example
te first tab ambient has in the first column value: 0 0 0 (I don't know
which values are required).

It looks like it is possible to set the environmental path on Windows
directly in the NSIS installer:

http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Environmental_Variables:_append,_prepend,_and_remove_entries
(The old MnGW installer offered at: http://www.bozzograo.net/radiance/ did
also set the environment variables).

One question: are you sure you want to include rpiece in the
Windows installer? Since for Windows at compile-time the only message
possible by rpiece is the one about the missing NFS-manager.
To get rpiece working on Windows one would have rewrite (at least) the part
about file locking since Windows does this differently from other OS.
(It would be great to see rpiece working on Windows too!).

Best Regards,

Guy

Hi Guy,

Thanks for the feedback! I'm running out the door to catch a bus, but I will review this tonight. Thanks especially to the NSIS pointer on env paths. I knew it was possible, just hadn't had time to look into it, so thanks for the pointer. The rvu bugs seem serious, I have to admit I haven't tested that extensively on Windows. And you're right, rpiece should be taken out of the Windows package for now; that's an easy fix. Making rpiece Windows-compatible, now that's a different story. ;)

Hi Greg,

the last mgf2inv update fixed the problem with the tree digit exponents.
However, on Windows (thanks again Rob for providing the new binaries!)
the normals are still messed up -- see below.

The strange thing is that using the Windows binaries normals are printed
whereas in Linux the normals are not printed at all.

The output in Windows is:

*DEF ceil_fac_001 Group {
  Separator {
    USE ceil_mat
    Coordinate3 {
      point [ -2.000000000e+000 +4.500000000e+000 +2.853170182e+000,
              -1.500000000e+000 +4.500000000e+000 +3.000000000e+000,
              -1.500000000e+000 +5.000000000e+000 +2.544315366e+000,
              -2.000000000e+000 +5.000000000e+000 +2.397485548e+000 ]
    }
    Normal {
      vector [ +0.000 +0.000 +0.0-1.500000000e+000 +4.500000000e+000
+3.000000000e+000,
               +0.000 +0.000 +0.0-1.500000000e+000 +5.000000000e+000
+2.544315366e+000,
               +0.000 +0.000 +0.0-2.000000000e+000 +5.000000000e+000
+2.397485548e+000,
               +0.000 +0.000 +0.000 ]
    }
    IndexedFaceSet {
      coordIndex [ 0, 1, 2, 3 ]
      normalIndex [ 0, 1, 2, 3 ]
    }
  }
}
*
It seems the vlist[] is corrupt under Win because in line 546 of mgf2inv.c
the strcmp is
nonzero. To me it seems that from the the second vertex on the vertices are
written 3 bytes
left of where they should be -- these could be just the bytes that Win (or
any system with
3 digit exponents) needs more?!

All in all it's probaly the VFLEN that is correct for a 2 digit exponent
(72 = VSEPPOS (50) +
space (1) + len(VZVECT) (20) + len(\0) (1)) but not for a 3 digit exponent.

Cheers,
David

Any specific reason why you're using NSIS to build your installer rather than WiX? -> http://wixtoolset.org/
WiX should be supported by CMake (it was last time I checked).

Message-ID: <CAL-bo5FAESTz5rZTQxV5V6uuixJXQLbqQJh7RRiw5VrcR-hM=g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list, hi Greg,

I have a question concerning the BSDF "up-vector".
For e.g. a facade-mounted fenestration system the definition of the vector
is clear.
But what, if I have a BSDF defining the material properties and use this
BSDF to
simulate the BSDF of a daylighting system (i.e. curved specular lamellae)?

The comment in m_bsdf.c says that the "up-vector" together with the surface
normal
defines the local coordinate system. How exactly is that done??
Unfortunately I did
not have time yet to dig deeper into the BSDF-code to find that out...

Cheers,
David

The code is pretty simple.  So long as the "up vector" is not parallel to the surface normal, it is used to orient the 0-degree azimuth position by projecting it into the plane of the surface normal at the ray intersection point.  Make sense?

Thanks Pally,
