Subject: [Radiance-dev] Minor build issue with gendaylit using Visual Studio
Message-ID: <A7E25FADF831E94DBBD5904D7E5848653521BC@GL-EXC-01.iesve.com>

Gendaylit fails to compile with the following error:

1>..\..\..\src\gen\gendaylit.c(186): error C2065: 'M_PI' : undeclared identifier

To use Math Constants such as M_PI in Visual Studio you need to define _USE_MATH_DEFINES -> http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/4hwaceh6.aspx
I added it to the pre-processor definitions in the project settings for gendaylit.c & it builds without error but you could add it in the source itself.
This is using the latest "combined" code from the repository at http://public.kitware.com/gitweb?p=radiance.git

My fault.  For Windows, there needs to be a line:

#define _USE_MATH_DEFINES

before including math.h.  Jan and Wendelin -- please make this addition to your version of gendaylit.c so the problem doesn't come back.  (I had fixed this before the new check-in.)

Thanks for the heads-up, Pally!

thanks Greg and Pally! And sorry that we missed that. we definitely add

Subject: [Radiance-dev] gendaylit 2.3
Message-ID: <521BD204.6040201@gmail.com>

Dear all,

it appears you've had three very interesting and productive days at the 
WS. I am only just catching up with the presentations and videos. 
Amongst the many cool topics, the new v2.3 of gendaylit caught my attention.

As some of you might recall, I ran the old gendaylit (don't remember 
what version) against all EPW files that were then available on the E+ 
web site when I worked on my rtcontrib tutorial.
http://www.jaloxa.eu/resources/radiance/documentation/docs/gendaylit_epw_errors.html
If there had been an executive summary, it would have read "it's a right 
old mess". There are big problems with the quality of the weather data.

I'm re-running this against v2.3 and the latest weather files. It's too 
soon to present any detailed analysis yet (it's taking for ages on my 
computer), but please find below some observations:

a) Below is from 2_asia_wmo_region_2/CHN_Anhui.Tunxi.585310_CSWD.epw

Classic (no -i):
# gendaylit 1 2 17.5 -a 29.72 -o -118.28 -m -120.0 -W 0 6

void brightfunc skyfunc
2 skybright perezlum.cal
0
10 0.00 0.00  0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000  -0.000000 -1.000000 0.000000

This is a dark sky without sun. Return code of 1, but nothing on stderr.

New and improved (-i 60):
# gendaylit 1 2 17.5 -a 29.72 -o -118.28 -m -120.0 -i 60 -W 0 6

void brightfunc skyfunc
2 skybright perezlum.cal
0
10 0.00 0.00  0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000  -0.000000 -1.000000 0.000000

Still a dark sky. Return code of 1, but nothing on stderr.
Maybe the sunset is not within +/- 30 minutes of 17:30?

# gendaylit 1 2 17.2 -a 29.72 -o -118.28 -m -120.0 -W 0 6

void light solar
0
0
3 0.0 0.0 0.0

solar source sun
0
0
4 -0.890913 -0.454035 0.011245 0.533000

void brightfunc skyfunc
2 skybright perezlum.cal
0
10 7.891e-01 2.051e-01 0.636339 -0.630451 0.478351 -0.421145 -0.036172 
-0.890913 -0.454035 0.011245

But it is! Sometime between 17.2 and 17.3 hrs

b) The usage info (eg when run without options and params) does not show 
-i and -s.

c) The old gendaylit used to produce a header just like gensky, with sun 
alti, azi, groundamb etc in it. This was extremely helpful.

d) The new -i option now creates a warning message, and an exit status 
of 1 if the new algorithm kicks in. Is this really a good idea? After 
all, by setting -i, we have actually asked gendaylit to do exactly this. 
Would it not be better to have a few extra header lines with corrected 
time and solar position (possibly even sunrise/sunset for that day)?

e) Greg, could you elaborate why we have two gendaylit now? You 
mentioned this in your talk. The version in HEAD seems to be the 
Fraunhofer one. Where is the one based on Ian Ashdown's implementation? 
I'm a little confused...

f) here is quite a common error with weather files - Positive sun alti, 
but no irradiance:
# gendaylit 9 6 7.5 -a -39.01 -o -174.18 -m -180.0 -i 60 -W 0 0

void brightfunc skyfunc
2 skybright perezlum.cal
0
10 0.00 0.00  0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000  0.960801 0.245763 0.128307

Return code is 1, stderr is
"Solar position corrected at 9 6 7.500
ERROR: Model parameters out of range, skyclearness = -nan"

gensky tells me the alti is 9.0 degrees. This is in New Zealand.

This is not a gendaylit bug, but rather a problem with the Perez model, 
which is only calibrated against Berkeley, CA and Watford, UK data. Is 
there something that can be done about it? There are quite a few such 
problems in many of the weather files.

Thanks for your thoughts. I'll report back when I have more results.

Cheers

Axel

Hi Axel! 

I have but a sec, and there rare others better equipped mentally to answer most of your questions, but really quick:

There still is only one gendaylit, and it is the Fraunhofer code. The other thing we have is Ian Ashdown's Perez sky implementation that Greg used in the new gendaymtx program to generate (usually) annual sky matrices based on the Perez model.

Hi Axel,

thanks for testing out the new version - this is very helpful. And sorry 
if there are still some small bugs in it, we will fix it. I also think 
we will consider your suggestions b), c) and d).
e) was answered by rob.

I forward this email to my colleague Wendelin, who hasn't subscribed to 
the dev list I guess.

We will come back to you soon!

Cheers,

Jan

Rob is correct. I rewrote gendaylit.c in accordance with our internal
software engineering standards and released it as H32_gendaylit on
www.helios32.com. It is fully compatible with gendaylit.c, but with fewer
command-line options because it was developed for use with TMY3 files. For
Radiance users, the Fraunhofer version is appropriate.

Dear all,

it appears you've had three very interesting and productive days at the WS.
I am only just catching up with the presentations and videos. 
Amongst the many cool topics, the new v2.3 of gendaylit caught my attention.

As some of you might recall, I ran the old gendaylit (don't remember what
version) against all EPW files that were then available on the E+ web site

If there had been an executive summary, it would have read "it's a right old
mess". There are big problems with the quality of the weather data.

I'm re-running this against v2.3 and the latest weather files. It's too soon
to present any detailed analysis yet (it's taking for ages on my computer),
but please find below some observations:

This is a dark sky without sun. Return code of 1, but nothing on stderr.

But it is! Sometime between 17.2 and 17.3 hrs

b) The usage info (eg when run without options and params) does not show -i
and -s.

c) The old gendaylit used to produce a header just like gensky, with sun
alti, azi, groundamb etc in it. This was extremely helpful.

d) The new -i option now creates a warning message, and an exit status of 1
if the new algorithm kicks in. Is this really a good idea? After all, by
setting -i, we have actually asked gendaylit to do exactly this. 
Would it not be better to have a few extra header lines with corrected time
and solar position (possibly even sunrise/sunset for that day)?

e) Greg, could you elaborate why we have two gendaylit now? You mentioned
this in your talk. The version in HEAD seems to be the Fraunhofer one. Where
is the one based on Ian Ashdown's implementation? 
I'm a little confused...

f) here is quite a common error with weather files - Positive sun alti, but
no irradiance:
# gendaylit 9 6 7.5 -a -39.01 -o -174.18 -m -180.0 -i 60 -W 0 0

Return code is 1, stderr is
"Solar position corrected at 9 6 7.500
ERROR: Model parameters out of range, skyclearness = -nan"

gensky tells me the alti is 9.0 degrees. This is in New Zealand.

This is not a gendaylit bug, but rather a problem with the Perez model,
which is only calibrated against Berkeley, CA and Watford, UK data. Is there
something that can be done about it? There are quite a few such problems in
many of the weather files.

Thanks for your thoughts. I'll report back when I have more results.

Cheers

Axel

Hi Axel! 

I have but a sec, and there rare others better equipped mentally to answer
most of your questions, but really quick:

There still is only one gendaylit, and it is the Fraunhofer code. The other
thing we have is Ian Ashdown's Perez sky implementation that Greg used in
the new gendaymtx program to generate (usually) annual sky matrices based on
the Perez model.

Hi Axel,

thanks for testing out the new version - this is very helpful. And sorry if
there are still some small bugs in it, we will fix it. I also think we will
consider your suggestions b), c) and d).
e) was answered by rob.

I forward this email to my colleague Wendelin, who hasn't subscribed to the
dev list I guess.

We will come back to you soon!

Cheers,

Jan
