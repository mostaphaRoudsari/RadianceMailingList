Greg I'd completely forgotten about this issue & was reminded by a colleague recently as he was seeing this issue intermittently.
He's provided me an archive which I've uploaded to http://upload.iesve.com/downloads/radiance_issues/ghost_luminaire2.zip
It should contain - Monday.rad, Monday_mod.rad Luminaire Files - DULCET1203WW.* Parameter file - Monday.rdp (with -dt = 0.025 and -dc = 0.95) View file - Monday.rdv Octree file - image5.oct Pic file - image5.pic (with ghost luminaire)

We're running on Windows 7 x64. The radiance code I used to build from source is a few months old (mid-September IIRC) as I haven't had time to re-download & re-run Cmake etc. if there's been any updates since then.

Thanks,

Hi Pally,

I don't know who or what is setting your rendering parameters, but they are not something I would recommend.  The "rad" program is a good way to get sane rendering options if you don't like the defaults.  Setting -dt .25 -dc .35 is causing the strange contours around your light sources as well as numerous other inaccuracies.  You are telling Radiance that you are fine with 25% error in the direct calculation, meaning everything else is worse.

The ghosts you are seeing are due most likely to a glazing surface that extends over your wall surface(s).  I can't tell you for sure because the zip file you uploaded doesn't contain a complete model -- there are many referenced files that are missing.

What system are you using to assemble all this?

-Greg

I can't really tell what's going on because I can't reproduce your strange image with the ghost luminaire.  The ghost doesn't even match the appearance of the luminaires you've defined, so it makes no sense to me.

You should retry with the latest HEAD version to see if it's still happening for you.  If it is, then we have an issue I can investigate further.

Cheers,
-Greg

Greg I'm using the snapshot from http://public.kitware.com/gitweb?p=radiance.git;a=tree which doesn't appear to have been changed since the 15th of September. http://radiance-online.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/?pathrev=MAIN doesn't appear to have tarball generation enabled.

Both images (image5_axel.hdr and axel.hdr) don't show the ghost
luminaires that you have in image5.pic. No idea what's going on.

I also inspected your model in Rhino3d. The surfaces that IESVE
generated can be a bit weird, especially when you don't enable 'inner
volumes'. In your case, the walls at least are good, with no co-planar
surfaces.

Cheers

Axel

Perhaps this link can help:

It's supposed to work on Windows, but maybe it will work for luminaires, too.

(I posted earlier from my personal address, but I don't think I'm actually
subscribed from that one. Apologies if this ends up showing up 2x...)

Hi Pally, 

I can help here. The origin trunk (i.e. "master") on that Kitware git repo
does not refresh the way you might think. Kitware has a ???combined???
branch that actually has the latest HEAD (updated nightly, I believe at
midnight EST). To add this, issue:

"git checkout -t origin/combined"

"git branch" will tell where you are, and what you've got checked out:

hooper:radiance rpg$ git branch
 combined
* master
hooper:radiance rpg$

You can switch between branches with the 'checkout' command:

hooper:radiance rpg$ git checkout combined
Switched to branch 'combined'
hooper:radiance rpg$ git branch
* combined
 master
hooper:radiance rpg$

I work off this combined branch for building current packages (speaking of
which a fresh set of them should go live on the NREL site today). I know
this is confusing, but this is a vestige from when Kitware was doing all
the heavy lifting getting the CMake build system implemented across the
source tree, and making frequent changes.

Anyhow, the takeaway here is if you wish to use the Kitware git repo for
your latest HEAD source, use the combined branch for now!

- Rob

P.S.
I know this is a bit confusing. We will hopefully set up our own (NREL)
git mirror that I'll be able to refresh whenever I need to.

Ah ok I'll try rebuilding using a snapshot of the combined branch & see how I get on.

(I posted earlier from my personal address, but I don't think I'm actually subscribed from that one. Apologies if this ends up showing up 2x...)

Hi Pally, 

I can help here. The origin trunk (i.e. "master") on that Kitware git repo does not refresh the way you might think. Kitware has a ???combined??? branch that actually has the latest HEAD (updated nightly, I believe at midnight EST). To add this, issue:

"git checkout -t origin/combined"

"git branch" will tell where you are, and what you've got checked out:

hooper:radiance rpg$ git branch
 combined
* master
hooper:radiance rpg$

You can switch between branches with the 'checkout' command:

hooper:radiance rpg$ git checkout combined Switched to branch 'combined'
hooper:radiance rpg$ git branch
* combined
 master
hooper:radiance rpg$

I work off this combined branch for building current packages (speaking of which a fresh set of them should go live on the NREL site today). I know this is confusing, but this is a vestige from when Kitware was doing all the heavy lifting getting the CMake build system implemented across the source tree, and making frequent changes.

Anyhow, the takeaway here is if you wish to use the Kitware git repo for your latest HEAD source, use the combined branch for now!

- Rob

P.S.
I know this is a bit confusing. We will hopefully set up our own (NREL) git mirror that I'll be able to refresh whenever I need to.

However I am not able to run the program. kindly help

Alpana,

Unfortunately, Radiance isn't the kind of program that you run by clicking
the icon. Everything is done via the terminal and/or with scripting.
The tutorials under the learn tab should help you get started:

Best,
Andy

Dear Greg,

I was interested in buying the book - 'Rendering with Radiance - The
Art and Science of Lighting Visualization'. The online book stores
marks it out of print. Suggest the possibilities of procurement. i
stay in India.

Best Regards

Alpana
