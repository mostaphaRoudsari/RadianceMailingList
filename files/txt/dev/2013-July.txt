Thanks David! I hit this the other day and thought it was specific to my system. I guess I screwed up the last set of packages. Will fix immediately, thanks again for the heads up.

Hi Rob, hi all,

I just tried the latest version of the NREL Windows binaries and got an error that
already came up a year ago (that's why I'm responding to this thread). Again it
says something about problems with a side-by-side configuration. The last time it
was due to a debug-build instead of a release version - maybe it's the same issue
again??

Cheers,
David

OK, an updated Windows installer with release binaries is now available on the site. Sorry for the goof.

We appreciate all the help with testing and reporting issues! Form here on out, let's move discussion of issues with these NREL offerings or CMake build issues to the -dev list.

Hi Rob,

Very nice to have current Radiance version on Windows.

I've installed binary setup file in Windows and set PATH and RAYPATH environment variables as suggested on web page.
I have few other Radiance installations in Windows (inside Daysim for example), so I've experimented with PATH and RAYPATH variable, and put path to new Radiance installation as first in both variables and I get next message when I try to run any program:

The application has failed to start because its side-by-side configuration is incorrect. Please see the application event log or use the command-line sxstrace.exe tool for more detail.

I also tried to remove all paths related to other Radiance installations from PATH and RAYPATH varialbes, but still getting the same error message.

Any ideas how to solve this?

Thanks in advance,
Marija

Measure-Command in PowerShell would be a much better solution -> http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee176899.aspx

I was planning on making the necessary tweaks to Mark's benchmarks so they run on Windows via PowerShell but alas I never have any time for anything interesting.

I have benchmarked Relux with the Radiance (or 'Raytracer', as they call it now) engine under Windows. This was done with Process Monitor, which is free download from the M$ site:
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-gb/sysinternals/bb896645.aspx

It's not quite the same as the UNIX 'time' command, but saves you sitting there with the old stop watch.

What you do is you launch PM and set up a filter for 'rpict', and/or anything else you wish to benchmark. Now run the benchmark. PM will capture the start and end time of this process. You can export the result to a text file. You still need to work out the runtime:
runtime = end - start.

It's not terribly elegant, but does work.

PM tends to be a little temperamental. I never got it to work on certain machines. It also might crash unexpectedly.

Cheers

Axel

Hi Rob, hi all,

I just tried the latest version of the NREL Windows binaries and got an
error that
already came up a year ago (that's why I'm responding to this thread).
Again it
says something about problems with a side-by-side configuration. The last
time it
was due to a debug-build instead of a release version - maybe it's the same
issue
again??

Cheers,
David

Subject: [Radiance-dev] Mark Stock's benchmark on native Windows Radiance
	(time command)
Message-ID: <CAFXPCRa-bKwDZ4qjmCLYqm_E7VCwPGhE8PWpcx8otu4vofaBhA@mail.gmail.com>

There is a 'time' command in Windows! No need to install anything!
See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIME_(command)

There even is a nice time bat-file on Stackoverflow:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/673523/how-to-measure-execution-time-of-command-in-windows-command-line

To run Mark Stock benchmark on windows you have to:
Step 1:
copy xform.exe and rename it cat.exe
OR
install Mingw which seems to contain a cat.exe

Step2:
create a file called 'options' in the bench4 directory
with this contents:
-pa 1.0 -pj 0.02 -ps 1
-w+ -i- -bv+
-dt 0.050 -dc 0.50 -dj 0.0 -ds 0.250 -dr 1 -dp 512 -dv+
-st 0.150
-ab 4 -ar 128 -ad 1500 -as 500 -aa 0.15 -av 0.0 0.0 0.0 -aw 0
-lw 0.004
-ss 1.0 -lr -10 -u- -pd 0.0

Step3:
Create a .bat file with this contents:
@echo off
echo %time%
obj2mesh -n 15 -r 16384 lens.obj > lens.msh
oconv -f -n 6 -r 16384 materials.rad cube2f.rad > cube2f_instance.oct
oconv -f -n 6 -r 16384 materials.rad cube4f.rad > cube4f_instance.oct
oconv -n 6 -r 16384 materials.rad scene.rad > scene.oct
rpict @viewpoint @options -x 2048 -y 2048 -t 60 -o windows.unf scene.oct
pfilt -1 -e +0 -x /4 -y /4 -r .6 -m .15 windows.unf > windows.pic
ra_bmp windows.pic > windows.bmp
echo %time%
pause

Step 4:
Run the .bat file

If you don't want to calculate the time yourself you can use the .bat file
on Stackoverflow (I haven't tried it yet).

-I believe Greg also mentioned a way to avoid the use of cat in Radiance,
but I didn't understood how. :)

I guess that was all I had to change.

Best Regards, Guy
