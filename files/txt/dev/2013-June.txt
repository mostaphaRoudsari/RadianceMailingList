Randolph, I know you know this, but I thought I'd reply here just to have it in the archive. I use MS VisualStudio Express 2008 (v9) to make the so-called NREL binaries of Radiance, along with CMake.

In addition to MSVC and CMake, users need Qt and libtiff installed if they want the full complement of executables including the Windows rvu.

Thanks.

At the moment, I am downloading VS Express 2010 C++, that being the only
no-charge version MS makes available to Vista users (well, it came with my
workstation.)

OK. Now, which versions of Qt and libtiff do I use? Do I download
the libtiff source and let the cmake build it? Or...? And there are two
Qt sites on the net! It looks like qt-project.org is the one to use, but
then there are more decisions. Since you are using VS 2008, I suppose
you are using Qt 4.8, but what is available to me as a VS 2010 user is
Qt 5.0.2. Do I use the base version or the OpenGL version, or does that
depend on the target platform? 

Enquiring minds, er, nevermind. 

I'm
being reminded all over again why some of the old Bell
Labs/Lucent/Google people don't like shared libraries.

I'm not, but CMake is; that's the beauty of the thing. When you first fire up the CMake GUI on Windoze, it asks you what kind of project files you want to make. All the MSVC options are in there. You pick your version, configure, generate, and done. Then just open MSVC and open the radiance.sln file created by CMake, and you'll see all your targets.

The current version of libtiff is 4.0.3, released in September of 2012,

It may be years out of date, but that installer works. It allows us to build ra_tiff for Windows, and last time I checked on that platform, the executable does what it's supposed to do.

Good, good.  But it does perpetuate whatever bugs were in that fairly old
version of libtiff.  This is not a priority for me--I wrote that up so that
we would have it for reference--but it might be worth looking into in the
future.

Hi Randolph,

You can use the sources included in the auxiliary files, or you can use any distribution of libtiff that has a libtiff/tif_luv.c file dated on or after March 2006.

I tend to compile Radiance against the native libtiff-dev under LINUX. This
only requires a slight mod to three or four lines in the px/Rmake file.
Have never had any problems, but off the top of my head, I reckon ra_tiff
is the only executable that I use which relies on libtiff.

Message-ID: <CA+dqh60koounK2PVvXA=4h_P26o1Wkk+2KY6umy4G1d6vk=L+w@mail.gmail.com>

Dear dev,

One or the other might be interested in this: This year's Summer of
Code has two projects under 'OpenCV' that deal with HDR/RGBE:

http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/projects/list/google/gsoc2013

- High Dynamic Range imaging
The goal of the project is to add full HDR support to openCV. This
includes loading HDR images from popular formats to floating-point
matrices, supporting various tone-mapping techniques and implementing
HDR image creation from a set of bracketed images times with different
enhancements including camera calibration and single-shot HDR images.

- Photometric calibration for imaging devices
This project aims at developing a library for photometric calibration
of imaging devices.Specifically, I would like to implement functions
for the radiometric response calibration, vignetting calibration,
noise level estimation, and the point spread function estimation,
which are essential for computer vision algorithms dealing with
photometric information (i.e. color constancy, High-dynamic range
images, inverse rendering).

Also for the Pythonistas amongst you:
- OpenCV-Python Tutorials

1 - Develop a new tutorials for OpenCV-Python API covering a major
portion of the API (Similar to the existing C++ tutorials). 2 - Extend
Python bindings for the newly added modules and any missing
functionalities. 3 - Fix discovered bugs, missing docs etc on the way.

I messed with Python OpenCV just over a year ago, and got stuck
because the Python API is poorly documented. Also because I didn't
know what I was doing, but I won't mention this here...

Cheers

Axel

Rob,

I simply remove all references to libtiff. This works for me, but I'm
not sure if this is the 'proper' way of doing this. Could somebody
else comment?

Also: I never do anything more exotic than ra_tiff. I equally have to
admit that I don't know what --enable and --disable options libtiff is
compiled with on Debian/Fedora etc.

Cheers

Subject: [Radiance-dev] cmake / VS 2010 Express build problem
Message-ID: <loom.20130627T030508-92@post.gmane.org>

cmake version 2.8.11.1, Visual Studio version Express SP1.

When I go to set up the cmake build (run configure in cmake) I get two
warnings like:

  CMake Warning at C:/Program Files/CMake
2.8/share/cmake-2.8/Modules/InstallRequiredSystemLibraries.cmake:343 (message):
	  system runtime library file does not exist:
	  'MSVC10_REDIST_DIR-NOTFOUND/x86/Microsoft.VC100.CRT/msvcp100.dll'
	Call Stack (most recent call first):
	  CMakeLists.txt:144 (include)

And then a spew of messages like:
    CMake Error at InstallRules/CMakeLists.txt:18 (get_filename_component):
      get_filename_component called with incorrect number of arguments

The warnings are apparently a VS 2010 Express "feature." No idea what to
make of the "incorrect number of arguments" errors.

How do I get this to work?

Got it.

This is a bug, due to missing quotes in InstallRules\CMakeLists.txt.

Lines 18-23 of that file should read:
get_filename_component(qgif_plugin "${QT_QGIF_${qt_plugin_term}_RELEASE}" NAME)

NAME)

Not sure if I have an old version of InstallRules\CMakeLists.txt or if my
configuration is different.

Hi Randolph,

Thanks for checking this out. Since everything builds fine on other platforms -- and on Win with VS 2008 -- I'm not in a hurry to change the CMakeLists.txt file globally to include the quotes. I'll test the change on other platforms and compilers when I get a chance; if it doesn't break the others, I'll just change it. Otherwise we'll need yet another conditional to deal with Windows. 

- Rob

Hi Randolph,

I changed InstallRules\CMakeLists.txt to wrap the Qt lib calls in double quotes and sent to Greg, so that change will filter up to HEAD at some point. Also know that a more direct fix for this is to explicitly point to the qmake executable in cmake, with the QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE variable. I use this myself, because my Qt install is a little funky and is not exposed at the system level. Lemmeknow if you want more info on this.

I am pleased to be able to say that I have been able to get the simulation,
though not the timing part, of this benchmark running.  There is no "time"
command in the native Windows environment, and I don't yet know how to use
similar commands in the Windows Power Shell.  Looking hopeful, though of
course I have not yet seen the output.

Mark Stock, if you're reading, would you like my cross-platform changes to
the .rad files?  Windows, of course, does not have a "cat" command, which
means that "!cat" has to be replaced with "!xform".

Side note on the use of "!cat"  I often see things like this:

!cat input1.rad input2.rad | xform -ry 20

Which is completely silly.  Why not just use:

!xform -ry 20 input1.rad input2.rad

Even if you are going to a program that expects input on stdin, you can redirect it instead:

!fussy_program < input | second_program etc...

I've seen almost no one use cat for a reason in a Radiance file.  (No offense Mark, as I haven't even looked at yours!)

Cheers,
-Greg

I am pleased to be able to say that, in fact, I ran a successful simulation.
 My hasty hack compilations of libtiff 3.9.7 (the last version 3 libtiff)
and zlib 1.2.8 also worked, which was nice to see.

Performance, well, not so good.  It took 4219.9 wall clock seconds on a
fairly capable Xeon, which is 1.5-2x slower than I expect based on the
benchmark table.  I suspect some tweaking of compilation options would
considerably improve the performance, even with the relatively blah
Microsoft VC10 compiler.

Greg, Randolph,

I admit that my use of "cat" is simply habit---I saw it once (probably 
over 15 years ago) and never let go of it. I am actually not as savvy with 
Unix as I am on TV.

By all means make the benchmark as portable as you can and send me the 
changes. I will incorporate them as soon as I can.

I am silly. This vestigial code is still in OpenStudio, for "Radiance Classic" calcs with a continuous sky:

catCommand = "cat"
if /mswin/.match(RUBY_PLATFORM) or /mingw/.match(RUBY_PLATFORM)
 catCommand = "type"
end

system("#{catCommand} ./numeric/#{space_name}.map | rtrace #{rtrace_args} ?")

In this case, this really seemed to be the most direct way in. In any event, !type would be the true one-for-one replacement for !cat when porting Mark's scene to windoze.

Mark,

I've seen lots of people use it, probably because it fits what people expect to see in an inline command more than the stdin redirection.  I think there are even some examples in "Rendering with Radiance" using it, so you're in good company...

Cheers,
-Greg

I favor "xform" with no options for this job; if the system has Radiance, I
expect it will have "xform", regardless of what other commands are or are
not available.  But, YMMV.

boy, was that last remark off-target.  

I don't understand how that code can work?  Does something in that
implementation of "system" convert slashes to backslashes?

Anyhow, in this case, could one just perhaps divert rtrace's input?

  system("rtrace #{rtrace_args} < ./numeric/#{space_name}.map")

Or would that fail?

Redirecting the input works better on both Windows and Unix than cat, to my earlier point.

I have benchmarked Relux with the Radiance (or 'Raytracer', as they call 
it now) engine under Windows. This was done with Process Monitor, which 
is free download from the M$ site:
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-gb/sysinternals/bb896645.aspx

It's not quite the same as the UNIX 'time' command, but saves you 
sitting there with the old stop watch.

What you do is you launch PM and set up a filter for 'rpict', and/or 
anything else you wish to benchmark. Now run the benchmark. PM will 
capture the start and end time of this process. You can export the 
result to a text file. You still need to work out the runtime:
runtime = end - start.

It's not terribly elegant, but does work.

PM tends to be a little temperamental. I never got it to work on certain 
machines. It also might crash unexpectedly.

Cheers

Axel
