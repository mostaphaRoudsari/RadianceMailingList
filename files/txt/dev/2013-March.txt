Hi Folks, 

I installed the latest HEAD yesterday, and learned in a round about way how -spec has been replaced with -pal spec (or hot or pm3d...) 

When I errantly used -spec the error message indicated my mistake was in the -l or -log options. Reading the new man page showed me the way, but I suppose the preferred error message would have called my attention to the misuse of  -spec

(Also not sure if reporting these small bugs to the dev list is a best practice, so advanced apologies if this is misplaced...) 
Here are the commands I used and the error messages: 

$ falsecolor -ip images/6_1_1200.hdr -n 8 -s 8000 -spec -l cd/m2 -log 1 > test.hdr
bad option "cd/m2"

Hi Michael,

It appears that whenever you enter "-s*" you break the argument vector parsing. The scale option is expected as:
-s [some number]
or:
-s [a(uto)]

In other words, falsecolor is looking for a "-s", followed by a space, followed by either an integer (or the letter "a" to indicate autoscaling).

When you enter ?spec (or ?sun, or ?shit, or ?supercalifragilisticexpialidocious, for that matter),  you confuse the argument vector parser because it's expecting a space after the ?s. So instead of being caught by the "bad option" case, "-spec" causes an error, and whatever option follows "?spec" is presented as the culprit, but only because it's the next option in the argument vector. I agree, it's a misleading error.

In some more other words, I know what  the cause is, but not the cure. Axel (Andy? Greg?), can you help? We need some Perl and Regex assistance here.

Chaps,

Rob is correct about the -s trap of the argument parser in falsecolor.pl

This is fixable, and I'd be happy to do this. To my excuse, however, I 
must say that the arg parser in any of the csh scripts in Radiance, and 
probably in many of the Perl scripts, too, is not terribly 
sophisticated. It does its job, but not all possible errors are caught.

The arg parser in Radiance's Perl scripts is free-form, rather than 
relying on a module. This is both a deliberate design decision, but also 
born out of necessity: The Perl parsers are all based on GNU syntax, 
which Radiance doesn't follow. We looked into this, but it turned out 
that modifying existing 'bullet proof' modules to deal with all the 
quirks of Radiance command line args is simply a pain in the neck.

Existing Perl parsers are good with -s or --short-option style things. 
When you throw -a+ vs -a- at them, they just give up. Making this work 
properly is a helluva job.

So should -spec be treated as -pal spec (probably not), or should it 
throw up a more meaningful error message e.g. 'deprecated'?

Cheers

Axel

Agreed, I will say that Ruby has a nice class for this stuff, but in the
end it's probably not much more robust than whatever Perl's got going on.

I vote a deprecated error, along with a pointer to the newer -pal option &
syntax. 

Thanks Axel!

Agreed - a pointer to the newer -pal option would be great, it might help a few souls like myself discover the new colorscales. Best part of my week (well, my Radiance week) was stumbling upon the new heat map scale.

Michael,

could you give this a try and let me know if it works for you. I'm not 
saying 'read the man page', because I'm not sure how this is (or is 
going to be) done on Windows. All right?

I have taken the liberty to add a new '-pal eco' which I promised to 
submit almost a year ago.

There is also a new -cp (posterise) option that has been in HEAD for a 
while. Just needs mentioning on the man page.

@Greg,
please give us your opinion on the current implementation. I'm touching 
up the man page now. It needs the -cp option, and also the sponsor of 
the -pal eco option. Will report back....

Cheers

Axel

Hi Axel - Thanks! This works, and seems like a good error message. 

Hopefully I'm not the only -spec fan out there with out of date binaries, and others will benefit from this update.

I'm sure they will. When I talked Greg into this new -pal option (which 
is a lot more flexible), we weren't too worried about compatibility. 
You've just reminded us that old habits die hard. Now, if only there was 
a way of killing off this dreaded Desktop Radiance....

Oops, it is mentioned.

Cheers

Axel

As always, see source code for explanation.
