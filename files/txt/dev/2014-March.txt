No one that I know of. What is the issue? It's pretty fast, so I assume you're looking to eliminate a dependency.

It requires a Perl environment to run which isn?t as user friendly as a regular binary.

I?ve packed it into an executable using PAR::Packer but in my benchmark tests it?s about 20-30% slower than running the perl script since it has to decompress itself to a temporary location before it runs then clean itself up afterwards. When you?re running hourly sims for a full year (around 6000 sims discounting the hours without daylight) that 20-30% mounts up significantly (my benchmark went from 45 minutes down to 28 when switching to running the perl script instead of the packed binary).

This is on Windows using Strawberry Perl for all my Perl environment needs BTW.

If you are using the Perez Sky Model, I would suggest you to use GENDAYMTX
somehow. Maybe write a 1-hour "wea" file, and run that program. Makes sense?

OK yeah that's what I assumed. Good point about the load time, given the typical use case for gendaymtx (i.e. hourly calls). German's tip may be useful, since you can use epw2wea (a C program) to generate the hourly .wea files you'd need for that, but that's still a lot of annoying i/o. We do have some methods for dealing with OpenStudio's (many) dependencies ? including perl ? internally to OpenStudio, which may be of interest, Pally.
