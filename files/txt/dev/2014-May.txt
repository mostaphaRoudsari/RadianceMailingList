Does anyone know which repository is the de facto one for Radiance? I've been using the Git repository linked from the CMake dashboard at http://public.kitware.com/gitweb?p=radiance.git;a=summary however when looking for a bugfix for falsecolor.pl which Axel Jacobs submitted around the 16th of April, it only exists in the CVS repository at http://radiance-online.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/?pathrev=MAIN which I'd been led to believe was now deprecated in favour of the Git repository.

Personally I prefer the Git repository as it has the ability to download a snapshot with a single click. The CVS repository doesn't have this functionality enabled (apparently ViewVC can generate tarballs automatically but either it's not enabled for the Radiance repository or I can't find the link to get the file) & I'd prefer not to have to get a client application to do this if I don't have to.

Pally,

The CVS repo at radiance-online.org is the de facto, de jure, and just plain The One repository for Radiance. Everything else is mirrors. 

The Kitware repo started as a staging area for all the changes necessary to get Radiance reliably building on Windows, including the additions for the windows rvu. As such, a branch called "combined" was created, which held the master branch as well as all the changes we'd made. This was initially a testing branch, from which we made all the patches for Greg. Eventually we migrated the Git repository to NREL's public Github site, and for no particularly good reason, we left the combined branch. So the Github "combined" branch is actually a mirror of the radiance-online CVS "main", aka HEAD. 

Long story short, if you want to use Git for your Radiance source needs, you should be looking at the combined branch:
https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/tree/combined

*That* branch is synced hourly with the CVS, which is the "real" source:
http://radiance-online.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/ray/?pathrev=MAIN

The version of falsecolor on combined has that change...
https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/blob/combined/src/px/falsecolor.pl

Cheers Rob. Was a bit concerned that the kitware repository hadn?t been updated in over 2 months. I think I?ll have to use the public Github repository since it?s also got the handy ?Download Zip? button.

The ?Repository? link at http://open.cdash.org/index.php?project=radiance should probably be changed to point at one of the 2 up to date repositories (link is under the ?Project? menu).

Thanks for the heads up. By the way, we (NREL) now make release tags every time we release an updated set of installers now, so we can point to specific vintages of the HEAD. We place a file in the root Radiance dir called "NREL_ver.txt" with the tag number in the body, for reference.
