Dear List,

has someone experience with radiance and new MacOS 10.10? I tried it and got some unpleasant results: If you start rad with the -N option (for example: rad -N 4 -o x11 -v hem test.rif) it start as usual, but after a few seconds it seems to stuck, i. e. not responding to input, no further refining, no processor load. The processes seem to be waiting for something (forever):

 1447 s000  S+     0:00.00 rad -N 4 -o x11 -v hem test.rif
 1450 s000  S+     0:00.03 rvu -vth -vp 0 0 0.001 -vd 0 0 1 -vu 0 1 0 -vh 180 -vv 180 -vo 0 -va 0 -vs 0 -vl 0 -dp 512 -

 1453 s000  S+     0:00.24 rvu -vth -vp 0 0 0.001 -vd 0 0 1 -vu 0 1 0 -vh 180 -vv 180 -vo 0 -va 0 -vs 0 -vl 0 -dp 512 -

Similar things happen if you use it without -o x11 (rad -N 4 -v hem test.rif): some process start, parts of the image will be rendered. Than the load goes to zero and nothing happens any more. Here you can see some zombies:

There is nothing in the logs. I got the same results with the precompiled binaries and binaries compiled from the head revision under 10.10 with Xcode 6.1.

Any suggestions?

HI Andreas,

I am sorry to hear about this issue, and it is unlikely that there is any way to debug it.  A hung process doesn't respond to debugging, either!

The best approach is to kill one of the processes using "kill -QUIT" and seeing if it leaves behind a diagnostic file in $HOME/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/.  Then at least, we may find out what routine it is hanging in.

The only other idea I had is to disable "App Nap" system-wide to see if this is causing the problem.  See:

	http://www.defaults-write.com/10-9-disable-app-nap-in-os-x

I don't know why this would affect non-application processes, or why it would present an issue in 10.10 if it wasn't an issue in 10.9, but it's worth a try.

I will see if I can reproduce this on my copy of Yosemite as well.

Best,
-Greg

Hi Andreas,

A quick follow-up to this.  I tried it out on my copy of Yosemite, and confirmed the problem.  It seems to be an intermittent problem with the system select() call, which means there's little I can do about it except hope Apple recognizes the issue and posts a patch at some point.  The last change I made in this code related to a hanging condition was in 1997, and it's been working across Unix implementations since then.

For now, I can only suggest you avoid multiprocessing until the next patch release.  You can try reporting a bug to Apple, but without a simple test case to reproduce it, they are unlikely to do anything other than register the complaint.  I haven't seen anything on the net about it, yet.

Cheers,
-Greg

Hi Greg,

thank you for the quick response. I suspected that it is a bug from Apple and was hoping that the update today (10.10.1) would change something, but it does not. In general the Yosemite release seems to me buggier that the last couple of major updates, so it could be wise to avoid it for a while ...

Best,
Andreas

I just received the following from DropBox and it seemed like it *might* be
relevant:

We?re reaching out to let you know about an issue in Apple?s new OS X
Yosemite that causes problems withDropbox. You can resolve this issue by
installing the latest Software Update for OS X Yosemite.

OS X Yosemite may occasionally cause some programs to crash when you open,
save-as, or first save a file. These crashes are rare but happen when an
application, such asDropbox, uses Yosemite?s official Finder integration ?
and if that program crashes because of this interaction, unsaved changes
may be lost.

To fix this issue, Apple has released OS X Update 10.10.1. This update is
available for free in the Mac App Store. Details on how to update your Mac
are available onApple?s support site <http://support.apple.com/HT1338>.

Oops, I didn't see Andreas' last e-mail went to my junk folder. Sorry to
hear 10.10.1 doesn't help.
