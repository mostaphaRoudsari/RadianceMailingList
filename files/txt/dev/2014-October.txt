Message-ID: <478602475.16808.1412155284544.JavaMail.apache@nm51.abv.bg>

Hello, 
  I am a student in Vienna and working on a daylight simulation with pipeflow:  IDGB#optics6#window7.2#ecotect2011#grasshopper#radiance#daysim3.1  
  Asking with un unease, since you must also have a tight schedule,  still I need to post two question:  
    Could someone , please, make a break down of the steps creating double glazing material with coating for Radiance? 
After generating the *.rad files from optics do you manually correct the material in Radiance editor?
  How do I implement optics2glaze with the glaze script for achieving this?   
   here is one of the glazing systems:
  1st layer: pane 4mm
   		 PVB coating 0.78mm   		 6mm glass pane#cool lite skn 174  22mm Argon 90%  2nd pane : 4mmTn = 64%  (IGDB source)  
  Manufacturer value of the system
   					 Tn=68%   					 R(outside)=13%   					 R(inside)=11%  
  For my understanding tried to compare some values from manufacturer with my Window output - and the discrepancy is quite generous.  The PVB is missing, though.  
    How would you proceed when you solve this problem elegantly?    ATTACHED : the materials of the whole double insulated glazing system#output window7.2   			 
the single glass pane materials#output opitcs6  
  Any comments are highly appreciated.  
  Kind Regards from Vienna,  Niya

Hi Niya,

This probably belongs in the radiance-general list, not radiance-dev.  There is a Perl script called optics2rad that does this conversion.  Did you try that on your Optics export files?

Eventually, they will build a proper Radiance export into Optics, but it has been years and I am not holding my breath.

Best,
-Greg

Thank you Greg, will repost it there.  The time did come:Optics6 has already the option of exporting files to *.rad yet I was adviced to use the script for some reason.  Where can I find a user guide for Perl? Would be great to see what the output looks like and how to re-edit the material in Radiance.

Message-ID: <CAK+g53BFwounOi0YJoWuFfAvHQsZGE+TKXCDvMrm38xpL0_K+g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I have been thinking on how to accelerate calculations for building
simulation. Then, I noticed that many people do gray simulations (i.e.
R=G=B)... accordingly;

   - Would it make sense to perform a monochromatic simulation?
   - would this save time considering that the ray-casting process will be
   done ayway?

I know it will save time for the matrix multiplication process (i.e. DC,
3phase, 5phase methods), but there is no need to modify the ray-tracing in
order to save time in the matrix mult.

Also, changing the "Radiance ray-tracer" is something out of my scope,
really... but I might try if I know it is useful.

THANKS EVERYONE!

I really doubt it would save any significant time.  As you say, the same rays are being traced, and this is the main cost in Radiance. 

Cheers,

German,

some years ago we did something related to that - we used 81 instead of 3
channels to allow spectral renderings. Although having a factor of 27 in
the number of color channels, the computational overhead compared to the
RGB calculation was only around 40%. From that you can assume that going
from 3 to 1 channel would no really be worth it - as Greg already said.

Best,
David

Thanks Greg and David. I kind of already knew the answer to my questions, but was not sure (this algorithms keep confusing me)

Thanks Very much to both of you!

Thanks, Joe.  

This probably belongs on the "dev" mailing list, so will cross-post there and you can sign up and respond on that list if you don't mind.

None of these warnings generated the "There were some errors." conclusion at the end.  This was caused by a failed "clean" operation that didn't matter on the TIFF library:

cd tiff; make distclean
/bin/sh: line 0: cd: tiff: No such file or directory
make[1]: *** No rule to make target `distclean'.  Stop.
make: *** [clean] Error 2

Nevertheless, it was helpful to see some of these warnings, particularly the "implicit declaration" issues, which I needed to fix.  There was also a genuine bug in the ezxml code, which was likely never triggered as it had to do with an unused attribute types extension.  I fixed that one as well, even though it isn't really my code.

Cheers,
-Greg
