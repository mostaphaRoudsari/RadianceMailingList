Hi Andrei,

I don't know of any hard and fast limits to the size of a Radiance model,
but it looks like you've found one.

Since you're compiling the source code yourself, here's a suggestion to try
in objset.c. This should keep you from trying to access a negative entry in
ostable. Change lines 182-183:

int  osentry, ntries;
long  hval;

to:

unsigned int  osentry, ntries;
unsigned long  hval;

For good measure, you might also change line 197:

osentry = (hval + (long)ntries*ntries) % OSTSIZ;

to:

osentry = (hval + (unsigned long)ntries*ntries) % OSTSIZ;

I'd suggest moving this thread over to the radiance-dev list. I'm
interested to hear how your large models go.

Nathaniel

Agreed -- thread now moved to radiance-dev list.  (Andrei, you can sign up for this list if you aren't already at <www.radiance-online.org>.)

That's a good idea to use unsigned integersh, Nathaniel.  I've also suggested (in a private message to Andrei) that he try it with "long long" in place of "long," as I think the latter only uses 32 bits in VS on 64-bit Windows.

Let's see what happens with "long long" and in either case, I'll probably change to unsigned types where I can.

Cheers,
-Greg

Hi Greg & Nathaniel,

Thank you for the input and help. Both of you spotted the error amazingly quick!

I changed hval declaration from ?long hval? to ?long long hval? in objset.c, rebuilt oconv & rpict and both are working correctly for a large geometry (2.4 GB .rad file) ?

I think the problem is that hval goes beyond the long limit and becomes a huge negative number, causing osentry to become negative, which is an index to ostable array.. osentry should never be negative. So I agree that some of these variables should be changed to unsigned.

               osentry = (hval + (xtra_long)ntries*ntries) % OSTSIZ;
               os = ostable[osentry];

The reason oconv & rpict worked on Linux is that ?long? data type is assigned 8 bytes just like the ?long long? data type.. so no issues. However, on Windows a ?long? takes up 4 bytes and a ?long long? takes up 8 bytes, so there is the inconsistency.

Nathaniel, can you please recompile Accelerad rpict and oconv with updated objset.c, to account for this for this issue? I would like to test Accelerad with a large geometry scene.

Thank you so much,
Andrei Kolomenski

Great -- I've checked in the appropriate changes to objset.c in the HEAD distribution.
