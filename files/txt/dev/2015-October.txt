Cross-posting (and we should move the discussion to) dev...

Thanks Terrance! Looks like I have some more files to include in the CMake files, so our packages work correctly, thanks for the catches. As for item (1), it seems like the right move there is to have Greg change the shebang line to call "wish", and place the onus on the users to have a symlink for wish that points to whatever they have on their systems.

Let's sort it out on dev when we have time. Thanks again for the heads up.

Issues:
1. $ -bash: /usr/local/radiance/bin/trad: /usr/local/bin/wish8.0: bad interpreter: No such file or directory

    Fixed by sudo vi /usr/local/radiance/bin/trad and change the first line to "#!/usr/local/bin/wish8.5" as that is what is installed on my system.
2. Error in startup script: invalid command name "helplink"
    while executing
"helplink .mess trad trad messages"
    (file "/usr/local/radiance/bin/trad" line 104)
    Fixed by:
    a) downloading the source code (https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases)
    b) create folder  with " sudo mkdir /usr/local/radiance/lib/tcl"
    c) copy files from the source tree to the new folder
        cd /usr/local/radiance/lib/tcl
        sudo cp ~/Desktop/Radiance-5.0.a.6/src/util/*.tcl .
        sudo cp ~/Desktop/Radiance-5.0.a.6/src/util/*.hlp .
        sudo cp ~/Desktop/Radiance-5.0.a.6/src/util/*.icon .
        sudo cp ~/Desktop/Radiance-5.0.a.6/src/util/tcl* .
        This put the following file in the new folder:
            do_action.tcl       do_results.tcl    do_zone.tcl    gethelp.tcl    trad.hlp
            do_file.tcl            do_scene.tcl     file.hlp           help.hlp        trad.icon

    d) sudo vi /usr/local/radiance/bin/trad

Hi Terrance,

It's remarkable that you were able to sort this out without aid.

There's already a fairly sophisticated installation script written for trad, which gets triggered by "rmake install" in the src/util directory.  I wouldn't know how to replicate this using cmake, unless it can call the same script.

I updated this to work with wish8.5, but if it isn't run on your system, I guess it won't work.  You can call it outside rmake using:

	csh -f tradinstall.csh $(INSTDIR) $(LIBDIR)/tcl

where $(INSTDIR) is the Radiance executable directory and $(LIBDIR) is the Radiance library directory on your system.

Rob and I will figure out how to get this working on the NREL installers.  Thanks for alerting us to the problem!

Cheers,
-Greg

Thanks for shedding light on this, Greg. Since trad won't run on Windows, and the NREL Linux "packages" are nothing more than tarballs of the executables and library files, the only package that could benefit from this effort is the Mac one. Furthermore, since OpenStudio doesn't rely on trad for anything, this is pretty low on my TODO list, but it IS on the list. =/

Thanks Rob and Greg,

It helps to have previously compiled radiance on the system, so it was 
just a matter of checking folder contents. I thought after I had sent 
the email that I could have solved the wish reference with a link. Oh 
well both methods work, though the link is the better solution in the wild.

Nice to be able to offer some constructive comments instead of only 
questions.
