Hi All,

We?ve had a strange problem with objview which I?m not sure if it?s been discussed before (Radiance 5.1a in OSX 10.11.6).

When the rad model file name includes a command line option (e.g. ?this-Name.rad? includes ?-N?) then the script hangs as it cannot find its parameter.

Looking in objview, it seems the problem is in the lines like:

if (m/-g/)
elsif (m/-u/)
?

Replacing with:

if (m/\b-g\b/)

seems to have solved the problem.

Regards,
Santiago

Thanks, Santiago.  I hadn't noticed this problem before.  I checked in a version that should fix it, using a variant on your suggestion.

Cheers,

Thank you Greg. Credit is due to Nicola Rigoni, who found the problem.

Cheers,
