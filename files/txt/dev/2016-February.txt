Moving over to dev...

The Radiance source mirror on NREL's GitHub site is a dumb, one-way mirror. We use it to make the process of building and hosting Radiance installers, and that's about it. The CVS is still the home of Radiance, and that is where code changes are checked in, generally by Greg and sometimes by Roland now. On the rare occasions I actually do something to the Radiance code, I make my changes to combined and make a diff off that which I send to Greg and he merges into the CVS. Our Git bot updates the mirror hourly, at which time I revert to the last checkout and pull again, and off I go. I do make release tags on GitHib for the packages, but that's about it. Some people have used the Git issues to report, uh, issues, as well. But generally speaking the flow of code is one way, from CVS to Git.

As to why branch "master" is so out of date: master dates to the time when we started the mirror. From the outset the intent was to have a separate branch from which to develop the CMake system, and the Windows version of rvu. The developers responsible for the CMake work set it up this way, and when we moved the mirror crap to NREL we just left it as is. It all Just Works, provided you know about the whole 'combined' branch thing.

Now then, what are you trying to do, Randolph? What changes do you have that you wanted to merge? Again, you wouldn't merge them to NREL/GitHub, they'd need to go to Greg. You could also fork the NREL repo and do whatever you wanted, I suppose.

Seems if I follow "git clone https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/" with "git checkout combined" that does the job. How I would merge my local "combined" branch with the github respository (should I have changes and the permission to merge them) I don't understand, but then there's lots of things about git I don't understand.

(And I suppose we ought to move this discussion to the development list, bah!)

Why is "master" so far out of date?

To be clear Randolph, the "combined" branch is the one that's kept up to date with the CVS repository. Branch "master" is ancient. As the link Nathaniel posted shows, the combined branch has the evalglare source, and the CMake files include it in the build and package targets:

Subject: [Radiance-dev] strange pcomb behaviour: -x -y is different to -y -x
Message-ID: <CA+dqh625ZAKr7cfzYogxvWJ5Dr3OfdneiiP9-OaVNyYDnwRyxA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear devs,

I've noticed a strange behaviour of Radiance's pcomb command.  This is
with the latest HEAD from today.  Here is how to replicate this:

Create a test HDR

$ pcomb -x 400 -y 300 -e 'lo=(x/400)' > test.hdr

now extract pixel brightness, and re-assemble into a new HDR:

pvalue -d -b -h -H test.hdr |pvalue -r -d -b -h -x 400 -y 300 > test_out_xy.hdr

This produces a 300x400 (portrait) image, not 400x300 (landscape) as I
expected.  As a result, the scanlines are all wrapped:

http://www.jaloxa.eu/pickup/test_out_xy.hdr

BUT

If I reverse the -x and -y options, the result is as expected 400x300
(landscape):

pvalue -d -b -h -H test.hdr |pvalue -r -d -b -h -y 300 -x 400 > test_out_yx.hdr

http://www.jaloxa.eu/pickup/test_out_yx.hdr

is this a bug or a known quirkyness of pcomb?  AFAIK, the order of
command-line options is irrelevant with most (all?) other commands.

Have a very good weekend

Kind regards

Axel

Hi Axel,

If you read the pvalue man page very carefully, you'll note that the resolution option order matters for this command.  However, it doesn't matter for pcomb, which always produces "-y +x" ordering.  So, to reconstruct the image without the header information, you need to adhere to this ordering in pvalue.

Does this make sense?

_Greg

Hi Greg,

I did read the pcomb man page several times, but still managed to miss 
this bit:

"The ordering of the -y and +x options determines whether the scanlines 
are sorted along x or along y"

Apologies for this oversight.  I guess it escaped me because I have 
never come across an 'x y' ordered image.  Didn't even know this was 
possible, to be honest.

Many thanks for clarifying.  No bug, then, just me learning new things.

Have a good weekend.

Axel

Yes, it's a subtlety that rarely gets exposed in Radiance.  Only a few programs, like pvalue, protate, and pflip, do anything with the image orientation.  Some programs work only with the default (-y +x) orientation.  Others just pass along the orientation they are given.  Only a few programs produce non-standard image orientations, like ra_bmp when it converts a BMP file from stdin.

Cheers,
-Greg
