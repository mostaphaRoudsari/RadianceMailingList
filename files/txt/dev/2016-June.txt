Subject: [Radiance-dev] Modelling an LED Monitor with a Beam Pattern &
	Display Image
Message-ID: <AE55A995167B224DBBFA16500E3AB9B306D922F7@NDJSMBX202.ndc.nasa.gov>

Hello Radiance Experts,

I want to model an LED monitor with a measured beam pattern. Also, I want to superimpose an image on the monitor such that the light projected through the image is affected by the monitor's beam pattern.

I'm running into trouble with my current procedure (INCORRECT IMAGE COLORS -  TOP IMAGE), it produces a monitor image that appears to be color inverted, also the image surface has 0 radiance even though it is applied to a light primitive that has a radiance definition.

See top display image doesn't look like the bottom one, also the top image has no light output: https://s31.postimg.org/8cal8he6j/Monitor_Dif.png

Why is the top definition, using brightdata, produce a color distorted image, that has no luminance? Advice on modelling a monitor will be much appreciated!

Thank you for your time,
