Hi Rob,

it seems the windows version of evalglare in the github-installer is 
broken (v1.31, which is in the current headrelease) ... executing it 
with a file causes crashes. Alstan mentioned it to me and I could 
reproduce that problem in my windows-7 64-bit-VirtualMachine.

I have no idea why, maybe it is a 32/64bit issue (in one of the crash 
files I could see an entry "kernel32.dll", although I have a 64bit 
installation. But I'm not familiar at all with windows...

I also have a stand-alone version, compiled with mingw (32bit). I could 
provide that to you for an easy-fix in the installer, but this does not 
solve the problem. Let me know, what I could do to fix that.

I also tested quickly the linux-installer-binary version and this works 
properly, but it is actually 25% slower than the one I have compiled 
directly on my machine...

thx!

best

Jan

Well, that's a drag. Thanks for bring this to my attention though! I'll be
the first to admit my testing procedures are pretty weak with these
packages, so thanks to you and Alstan for pointing this out. I'll look
into it as soon as I can. There should be a new official release coming
up, so we'll add this to the list of things we wanted to tackle prior to
that release. Perhaps you and I can work together on the speed issue with
the linux version...

- Rob

there is no rush - people complaining I can redirect to my dropbox with 
the 32bit-mingw-version.

yes, we can work on that and do tests before the new version is released 
- then I will also change the version number of evalglare to 2.0.

best,
Jan
