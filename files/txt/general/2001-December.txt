About a year, maybe a year and 1/2 ago, I downloaded a

I was able to compile it (gcc 2.9x, Linux, Alpha), but I didn't get good
results. The latest stable one seams to be 3r1p20 (3.1.20).

Subject: [Radiance-general] trans material with sunless sky
Message-ID: <3C1554F3.CD444497@lbl.gov>

hi,

I hope this isn't a stupid question..
I have a room with transluscent skylights.
When I simulated the room with clear sunny sky, the illuminance values
inside the room were reasonable and expected, around 400 Lux.
When I simulated a cloudy sky or a intermediate sky without a sun, the
illuminance values inside the room were way too low, <30 Lux.
Why is this?  I usually use sunny sky and so never came across this
problem before.

Thus far I have changed the skylight material around several times to
make
sure that I didn't create a really bad example of a trans, I am running
mkillum
and surface normals are correct, and I have also increased the rendering

quality (to see if more light can be found) but nothing is working.

Any help for this would be great.
thanks,

judy

Hi Judy,

are those skylights the only windows in the room? Did the sun
actually hit the trans surfaces? In that case, what you're seeing
might be the expected result, even if you didn't expect it... ;)

The typical irradiance caused by direct solar impact is
approximately ten times that of the completely unobstructed
diffuse sky, under most conditions during the day. If you have
any area of the sky obstructed by other building parts from the
view of the skylights, that do not also obstruct the sun, then a
relation of 400 to 30 sounds perfectly reasonable. Or do you have
any more specific reasons to assume that the results for the
cloudy sky should be higher?

In the immediate transition from bright sunlight to an inside location
I can agree it initially looks way dark.

But pupils dilate.

Shouldn't there be a hack on the final brightness to simulate the stable
post-transition *apparent* brightness of the inside room?

I mean, am I alone in initially thinking a 60 watt reading light is dim
but inside 5 minutes, its way bright?

Sure, some radiance users want to know what a light meter tells them. But
other radiance people want to know what a person will SEE.

I have never been able to render final images better than the default
view. If I try to set it to what seems a sensible next quantum leap up
it dies the death of a gigabyte memory model on a megabyte machine.

Is there some wierd cube law here? Is it actually not possible to do
better than 512x512 images? 1024x1024 don't work for me.

(the sizes are notional. Its been a while)

Also, some of the *wonderful* textures such as the finer woodgrains
have very odd effects on time to compute. Is there a FAQ like known
set of textures to avoid for fast render?

Also Also wik: I did a kitchen with a mix of off-white and brushed steel
aluminimum surfaces. I found that the amount of colour picked up by
'gloss' surfaces was increadibly high, but if I didn't select off-whites
for detailed surfaces like tongue-and-groove wood, I got huge brightspots
which wiped out the image unless I wound back the lightbulbs to 5 watt
railway specials. I know that the chrome tap is reflecting part of a
perfectly rendered image of the lightbulb onto every shiny surface within
a 40 foot radius, but now I'm over 40 I can't see those little images
unless I stand real close. Does radiance have to render them? isn't
there some middle ground where it does high definition for some things
but not others?

(I am not a professional. I do not depend on this software. If you do,

What OS and hardware had you used ?  rpict  renders and writes the image
line-by-line, so memory consumption doesn't scale quadratically with image size

(only linearly with image width). Images > 12000x12000 pixels worked well
on machines with <256MB main memory.

What usually slows down rendering are (beside ambient bounces) cal files:
Their computing time is approx twice that of compiled code (if I remember that
number right- Greg ?). So the more elaborate the functions, the longer it
takes.

 pcond   applies a post processing step on the final image to model eye

Did you notice that you can change the "exposure" to which the
final image is displayed? It has a very similar effect to the
combination of shutter speed and iris opening in a photo camera.
The pcond program mentioned by Peter is just another step beyond
that, which also takes some physiological properties of the human
eye into account, that may depend on the absolute brighness levels.

It could also be that you made your surfaces too glossy. Most people
greatly overestimate the amount of gloss in their visual environment.
In reality, gloss levels for non-metallic surfaces are typically
way below 5% (rather around 1 - 2%).

It's called pixel resolution.
If you render a picture where the tap is three pixels wide and two
pixels high, then I'm pretty sure you won't recognize the bulb that
is theoretically reflected in its surface. If the tap fills half
of your image, then you probably *want* to recognize the reflected
bulb, and given the right distance, you certainly will. But even
when the final image doesn't show a recognizable mirror image of the
bulb, you still want to notice the sparcle of the reflection, so
there is really no other useful "middle ground" here.

Note btw., that the surrounding surfaces will *not* see a perfect
mirror image, unless you use the "mirror" material for the tap,
which you shouldn't. If you use just a shiny metal, then the diffuse
calculation from other nearby surfaces will hit the tap at most once
or twice, which isn't enough for an exact reflection. Only surfaces
that are very close will again see more, simply because the tap fills
a significant part of their surrounding space.

Btw: In real live, just because your eyes don't want to resolve
that mirror image anymore, doesn't mean that they don't receive
the information about it. If you want to simulate that effect with
Radiance, you can simply apply a soft blur to the final image... ;)

Yes, we do indeed! (at least for a reasonable definition of "pure")

Not for me. Dec Alphas, 586 and PIII class boxes with up to 512Mb and it
died. Could be compiler problems? I was using gcc.

I'm a naieve user. I construct 'furniture' as discrete boxes of surface in
a texture I like and then micro-adjust their position against room walls
until it looks 'right' -It may well be this introduces some overhead that
better constructed objects would avoid.

I still have real problems thinking in the project 3space inside the
model. I feel like a 5 year old trying to use a treasure island map on
the kitchen floor: 3 forward three left two up rotate twice six back...

labelled anchors to get base-relative locations could be nice. 

and I think I asked for a simple floating compass a while back, is there
a hack to get one into initial models to confirm various positions? or
a way to float key object points in text over the model?

cheers

I have tried that, but I think with stark white surfaces and too much
gloss, its very much like my Pentax MX: I can 'see' the surface fine
but when I dial down the exposure it is either too dark, or localized
good. Somehow ther is a median range of view eyes see, but I can't model
(my fault I suspect: I don't have the theoretical grounding or math)

Thats confusing. face on, short distance you can see very high quality
reflected images in tupak finished MDF for instance. Ok, 6 months later
the grease stains and dust make that more diffuse, but it 'seems' shiney
to me. Again, does the eye do a better job of ignoring that?

I suspect I just need a better mental table of recommended glossyness for stuff

Perhaps I did something wrong in my design. I found setting a minor colour
change on the metal of fixtures had a huge effect on the tones of the
surfaces that I presumed were reflecting it.

The relative amount of light reflected in a specular way is
independent of the "quality" of that specular reflection. Even if
it amounts for less than 1% of the total reflection, it may still
give you a clear mirror image, as the eye is capable of filtering
out a surprising amount of background noise as created by the
diffusely reflected light.

Remember that the human eye is a highly dynamic system, and not a
static camera. It doesn't snap still images, but scans the scene
by moving around, while usually also varying its own position to
a certain degree. If you're driving through the rain in your car,
then it's a good idea to keep your head moving a little from one
side to the other. This will cause you to see that road sign
shifting behind different raindrops on the windscreen, and helps
the image processing unit in your head to seperate the "real"
information from the visual noise caused by the wet glass. The
same thing happens if you try to discern a mirror image in an
imperfectly reflecting surface.

Global illumination in action!

You might want to compare your results to a photograph instead of
what you perceive when looking at the scene directly. The human
eye will adapt to the prevailing light color in the scene, and
filter out any global tints that it doesn't consider important.
You're visual apparatus performs a permanent and automatic white
balance correction, which doesn't happen when you make a picture
of the same scene.

Isn't it interesting how we only realize the extremely refined
inner workings of our perception when we try to simulate it by
computer?

Thanks.  No specific reason to assume it would be higher, I just
thought it would be because, having being inside during overcast
days, it doesn't always "feel" so dark.  But that's the eye doing the
adaptation thing...
I replaced the skylights with 99% clear glass and the maximum
reading inside room for overcast was 160 lux, this helped me
proved to myself that everything was ok.

Another question.  Pcond on a luminance image mimics what
the eyes sees.  Pcond on an illuminance image mimics ... ?

I don't think you really want to use pcond on an
illuminance image. If anything, then it might mimic
what the surfaces in your space would see if they
had the capabilities of the human eye, which sounds
quite unlikely...

Absolutely. A "real" looking rendered scene lives by a large quantity of tiny
visual information bits:
Non-perfect straight lines, _very_ slightly wobbled surfaces, hardly realized
textures, subtle shading .
Indicators, which, if missing,  indicate "rendered" to the brain.

can somebody tell me what is the purpose of illuminance images?  am i 
correct in saying that these are created by using the -i option in rpict/rview?

quoting from the Radiance Reference manual, 'This only affects the final 
result, substituting a Lambertian surface and multiplying the radiance by 
pi'.  so the numbers you end up with in these images are simply that, the 
reflected radiance multiplied by pi.  what does this represent?  it does 
not represent the irradiance falling on the surface.  for any 
non-Lambertian surface, it does not represent the irradiance reflected off 
the surface either.

so, for Lambertian reflectors, the results are reflected irradiances, which 
are the incident irradiances multiplied by the reflectance of the 
surface.  in a visualisation such as this, reflected irradiances are of 
very little interest.  radiance and incident irradiance are actually much 
more useful.

too often have i seen Radiance images presented overlaid with 
iso-illuminance contours.  according again to the Radiance Reference 
manual, under falsecolor, 'If the -i option of rpict was used to produce 
the image, then the appropriate label (for a falsecolor image) would be 
"Lux"'.  this means that the illuminance values displayed in these images 
are some manifestation of reflected illuminance.  from a photometric point 
of view, this is essentially meaningless.

if this is presented to a client to show them the illuminance distribution 
within their space, it really tells them very little.  iso-illuminance 
contours are meant to represent the illuminance falling onto an imaginary 
sensor at that location.  the -i option of rpict does not calculate 
this.  the only real way of presenting illuminance information is on a 
plane, real or imaginary, horizontal, vertical or tilted, not overlaid on a 
visualisation.

i understand that people have a better understanding of illuminance, and so 
to present things in this manner makes it easier for clients to 
understand.  but they should not be led to believe that these contours 
actually represent illuminances within their room which are to be compared 
with specifications, standards, etc.

can anybody correct me here?  i don't mean to ruffle any feathers, but i 
think Radiance is generally used by people with a good knowledge of light, 
and so it should be used accordingly.

Presumably what you would perceive if you were spread over all surfaces. 
Not unlike an LSD trip. Wouldn't try it if I were you. :^)

The purpose is to map the illuminance/irradiance of one or
several surfaces. So far, it's easy... ;)

Yes.

I think the description in the manual is a little obscure,
talking more about the implementation than its result. The effect
happens on the very first surface that a ray hits, unless it
has a transparent material, which delays this step by one bounce.
In the computation, the material of this surface is temporarily
replaced by a lambertian material of the reflectivity PI. This
means that the resulting value is indeed the irradiance resp.
illuminance at that point.

In practise, however, you shouldn't have to worry about this
mechanism, and I don't think it should be mentioned in the manual
at all. Just read the description of the -i parameter without the
technicalities, and its meaning will become crystal clear:

 -i  Boolean switch to compute irradiance rather than radiance
     values. Light sources still appear with their original
     radiance values, though the -dv option may be used to
     override this.

I had to check the sources myself to be sure (I just silently
assumed it worked like that until now), but the trickeries
involved really produce this simple and very useful result.

Not reflected illuminance. Simply illuminance at that point.
 From a photometric point of view, this is very reasonable, from
an imaging point of view, it is rather surrealistic. You have to
know that what you see is not something you'd be capable to see
without smoking heavy stuff.

If you substitute "real" with "conventional", then I agree with
the first part. Saying that overlaying this information on a
visualization is "unreal"... well yes, maybe I agree with this too.
Fortunately, that doesn't make it less useful to those who
understand what it means!

Subject: [Radiance-general] Modeling Lamps
Message-ID: <3C1FE6D3.746C9271@archenergy.com>

Hello,

I am modeling several fluorescent troffers and am a little confused with
the "Glow" primitive commonly used to model lamps.  I have figured out
that it does not pass an illum surface and cause any additional
illumination.  It does, however, change the luminance of the luminaire
when viewed directly (i think only when using the "illum" primitive for
the ies data and not the "light" primitive).  So, I would like to get
this "Glow" correct so that I can compare the luminance ratios of
various fixtures.  In Desktop Radiance's fixture library it seems to
typically use 53.195959 as the RGB radiance value.  I can't figure out
where this number came from.  First of all, what units are these
Radiance values in?  W/ster/m2?  If this is the true than I calculate
for say a T8;

32 W / 4*pi steradians / 2*pi*0.5 sf = 0.8105 W/ster/sf

0.8105 W/ster/sf * (m2/ 10.764sf) = 0.0753 W/ster/m2

This doesn't seem right.  Please correct me if there is any error in my
calculation.

If the radiance vaue is supposed to be photometric and in units of
lumens/ster/m2 than I calculate;

2900  lumens / 4*pi steradians / 2*pi*0.5 sf = 73.46 lumens/ster/sf

73.46 lumens/ster/sf * (m2/ 10.764sf) = 6.824 lumens/ster/m2

Then the Rendering with Radiance book on Page 322 and 323 gives examples
of using the "lampcolor" program and for a daylight fluorescent (? not
sure what this is) with 2900 lumen output it gives RGB values of
0.867251 1.189160 1.066163.

I am confused.  And seeing as how this "Glow" primitive completely
effects the luminance of my parabolic troffers I do not want to continue
my comparison without assurance that I am modeling them correctly.  Any
clarification would be helpful.  Thanks!

Regards,
Zack Rogers

Georg,

You have eased my mind a whole heap.  After giving it a try for myself, i 
am now agreeing with you that the -i option of rpict does produce incident 
irradiance values.  I haven't yet tried this out on a visualisation 
including specular highlights, but have no reason to believe that the 
specular highlights will appear and make the results meaningless.

Seems that, without looking into the source code, i was mislead by the 
(all-too-brief) explanation in the Radiance manual.

Thanks again,
Phil G.

Message-ID: <Pine.SOL.4.33.0112191122160.12241-100000@qix.gpcc.itd.umich.edu>

Hello. I am trying to calculate luminance values from Radiance RGBE
values. Somehow, I am not getting good results.

For example, at a certain pixel, the RGBE values are:
R = 128;  G = 137;  B = 165; E = 129
which is (1.00 1.07 1.29) in RGB values.

The luminance value computation is given by the formula:
luminance = 179 * (0.265*R + 0.670*G + 0.065*B)

With the above RGB values, I calculate luminance as 190.77 (which is
too low) and luminance inquiry in ximage gives 3181 cd/m2 (which makes
lots of sense) for the same pixel. Obviously, I am missing something here.

I would appreciate any help in calculating luminance values from RGBE
data. Thank you.

In your example picture, you'll find the following line in the
file headers (or something very close):

  EXPOSURE=5.9971707e-02

This means that the pixel values in the file are stored relative
to this exposure value, and you need to divide your result by
it to get at the actual luminance:

  luminance = 179 * (0.265*R + 0.670*G + 0.065*B) / e

Reality is often much less complicated than expected. ;)


You give a luminous flux of 2900 lm for your type of 32W T8 (this
can vary with color/quality). Given the standard efficacy used by
Radiance, this amounts to 16.2 W of light energy (which can't be
directly determined from the electrical consumption!)

The tube has a circumference of approximately 81.7 mm and a
luminous length of around 1.198 m. This results in a luminous
surface of 0.0979 m2.

The radiance of this tube is therefore:

  16.2W / (0.0979m2 * Pi) = 52.7 W/m2/sr

This is what the average rgb value of your glow material should
be based on. The luminance of the tube then amounts to 7684 cd/m2.

Btw: If I feed the lampcolor program with those values, then I
get very different results than you do:

$> lampcolor
Program to compute lamp radiance.  Enter '?' for help.
Enter lamp type [WHITE]: daylight fluorescent
Enter length unit [meter]:
Enter lamp geometry [polygon]: cylinder
Cylinder length [1]: 1.198
Cylinder radius [0.1]: 0.013
Enter total lamp lumens [0]: 2900
Lamp color (RGB) = 35.450659 48.609340 43.581585

0.265*35.450659 + 0.670*48.609340 + 0.065*43.581585 = 44.8

This is 0.85 of the 52.7 above. Lampcolor has a depreciacion
factor for each lamp type, possibly accounting for aging (the
actual purpose of the factor is not documented).

Hi Everybody,

I've just returned from a trip to Europe, so I'm up in the middle of the 
night reading e-mails since my  brain thinks it's noontime....

I must say that I'm really impressed with the quality (and quantity) of 
discussions going on in this list, and I haven't seen a single wrong or 
misinterpreted factoid coming from any of the discussants.   Schorsch is 
particularly on the ball -- someone should pay this guy!  The discussion 
of the -i option for irradiance calculation was particularly 
interesting.  This really is just a way to turn all the surfaces into 
illuminance sensors, oriented according to their normals.  This didn't 
make sense to me for windows or light sources, so I left them out of the 
hack.  I find the information useful, but it does require better 
explanation than I left in the manual.  Sorry about that -- 
documentation was never my speciality.

I just wanted to respond to the following message:

I apologize for being remiss in my maintenance of the Unix version of 
Radiance.  I've actually been working on it all along, but unable to 
distribute it due to license ownership by LBNL.  Fortunately, that seems 
to finally be changing, and they've hired me for a little consulting to 
put Radiance back on the Unix map.

At SGI, I spent a fair bit of time developing the holodeck addition to 
Radiance, which is sort of like rview on steroids -- allowing users to 
move freely about a space while an interactive rendering goes on.  This 
enhancement is explained in the following paper, available from my 
website:

Ward, Gregory and Maryann Simmons, `` The Holodeck Ray Cache: An 
Interactive Rendering System for Global Illumination in Nondiffuse 
Environments,'' ACM Transactions on Graphics, 18(4):361-98, October 1999.

	http://viz.cs.berkeley.edu/~gwlarson/papers.html

Nevermind that, though, the real news is that I would like to offer beta 
testers a new Radiance distribution for Unix, which I need som help in 
making sure it compiles OK on various machines.  It may be found at:

	http://viz.cs.berkeley.edu/~gwlarson/pickup/Radiance3R4b.tar.gz

This release is being called 3.4 to avoid conflict with previous (LBNL) 
releases, but it will become the official Unix release once it's been 
tested and verified.  I have compiled and tested it myself on Mac OS X, 
and you can take a shortcut to the binaries by picking up the following 
file as well:

	http://viz.cs.berkeley.edu/~gwlarson/pickup/radbin_osx.tar.gz

Unfortunately, I have not had time to get rview working under Aqua at 
this point, and you are stuck with using the pdisp script (included) to 
run ra_tiff or normtiff followed by the Mac Preview program to display 
images under Aqua.  I am working on a high dynamic-range image browser 
that will facilitate looking at Radiance (as well as other) image 
formats, but an alpha version of this software is still months away, 
since it's an after-hours project.

If you're interested in checking out the new holodeck program, you can 
drop into the ray/obj/cabin directory and try running the following 
commands:

% make nightcabin.oct
% rholo -o x11 -n 1 night.hdk night.hif &

This starts up rholo with the X11 driver and one rtrace process.  Read 
the rholo manual page for information on how to use the mouse to 
navigate once the calculation is running.  If you're on a Sun or SGI 
workstation, you should even be able to run the -o ogl driver, which 
looks and works much nicer, especially if you run the following 
beforehand:

% make living.oct bed.oct bath.oct

To restart rholo in a subsequent run, leave of the .hif file, since it 
will reuse the values stored in the holodeck.  I really should write a 
primer on using this program, because it's operation is a bit 
complicated and obtuse, but Radiance users are used to that....

Please give me feedback on compile problems you run across, and share 
the output of your "makeall install" if you get stuck.  I know there are 
a couple of hitches on Mac OS X and Solaris having to do with missing 
headers or broken things in the TIFF library, and I'm a bit baffled as 
to how to fix those.  You may have to compile or install a few files 
manually there until I get those issues resolved, but I am aware of them.

Thanks in advance for your help!
-Greg

P.S.  Raphael Compagnon and I are hoping to hold an advanced Radiance 
workshop next Fall, and I'd be interested to hear from interested 
parties.

Reality is often much less complicated than expected. ;)


Ah, but modeling and simulating reality is a different matter.  :-)


You give a luminous flux of 2900 lm for your type of 32W T8 (this
can vary with color/quality). Given the standard efficacy used by
Radiance, this amounts to 16.2 W of light energy (which can't be
directly determined from the electrical consumption!)

The tube has a circumference of approximately 81.7 mm and a
luminous length of around 1.198 m. This results in a luminous
surface of 0.0979 m2.

The radiance of this tube is therefore:

16.2W / (0.0979m2 * Pi) = 52.7 W/m2/sr

This is what the average rgb value of your glow material should
be based on. The luminance of the tube then amounts to 7684 cd/m2.

Btw: If I feed the lampcolor program with those values, then I
get very different results than you do:

$> lampcolor
Program to compute lamp radiance. Enter '?' for help.
Enter lamp type [WHITE]: daylight fluorescent
Enter length unit [meter]:
Enter lamp geometry [polygon]: cylinder
Cylinder length [1]: 1.198
Cylinder radius [0.1]: 0.013
Enter total lamp lumens [0]: 2900
Lamp color (RGB) = 35.450659 48.609340 43.581585

0.265*35.450659 + 0.670*48.609340 + 0.065*43.581585 = 44.8

This is 0.85 of the 52.7 above. Lampcolor has a depreciacion
factor for each lamp type, possibly accounting for aging (the
actual purpose of the factor is not documented).

Thank you, Georg, for the excellent summary of the steps in modeling a lamp.  My only suggestion would be to consider modeling the lamp as "WHITE" if there is only going to be one type (color temperature) lamp in the scene.  This will avoid hassles with color balancing the image with pfilt.

The depreciation factor associated with each lamp type is defined in the lamp.tab file.  The depreciation factor is intended to account for the difference between the rated "initial lumens" of the lamp and the effective "mean lumens" that one would expect to get over the rated life of the lamp.  This is according to a discussion with Greg many years ago.

Georg,

Thanks for the help, I'm still a little confused though.

First, the efficacy radiance uses for a 32W T8 is 179lumens/W?  I'm assuming
that efficacy is for light energy and not power consumed.  Is this the same
for all lamps?  Most of the time the efficacy of a lamp refers to the power
consumed, a typical T8 having an efficacy of 2900lumens/32W or 90lumens/W.

Also, I agree that the luminous surface is 0.0979m2 (I had missed a length of
4' in my calc).  Then you calculated the radiance with

  16.2W / (0.0979m2 * Pi) = 52.7 W/m2/sr

This is the total radiant output per steradian per area.  However, it seems
like the total steradians you should be dividing by is the entire sphere that
the 16.2W of radiant energy is filling, a sphere being 4*pi steradians.  This
gives;

 16.2W / (0.0979m2 * 4 * Pi) = 13.17 W/m2/sr

So, I'm still a little confused with the math here, and the efficacy used to
convert lumens to light energy(W).

BTW, I too get those values when I run lampcolor, I was just looking at the
example in the Rendering with Radiance book, which I guess might have a typo.

Thanks for the help,
Zack

I'm not sure if efficacy is really the best word here. The value
of 179 is simply the factor that Radiance normally uses for
converting between photometric and radiometric units (lumens per
Watt of radiation in the visible spectrum), taking into account the
response curve of the human eye for a "uniform white" light color.

Since Radiance knows nothing about electricity, the electrical
power consumption of your lamp has no relevance in the
calculation at all. For all we know, you could just as well be
working with a magic oil lamp!

Why do we divide by Pi? Good question...
I don't have a degree in math myself, so I can't explain this
very well either. The best hint might be that we're looking at a
discrete direction (a point out of a continuum), and not at a
fraction of the total [hemi]sphere (a subset of that continuum).
Our direction has a solid angle of zero, while your line of
thought assumes a solid angle of 1.

That doesn't really explain the division by Pi, but at least it
shows why a division by 4*Pi for the full sphere (or 2*Pi for the
hemisphere) would be wrong. The factor of Pi can probably be
found somewhere in the derivation of the integral that stands
between radiance and radiant exitance, but I'll leave that as an
excercise for the readers... ;)


> So, I'm still a little confused with the math here,

Don't worry, so is everybody else!

Howdy Zack!

The total output of a source is found by integrating its radiance L over
the directions of emission and over its entire surface area A. This
effectively gives you an outer integral over the area and an inner
integral over the directions per surface element. The latter is weighted
by the cosine of the angle to the surface normal and the differential
solid angle. Lacking ascii art skills I'll refrain from cramming the
formula in here.

In the very simplistic situation where the emission is invariant with
respect to direction and position on the luminaire (i.e. diffuse), this
integral simply becomes:

Power = L * pi * A,

The RGB radiance values in the example above are derived from these
rules (lampcolor assumes a diffuse emitted), and they also include a
depreciation factor for the luminaire.

Thank you for releasing a new version of Radiance.  I will try compiling
it on my alpha this weekend and post my results :-)

Regarding a Radiance workshop, I am somewhat interested.  Approximately
where and when would such a workshop be held?  I am guessing the
workshop would be held in the Berkeley or SF area, but could you be more
specific about the time: september, october, november?  Also, how
accessible would this workshop be for newbies?  Raytracing is my hobby,
so I am more interested in just creating images than architectural
lighting (I am currently working my way through your book RENDERING WITH
RADIANCE).

Once again, thanks for updating Radiance.

This is really just at the idea stage, but what we were thinking about 
is an October 2002 workshop in Fribourg, Switzerland (an hour and a half 
from Geneva or about 2 hours from Zurich if I remember right).  Raphael 
Compagnon has held three introductory Radiance tutorials over the past 
several years, and a few participants have asked for something more 
detailed as a follow-on.  His intro materials have been available in the 
reference directory on the Radiance website for a while, but he may have 
a more recent update for us (Raphael?)  We haven't figured out whether 
to set it up as a tutorial or a workshop or a bit of both, where people 
could present the work they are doing as well as learn some more 
advanced techniques.  We're just asking for input at this point, and 
looking for interested parties.  We'd probably want to recover 
sufficient costs for me to fly out there and perhaps one or two other 
Radiance experts, but I haven't investigated all the costs at this point 
and we need a better idea of how many participants, etc.  Once I get 
some feedback, we'll start to flesh out some kind of agenda.

Whoa.  I was assuming the west coast of the US, but then I 
shouldn't assume.  Count me in as "marginally interested", which 
means "extremely interested but highly doubtful that I can afford it".  
Sounds interesting though!

Even more interesting when you should happen to be interested
in medieval urbanism:

Hmmm... That's about 6 hrs driving from here.

i'm really keen to join in too, but have the same problem with funding to 
get there.  there will be a meeting of advanced daylighting simulators in 
Ottawa in October (7-11).  perhaps if the timing was right we could make it 
to Switzerland in the same trip.
