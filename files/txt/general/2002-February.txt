Hi Zack,

There are some impressive visualisations displayed on your web-site.  I am 
particularly interested in your panoramic animation of the pool.  could you 
tell us how you created this animation?

Thanks,
Phil Greenup.

Hi all,

Has anybody out there ever used the he.cal or he3.cal files with the 
brtdfunc primitive?  i have been attempting to use it a bit, and found some 
troubles.  every time i use either of them on my pc based adeline version 
of Radiance, the simulation crashes.  has anybody else had similar 
problems, or had any success?

Thanks again,
Phil Greenup.

Phil,

Thanks for the kind words!  The panoramic animations are really quite easy with
Radiance.  I create a view that is cylindrical, has a horizontal view angle of
360 degrees and a vertical view angle of 90.   So for example center.vf reads:

rview -vtc -vp 875 855 141 -vd -1 0 0 -vu 0 0 1 -vh 360 -vv 90

This creates the full 360 deg view of the space....Radiance is simply amazing!
I've tried having a vertical view angle of 180, which in theory could give you
a complete sphere of view angles allowing you to pan down and up as well, but
that does not seem to work and I'm not exactly sure why.  You get a very
vertically elongated image.

Then I convert the Radiance images to .jpg format....and I go through the gif
format to do this.

Then there are two programs you can use to view these 360deg images as
panaramic animations.

1)  Pixaround.com provides a free panoramic viewer called PixScreen.  You just
open any jpg image in the program.  Viewing in full 360o mode adjusts the image
to give the correct perspectives, otherwise you get these curvy lines that are
not realistic.  PixAround also has a program that I believe is $150US called
PixMaker that then lets you publish these panoramics to a website or create
stand alone executables....they call them "postcards".  The stand alone
executables are nice because no programs or plugins are needed to view them.

2)  The other option, and I prefer this format because allows some movement up
and down and creates panoramics in the somewhat common quicktime *.mov format,
is PanoWorx.  PanoWorx I believe is $200US.  This is the format posted on our
website.  This program will take any gif or jpg and convert it to .mov format
which can then be viewed with Quicktime.

Both programs can also take any number of images and seam them together to
create panoramics....at some point I would like to add actual photograph
landscape backgrounds to these images.  The animation of the new Fraunhofer ISE
Building ( http://www.ise.fhg.de/radiance/ ) has a city backdrop that is really
cool looking.  I would be interested to learn how this was done?

I hope this helps!  I'm really excited about these panoramics and the
architects I work with have really liked them.  It really helps them visualize
what the space will feel like.

Zack

Hello,

I just tried to install the new Unix version of radiance.
I downloaded the sources from LBL but it seems that
the rad3R4.tar.gz archive is corrupted.
I used GNU tar on Linux and cygwin to unpack it.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Perspective Projection: Camera  Matrix
Message-ID: <3C5A9F34.4020407@iup.uni-heidelberg.de>


Hello everyone,

I am currently using Radiance to generate some test images
for computer vision algorithms.
It would be quite helpful to have a program that calculates
the  3x4 projection matrix (let's call it P) from Euclidian 3-space
to image pixel coordinates for a given set of Radiance view parameters.

That is,  for a given Point (X,Y,Z) in the Radiance scene
file I want to find P (depends on the view-parameters) so that
the pixel coordinates x,y of the point in the rendered image are given
by

                     X
          u          Y
          v  = P *   Z
          w          1


     x=u/w
     y=v/w.


It should not be very difficult to do this. But nevertheless
I'd  like to know whether somebody already did this before
I waste time on re-doing it.


Thanks,

Volker

This is due to the fact that you have a completely normal
perspective in vertical direction. A vertical opening angle of
180 degrees would result in an infinitesimally tall picture.
The first diagram (below the Rayfront screenshot) on this
page illustrates the principle:

I used he.cal a couple years ago with the sparc compilation of Radiance
(binaries downloaded from the Radiance Web site).  It was extremely slow,
but didn't cause any other problems.

Use the vwright program, which outputs the view computation vectors in 
the second form.

Here is a link to the man page:

	http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/man_html/vwright.1.html

It does this with some library calls, so if you need to access this 
information from a C or C++ program, you might be able to figure it out 
from the source code in ray/src/util/vwright.c

I remember when I added the -vtc option to Radiance, there was a free 
utility for making QTVR panoramas from cylindrical PICT images.  I did a 
quick search and found the following webpage:

	http://developer.apple.com/quicktime/quicktimeintro/tools/

On there is a link to "QTVR Make Panorama 2", which does exactly this.  
I haven't tried it, but I recall it used to be necessary to first rotate 
the image, using protate to go to ra_pict, then to this tool.  
Unfortunately, they only have a Mac OS version, but with a little more 
searching, you might find a Windows edition somewhere....

somehow I was unlucky the other day. I downloaded the archive
several times (using IE,Mozilla,Netscape) but every time
it seems that the download stopped a few kB short of the
whole archive without generating an error message.
Today I used wget to download and got the whole archive.

Thanks,

Subject: [Radiance-general] Color appearance and color temperature
Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.0.20020206165429.00bee1b8@vttmail.vtt.fi>

Hello,

Does anybody know tools that might help in tuning chromaticity (color 
temperature) adaptation for Radiance renderings? For example, if you define 
a tungsten source (2856 K), the result is far too reddish to be plausible. 
This question arises when mixing sources of different temperatures, such as 
daylight and incandescent light. (When this is not the case, I suppose it 
is reasonable to use neutral source color, which in the Radiance RGB system 
is near 5500 K).

In pcond you have an opportunity to define, besides the RGB primaries, also 
the white point, with the -d option. Does it include any "color appearance 
model" or something of a kind which could be useful? Any other ideas? In 
photography there are filters defined in "mired" units, which mean 
reciprocals of megakelvins. They shift the overall color temperature range. 
So, at least in the spectral domain a feasible transformation might be 
quite straightforward.

Regards,
Markku N.

One of the new features in Radiance 3.4 is a von Kries white-point 
transform built into the -p option of pcond (and other programs).  This 
transform does a reasonable job of simulating the apparent colors under 
a different illuminant, and is an improvement over the straight color 
transform that was used previously.  However, when you have a mixture of 
illuminants in your rendered scene, there is no accepted adaptation 
transform for such a condition.  A number of researchers have worked on 
this problem, and no one has proposed a workable solution to my 
knowledge.  The best you can do is pick an average of the illuminants 
that seems right for the part of the scene you are viewing.

The issue of white balance is separate from the issue of spectral 
rendering, but as long as we're on the topic, one of the things people 
have requested over the years is a means for full spectral rendering in 
Radiance.  As it turns out, this is difficult for the very silly reason 
that all the materials and patterns have arguments whose count would 
change with the number of spectral samples.  Choosing anything other 
than three samples will make Radiance input files incompatible with the 
change.  In hindsight, it would have been much better to do things the 
way I did them in the Material and Geometry Format (MGF), which 
separates color into its own entity, with a number of different ways to 
specify it.

Be that as it may, it is possible to obtain accurate spectral renderings 
of a scene with a single illuminant, provided you precompute the 
adjusted RGB color of the surfaces using a technique I described in my 
most recent paper at the Color Imaging Conference.  You can get a PDF 
copy of the paper through the link below if you want to read about the 
details.

Thank you, this was very helpful.
But it apparently means that only the latest Unix releases will have the 
new feature?

The von Kries transform seems to be a linear matrix transform. Is there any 
way to perform such arbitrary (user defined 3x3 matrix) transforms on 
Radiance images? If not, would it be possible to have such a thing some 
day?... It could be suitable for various tasks and experiments with images.

The pcomb program provides for arbitrary color transforms, among other 
things.  It's not the most efficient way to apply a 3x3 color matrix to 
an image, but it works.  You just have to write out the equations for 
it, for example:

pcomb -f myclrmat.cal -e 'ro=Mrr*ri(1)+Mrg*gi(1)+Mrb*bi(1)' \
		-e 'go=Mgr*ri(1)+Mgg*gi(1)+Mgb*bi(1)' \
		-e 'bo=Mbr*ri(1)+Mbg*gi(1)+Mbb*bi(1)' inp.pic > out.pic

The file myclrmat.cal contains the above coefficients, something like:

{ Color transformation coefficients }
Mrr : 1.25; Mrg : .21; Mrb : -.07;
Mgr: .10; Mgg : 1.13; Mgb : .10;
Mbr: -.11; Mbg : .03; Mbb : .97;

These values are totally made up -- use whatever you like.  The ':' 
makes the calculation slightly more efficient since it declares the 
values are constant, and is preferred unless you want the coefficients 
to vary somehow over the image.  It's probably better to put the 
formulas I have on the pcomb command line directly into the myclrmat.cal 
file.  I just wrote it this way for illustration purposes.

There are of course a million things you can do with pcomb, at least.  
Color transforms are among the more mundane applications of a 
programmable image filter, but the are useful.  If you have many such 
transforms to do, you might want to write a special-purpose program that 
would be faster at it.

Thank you, this was very useful.

May I ask some related questions (sorry, they may be trivial but I did not 
find answers from the documentation):

Since Radiance has its own RGB definition, I tried to find out what is the 
RGB gamut produced by ra_tiff. Is it sRGB of something else? (pcond seems 
to produce sRGB as a default - am I right?). I am using the DOS/Windows 
executables. Is the resulting RGB gamut same for all systems?

Message-ID: <Pine.BSF.4.30.0202141429250.44427-100000@emancholl.pair.com>

Hi all,

one of my customers has just tripped over a bug that is present
in all Radiance versions I have looked at so far, but only has
any consequences on Windows. I haven't had the time to look at
3.4 yet, but it's quite likely to around there too.

The function replace() in replmarks.c allocates a string buffer
on the stack, but doesn't worry about its contents any further
at this point. The assumption seems to be that the function
buildxf() will do so, which it does most of the time. The problem
is, that for octree instances that are not scaled, and are exactly
aligned with the parent coordinate system, this is not the case.
In this situation, strlen() is applied to the *unaltered* string,
and the remaining transformation arguments are written *after*
anything that is already present there.

As a result, the output data will almost always contain
arbitrary and usually binary characters. On unix, this doesn't
seem to be a problem very often, as the parser appears to simply
ignore binary data in scene files. The Windows version correctly
reports 'bad arguments for instance "xxxx"'.

Fortunately, the fix is simple. At the beginning of the replace()
function in replmarks.c, include the following line:

	buf[0] = '\0'; /* make sure we don't include any garbage */

This garantees that the string in the buffer has a length of
zero to begin with, and avoids all further confusion.


Have fun!

Unfortunately, the RGB coordinates I chose for Radiance predated 
(slightly) those chosen for sRGB, and they don't quite agree.  In fact, 
the red and blue primaries are the same, only the green primary differs 
slightly.  The gamut of the Radiance color space is therefore slightly 
larger than sRGB, but not significantly larger.  It would be much better 
of course if they were the same, but it was a couple of years before I 
noticed the difference as sRGB came into vogue, and I didn't want to 
make a change that would affect the colors of all my rendered images, 
however slightly.  If you like, you may redefine the primaries in the 
main src/common/color.h to match the sRGB primaries, like so:

*** color.h     Wed Oct 21 17:48:07 1998

-------------------
You'll notice above that I also use "equal energy white" for the 
Radiance white point, i.e., neutral.  I chose this rather than the sRGB 
standard of D65 because it avoids the need to specify non-white sources 
to achieve color-balanced pictures.  This is less of a problem with 
3.4's incorporation of the von Kries transform, so using D65 in Radiance 
should work OK now so long as you render things with this in mind.  
Thinking about it now, I'm still a little muddy on what the exact 
procedure should be; I've gone so long skirting these issues in my 
work....

Sorry Markku -- I didn't really finish answering your question....

The RGB color space used by all version of Radiance for the last 5 years 
at least should be the same, namely those given in src/common/color.h.  
The latest 3.4 release handles the transformation into other spaces 
differently, so using the -p option of pcond, ra_tiff, or ra_xyze will 
give you a different result, and this different will be significant for 
large white point changes.  (If you stick with an equal-energy white, as 
you are encouraged to do by the outdated documentation, there will be no 
change in your results.)

The ra_tiff program does not normally report the Radiance primaries to 
the appropriate chromaticity tags in the TIFF output.  It only does this 
if you use the ra_tiff -p option or a PRIMARIES= line appears in the 
Radiance header. The latter only happens when one of the other programs 
(pcond or ra_xyze) puts it there when it gets a -p option.  All very 
confusing, but I'm sure I must have had a good reason for doing it this 
way.  I just can't recall what it was.

-Greg

P.S. to Mischler -- good find on the replmarks bug.  Sure enough, it's 
in 3.4 as well.  I've put in a fix for the next release.

as with all mailing lists, admin request should not be sent to the list
itself.

Stated in the welcome message sent at your subscription (and repeated
monthly), one good way to manage one's subscription is to sent email to
the robot managing the list:

     radiance-general-request@radiance-online.org

commands  given in the message body include: "help" for overview and
"unsubsribe".  "help" says:

    unsubscribe <password> [address]
        Unsubscribe from the mailing list.  Your password must match
        the one you gave when you subscribed.  If you are trying to
        unsubscribe from a different address than the one you
        subscribed from, you may specify it in the 'address' field.

With the mailman program we use at radiance-online, you find it easiest
to  manage your subscription via the web (www.radiance-online.org, click
on "general" mailing list). You are free to change any details of your
subsciption, including removal.

In case you forgot your password, you can have it emailed to you. See
the webpage for details. (Last text entry on "Radiance-general
Subscribers" section). It's all designed so that users have a direct and
easy way to manage their account without having to wait for humans.

If all fails, sent email to

     radiance-general-admin@radiance-online.org

which forwards your mail to the admin in charge (currently me). Admins
are happy to reply, but it may take some  days for non-urgent things.

Humans being what they are, the web interface is fastest and sending
email to the robot is faster than sending stuff to the admin.

Many thanks, happy rendering,
Peter

Message-ID: <85B0D777-23CC-11D6-9563-0003930BCBE6@tin.it>

i m still pillo (the beginner)
and now i m wondering if there s a way to calculate  the medium value 
for illuminance (or luminance) on a calculated picture (that isn t but a 
matrix, is it?)

may i use pvalue? how?

excuse me for the question...
i need a seedy answer, so i must ask without trying to solve by myself...


thanks again

The GLASS primitive is optimized for glass of infinitessimal thickness.
You'll probably want to use the DIELECTRIC or INTERFACE material
instead, which allows you to specify the trasmittance per unit length.

See ya!
