Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance, POV-Ray and parallel global illumination?
Message-ID: <5.1.1.6.0.20030201113557.02aca540@mail.attbi.com>

Hello all,
	
	I am a programmer working with the POV-Ray raytracer. As you may know, for 
global illumination, POV-Ray uses a version of the irradiance caching 
algorithm from Mr. Ward's paper "A Ray Tracing Solution for Diffuse 
Interreflection" (Ward, Rubenstein, and Clear). Presumably Radiance uses a 
similar, but more advanced version of the same algorithm for its global 
illumination simulation.

	I'm trying to get parallel rendering working, but there is a problem. If 
the image is divided into tiles, and rendered with POV-Ray and global 
illumination, each finished tile has a different basic brightness level. 
And when the final image is reassembled from the tiles, the effect is like 
a checkerboard or patchwork. In short, it ruins the final image. Apparently 
each render slave *needs* to have the entire scene octree available to it, 
somehow. There has been an effort to share the octree data with the other 
slaves as soon as it is generated, however this is only partially 
successful and does not always suppress the artifacts I mentioned. (Here is 
a link to the pvmegapov page http://www.wozzeck.net/images/pmp/ )

	I'm wondering if Radiance handles this problem in a fundamentally 
different way, which I could learn from. Some basic parallel Radiance info 
I read did not mention this problem at all, so hopefully you guys already 
have a solution. Any suggestions would be most appreciated!


Thanks,
George Pantazopoulos

Hi George,

just to eliminate any potential confusions about the terminology:
What POV calls "scene octree" is normally called "ambient data" in
Radiance-speak. But we're still talking about the same thing.

Your analsysis is correct: You need to share this data between the
different processes in relatively short intervals, or they will
get out of sync, producing the observed tile patterns. Radiance does
the sharing through a file (we're currently discussing alternatives
in the radiance-dev list). Each process synchronizes with this file
when its stdio output buffer is full, on my box that means after it
has created approximately 100 new values.


> I'm wondering if Radiance handles this problem in a fundamentally
> different way, which I could learn from.

As far as I understand what POV does, the main difference seems to
be in the syncing frequency. I see that you have difficulties
increasing that. To improve the quality of the ambient data, it is
common practise with Radiance to "seed" the ambient file with a very
small rendering that is then discarded. Maybe it would help too in
your case, if you let your slaves render and discard one patch each
at first (evenly distributed across the picture), and then to start
the "real" rendering with the ambient data collected that way
already available. In most cases, earlier patches will show bigger
discrepancies than later ones.

Btw., if you really still have tiles in your PvMegaPOV example
picture, the woodgrain pattern hides them very effectively... ;)

Hi Thomas,

a tip from me (I should apologize to Greg for this :-) ) --

do it quick and dirty !
either compile with -Dtracktime=0 or sneak into ambient.c and look for
the calls to the sortambvals() routine. There are only two of them,
disabling them solves all your problems.

Hello

I am currently making an attempt to port Radiance 3.4 into Windows 2000. I 
have a question concerning the aux.h header file. As some of you already 
know, the header file aux.h is reserved exclusively for Windows. I was able 
to get the file onto my hard drive by renaming it aux2.h. What I am curious 
is to know which files (*.c) are associated with this header file. I did a 
text search for "aux.h" to see if it was listed as an <include> directive in 
any files but nothing turned up. I know this file is used somewhere and 
somehow but I don't know where. Please help.

There are quite a lot of encoders. Imagemagick can do it as well as convert 
between image formats (it even reads radiance pictures). A very powerful tool 
to encode or convert video is ffmpeg, it has support for a lot of file 
formats (e.g. avi, mpg, mpg4, and images) and really lots of codecs (e.g. 
mpg, mpg4 / "divx", ...). You should really take a look at this!

That's how I used the projection:

rpict -vta -vh 360 -vv 360 -vp 0 0 1.6 -vd 1 0 0 octree.oct > image.unf

The result will be not a fisheye, but a view to every angle, 360 degrees 
vertically as well as horizontally. So you might try:

rpict -vta -vh 360 -vv 180 -vp 0 0 3 -vd 1 0 0 octree.oct > image.unf
(angular fisheye)

rpict -vth -vh 180 -vv 180 -vp 0 0 3 -vd 1 0 0 octree.oct > image.unf
(hemispherical fisheye)

But, I think you should simply try what you need, using the different 
projections (that's how I do this ;-) And use man rpict - there is a lot of 
info...

CU, Lars.

You know that there is a radiance-dev mailing list on the same
site here? That's where we're discussing non-user topics, and the
issues involved with the imminent porting of 3.4 to Windows are
an important topic of those discussions.  If you haven't
subscribed there yet, I's suggest you do so and also consult the
recent archives, so you can avoid doing any duplicate work, or
going off on a tangent that conflicts with other plans.

Please note specifically, that the most recent version of 3.4
will be made available on public CVS soon. It has also seen a
number of changes since the version that you're probably working
with. Specifically, Greg has started with the ANSIfication of the
code, which will make porting much easier. You might want to wait
with any of your changes until you can apply them to the cutting
edge, so that they can be merged back into the official code base
with less effort.

It currently looks like I might become responsible for
coordinating the Windows porting efforts, but I'm sure nobody
will object to other people doing at least part of the work.
I also hope that LBNL will allow me to use code from the Windows
version 3.2 as included in Desktop Radiance and Rayfront (the
latter with some improvements of my own).  We won't be able to
just copy those sources, as they are based on a Radiance version
that was forked off the main code base earlier on, but there are
some parts that might reduce the amount of work we'll have to do.

As to the actual question, the header file aux.h seems to be a
part of the OpenGL/X11 API, and is sometimes named glaux.h.
I don't see it actually in use anywhere, so you're probably save
to just leave it away.

Hi Marcus,

I would strongly recommend that you wait for the 3.5 release due out 
the end of this month before doing any more work on this port.  We plan 
to get a coordinated effort going on unifying the Radiance code for 
Unix and Windows, and will be asking others to help us at that time.

Having said that, you can safely ignore the "aux.h" file in src/common 
-- this must have come from some OpenGL toolkit that may have been used 
or needed at one time, but now is just flotsam in the code tree.  In 
fact, I eliminated this file since the 3.4 release, and it won't be 
found in future releases.

Hi Gurneet,

I can't answer your first question as I know nothing about available 
tools for movie conversion under Linux, but I'm sure there's something, 
somewhere.  On a Mac, you would need the "professional" version of 
QuickTime to do this, I think.

Regarding a fish-eye lens, there are two types built into rpict -- 
hemispherical and angular fisheye projections.  These are explained 
(along with everything else) in the rpict man page.  If you have 
trouble looking at this from the distribution, try the website:

	http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/man_html/whatis.html

Note however that some of these will be out of date, since the website 
has not been synchronized with the release in many a moon.

I'm not sure how refined the implementation already is for mortal
users, but the principle of how to do this is presented here:

Subject: [Radiance-general] Solaris Compiles again...

Hi!

Does anybody have a license of Sun Forte C allowing him to build some 
Radiance binaries for Ultrasparc II / III?

I have LOTS of trouble here to compile radiance on Solaris at all (the old 
sys_nerr, sys_errlist thing, I had to change my include files, changing only 
radiance's error.c didn't help), and the binaries produced by gcc 3.2.2 
(32bit, I didn't get it to compile radiance as 64 bit app, and I also don't 
know if this would improve things) are not really performant. I tried the 
"radiance-benchmerk2" by Paul Bourke, and got results for my Ultrasparc III 
CPUs equal to P4s at the same frequencies. I hope that Sun's native compilers 
would help here a lot.

Is it worth tryiing to use Sun's optimized math libraries with radiance?

CU, Lars.
