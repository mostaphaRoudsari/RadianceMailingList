Dear Group

Does anyone know where to access the latest version of POV2RAD. Also, does 
anyone know if the latest version can parse POVRAY 3.5 files and translate 
the u-v mapping?

Thanks

Marcus

Subject: [Radiance-general] Building Radiance 3.5 on Tru64
Message-ID: <E19XdiK-0001S1-00@unix.ccc.nottingham.ac.uk>

Hello,

Has anyone any experience building Radiance 3.5 on Compaq tru64
systems ?  I am trying this, and having some difficulty.

Initially, I was getting errors in the librt build due to conflicting
definitions of random functions.  I have cut down the file random.h
to a minimum (included below) and now can get all the programs built
without errors (although warnings are quite numerous).

On running the oconv program on a file cut from the tutorial I get:

cropwell2$ /opt/pkg/radiance/bin/oconv room.rad
#?RADIANCE
/opt/pkg/radiance/bin/oconv room.rad
FORMAT=Radiance_octree

/opt/pkg/radiance/bin/oconv: fatal - bad # arguments for light "bright"


the room.rad is also included below.  Any advice would be welcome.

regards,

Colin Bannister

Unless people feel strongly otherwise, I'm going to suggest we move 
this discussion to the radiance-dev list.

The error you get from oconv suggests that its getting confused about 
basic types, as the "bad # arguments" should not show up at all unless 
it thinks the light is a sphere or a face or something.

My first suggestion is that you try building from CVS head, which may 
be found on the radiance-online.org site under the "download Radiance" 
link.  Download the current experimental bug-fix version, called 
radiance-HEAD.tgz, and compile from that.  If you still get compile 
errors with the latest random.h, please forward them directly to me and 
I'll see what I can do.  It's probably best to send me the entire 
output of makeall.

Message-ID: <EF5077DDD024D411B6B100C0DFE0D9342DF319@SERVER01>

Hi Reinhart

I hope you don't mind, I'm copying this back to the general list in the hope
of more help.
The search paths I have used are: "MACH= -DBIGMEM -L/usr/X11R6/lib
-I/usr/X11R6/include" 
These correspond with my Linux version and successfully compile the
following:

arch2rad.exe, compamb, dayfact, debugcal, dev, findglare.exe, genblinds.exe,
genbox.exe, genclock.exe, genprism.exe, genrev.exe, gensky.exe, gensurf.exe,
genworm.exe, getbbox.exe, getinfo.exe, glare, glarendx.exe, glaze,
ies2rad.exe, lampcolor.exe, lookamb.exe, mgf2inv.exe, mgf2meta.exe,
mgf2rad.exe, mgfilt.exe, mkillum.exe, nff2rad.exe, obj2mesh.exe,
obj2rad.exe, objline, objpict, objview, oconv.exe, rad.exe, rad2mgf.exe,
raddepend, ranimate.exe, ranimove.exe, replmarks.exe, rlux, rpict.exe,
rpiece.exe, rtrace.exe, rview.exe, thf2rad.exe, tmesh2rad.exe, vinfo,
vwrays.exe, vwright.exe, xform.exe, xglaresrc.exe

I made one trip back to the Cygwin website to fetch some X11 header files I
did not get the first time.

Sure enough, as Carsten suggested some commands compiled, but did not
transfer to the bin directory:
Under /ray/src/px/ I find the following: 

macbethcal.exe, oki20.exe, oki20c.exe, pcomb.exe, pcompos.exe, pcond.exe,
pcwarp.exe, pextrem.exe, pfilt.exe, pflip.exe, pinterp.exe, protate.exe,
psign.exe, pvalue.exe, ra_avs.exe, ra_bn.exe, ra_gif.exe, ra_hexbit.exe,
ra_pict.exe, ra_ppm.exe, ra_pr.exe, ra_pr24.exe, ra_ps.exe, ra_rgbe.exe,
ra_t16.exe, ra_t8.exe, ra_xyze.exe, ttyimage.exe, ximage.exe, xshowtrace.exe
(plus some scripts)

Of course even after transferring the files across it doesn't work: 

"rview: cannot open X-windows: DISPLAY variable set?
rview fatal - cannot initialize X11"

What went wrong? This is the output from stderr during installation:

--------------------------------------------------------------

It looks like cygwin needs further configuration and I've still got a few
errors on the Radiance installation. 

Unfortunately I don't have the time to pursue this right now. Any pointers
from other users would be most welcome.

Hi Bruce,
 
I have seen your  recent  posting on the RADIANCE-general mailing list and I
wonder whether you have succeeded by now installing RADIANCE using cygwin? I
am at a similar stage as you have been  when you wrote the posting. I get
most programs compiled except for the ones using X11. Have you figured out
which path to specify under gcc instead of "-L/usr/X11R6/lib"?   Greetings

Hi,

>rview fatal - cannot initialize X11"

this means X-dependent stuff already got compiled, ximage is in
your list, too, now there's only the problem to get it started.

if you're using bash as shell, try issuing

$> export DISPLAY=:0

before starting ximage xy.pic or rview

You also need an X server to be running for ximage (and
rview etc.) to work. It's too long since I tried this
myself, so someone else will have to come forward with
a recommendation.

Message-ID: <sf0e7b0d.086@sydnws04>

Hi Jochen,

There are several annual daylight simulation tools that use Radiance.  Two of these are DAYSIM (http://irc.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ie/light/daysim.html) and the Dynamic Lighting System (http://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~pcc/dls/).  They both use similar techniques (daylight coefficients), but run in different ways.  Both are free to download.

I haven't used DLS, but have DAYSIM, and it's a pleasure to use.  it can give you daylight illuminances at given points for every hour (or more often) of the daylit year.  you can also set a threshold level and it will provide daylight autonomies at the given points.  daylight autonomy describes how often the natural illumination at a point exceeds the threshold value.  with the hourly (or more often) daylight illuminances, you can calculate your annual luxhours.

John Mardaljevic's web site (http://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm/) also describes an algorithm for predicting solar penetration.  this will give you annual sunhours, or equivalent.  the algorithm isn't yet available, but contact John if you'd like more info.

good luck!
Phil.

Hi,

I'm trying to learn Radiance and got stuck with the following error

Any ideas as to what I'm doing wrong (below)?

You did study the obj2mesh man page, right?


   Obj2mesh reads a Wavefront .OBJ file from input.obj (or the
   standard input) and compiles it into a RADIANCE triangle mesh,
   which is sent to output.rtm (or standard output). [...] This
   mesh may be included in a RADIANCE scene description via the
   mesh primitive, thus:

         mod mesh id
         1+ output.rtm [xform args]
         0
         0


A compiled mesh file is not a normal Radiance scene file,
so you can't feed it directly into oconv. Use a mesh
primitive as explained in the man page and make sure
that it points to the right file. Then let oconv process
the file containing the mesh primitive.

Not carefully enough apparently.  It said the mesh "*may*
be included in a Radiance scene description...", so I
assumed that was just an optional way to reference it.
I didn't realize it was required.  I should have tried it though.

Thanks for the help.

Subject: [Radiance-general] obj2mesh and materials
Message-ID: <3F1225F4.4070502@semanticlight.com>

I can't seem to get obj2mesh to recognize
materials.  From the man page it seems as though
it should.  It says:

"Any RADIANCE material descriptions included via one
 or more -a options will be compiled and stored in the mesh
 as well."

It doesn't specify the format of the -a material descriptions.  Is it a rad
file with normal material defintions in it?   I tried that and it didn't 
seem
to work. 

Here's the output I get from obj2mesh on a .obj file
with a dozen materials.  It seems as though it doesn't
recognize them. 

Mesh statistics:
    0 materials
    16 patches (0.08 MBytes)
    3879 vertices (0.0% w/ normals, 0.0% w/ uv)
    7742 triangles (78.5% local, 20.6% joiner)
    8289 leaves in octree (34.3% empty, 6.84 avg. set size)

Are there any examples on how to do this?

I figured out the problem...I put the "-a <materialfile>" option
after the input .obj file rather than before it.   It didn't complain, 
and I didn't
notice.

I switched them around and it works.  Sorry for the false alarm.

One other question.  Is there a way to override the values
of materials on individual groups in meshes?  I'd like to override
them individually from the outside so separate instances can have
different attributes.  I don't want to have to create new meshes just
to change some materials on groups.

This is really a bug, which I've now fixed.  You should generally 
expect Radiance programs to check the command-line arguments for gross 
errors, but it doesn't really do so consistently.

Just like octree instances, the only way to substitute materials is 
wholesale.  You can't control individual groups that have been compiled 
into a mesh; you can only replace the mesh materials with one material 
that covers all objects in that mesh, and you do this by specifying a 
material modifier to the "mesh" primitive (rather than using "void").  
If you want to control materials in mesh groups, which I agree is a 
perfectly reasonable thing to want to do, you must break your groups 
into individual .OBJ files and convert them one by one with obj2mesh, 
reassembling them with an appropriate set of "mesh" primitives, whose 
materials you may then control.

Hello Jochen,

I have done such kind of RADIANCE calculations by using "annual mean skies" 
models produced from hourly beam and diffuse irradiance data (obtained from 
the METEONORM software). Here is a stereographic projection showing the 
annual mean sky for Fribourg (Switzerland) using a falsecolor scale that 
maps the radiance values:
Fribourg_msky00.tif        radiance_scale.tif
The sky vault is subdivided in 145 zones as defined by the CIE.

The corresponding RADIANCE scene file (F00.rad) is attached hereafter with 
the generic treg_sky.rad file. As indicated at the beginning of the file, 
the mean radiance values are computed over the daylit hours only. If you 
make a RADIANCE simulation under such a sky model (using rpict option -i), 
you get mean irradiance values in [W/m2]. If you want irradiation values in 
[Wh/m2], you just need to multiply the results by the number of hours 
indicated at the beginning of the file.
Note that in this sky model, the red, green and blue channels contain 
respectively diffuse, direct and total mean radiance values. To extract one 
of this component filter your picture like that:

to get the direct irradiance only: pcomb -e 'lo=gi(1)' 
original_picture.pic >direct_only.pic
or to get the total irradiance: pcomb -e 'lo=bi(1)' 
original_picture.pic >total.pic

Of course, due to this "unusual" way of using the RGB channels, it is not 
possible to use such a sky model with coloured materials. Such models have 
to be used with "gray" surfaces where the r,g,b materials parameters are 
the same (=surface overall reflectances).

With a similar approach I also prepared a mean sky model for daylighting 
studies (F00dl.rad). For such a model only the working hours (from 8am to 
6pm) are averaged. The daylight saving time period is also considered. 
Again if you make a RADIANCE simulation under such a sky model (using rpict 
option -i), you directly get mean illuminance values in [lx].
If you want light exposure values in [lx hours], then just multiply the 
results by the number of hours considered in the model. The model uses the 
same RGB channels separation as explained above.

Hope this can help you.

R. Compagnon

Message-ID: <00758D96-B727-11D7-9AE1-00306540F848@lmi.net>

INITIAL CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

	LBNL Radiance Workshop, September 22-26, Berkeley, California

We are planning a second workshop on scientific applications of 
Radiance, this time in Berkeley, hosted by the Lawrence Berkeley 
National Laboratory.

The first part of the week, Sept. 22-24, we will offer intermediate and 
advanced tutorials in Radiance, covering (among other things) daylight 
applications and new features introduced in recent Radiance versions, 
such as the holodeck and the mesh primitive.  On Thursday and Friday, 
we will provide a forum for researchers to present their  work to other 
attendees.  We will also discuss current Open Source development 
efforts and solicit ideas on future directions for the software.

At this time, we are asking for immediate feedback from people who are 
interested in attending so that we can confirm a budget and pricing for 
the event.  This is our current proposal for the registration fee 
schedule:

	Tutorials Only (22-24):	400 USD	($200 for students)
	Seminar Only (25-26):	200 USD  ($100 for students)
	Seminar and Tutorials:	500 USD  ($250 for students)

To qualify for the student rates, you must be currently enrolled in a 
graduate or undergraduate program at a university.  Presenters will be 
offered a uniform $100 discount on their registration, at most one 
discount per talk/presenter.  (E.g., if you are a professional 
attending the entire week and presenting two talks at the seminar, your 
registration fee will be $400.  A student presenter attending the 
seminar only pays no registration fee.)  These rates will probably 
undergo some adjustments when we find out how many people are 
interested in attending.  The more people who speak up and the sooner 
they do so, the less it will cost for everybody.

Tentatively, John Mardaljevic has agreed to repeat his two-day 
intermediate daylight simulation course for us, and Greg Ward plans to 
give a one-day tutorial on new Radiance features.  If others are 
interested to present a tutorial, please contact the organizers 
immediately by sending e-mail to:

	<workshop@radsite.lbl.gov>

If you are interested in presenting your work at the seminar, please 
send a talk title and brief description of its content  to the e-mail 
address above.  If you have an abstract ready, please include it, but 
we don't require one at this point.  Deadline for talk titles is July 
31.  If you plan to attend, but are not sure if you will be able to 
give a talk, or are sure you will not, we would still like to hear from 
you by the 31st so we can get an approximate head count.  Let us know 
whether you would like to attend the tutorials, the seminar, or both.

We intend to announce the final workshop pricing along with a 
speculative list of talks in early August.  Registration payment will 
be due towards the end of August.  We will offer suggestions for 
accommodations in the area in the next announcement.

If you accidentally REPLY to this e-mail, be aware that you will end up 
sending your thoughts to the entire list, so use the above address, 
instead.

I look forward to seeing you in September!
-Greg

Hello all!

Could someone please point me to an install guide for Radiance on Linux? =
It runs, but when I get to the 'add a window' portion of the fist =
tutorial, rview can't find a library it needs. I followed Greg's advice =
to a former poster on the list that had a simular problem, and copied =
all the libraries to there correct location, but still no dice. This =
makes me think that they are either not in the proper location or some =
other configuration is not proper.

If there is a simple list of 'proper' file locations for radiance that =
someone could point me to I would be most grateful! The pre-complied =
binaries run without issue; I just can't get them to find the libraries, =
no matter where I locaate them! If I could have a list as to where =
everything goes, then I would know if it was simply my path settings or =
if there are deeper problems.

Thanks,

Jeffrey

p.s. this is on Mndrke Linux 9.0=20

Subject: [Radiance-general] AutoCAD to Radiance
Message-ID: <PIEDLHDIABINEAGKJLLHEEFLCAAA.shakespe@indiana.edu>

It has been several years since I needed to convert AutoCAD geometry into
Radiance scene descriptions for use in a LINUX environment. I have filters
dating back to the early 1990's. Please advise me about the availability of
more recent, efficient filters which might run within AutoCAD 2000+. I do
realize that Desktop Radiance will provide geometry conversion... I am
trying to avoid loading the whole package, when all I need is an output text
file.

Thanks much,

Rob Shakespeare

   This is an Autocad application that will export all selected
   geometry except ACIS solid modelling entities. ACIS solids
   are only supported by the version included with Rayfront (note
   that DR only converts a very limited subset of of ACIS, Rayfront
   does the full thing).


  http://www.schorsch.com/download/dxf2rad/

   Standalone application available for several platforms. No ACIS
   support at all, since that would require the use of expensive 3rd
   party libraries.

Rob,

Radout is an export routine that runs in Autocad 2000. It is available 
from Georg Mischler at www.schorsch.com at the following link:

http://www.schorsch.com/download/radout

Georg has a variety of powerful tools ranging from his Rayfront package 
(a Radiance based simulation application) to utilities such as Radout.

Hi Jeffrey,

I guess we really need a FAQ...  I would have gotten to this earlier, 
but I was off for a little vacation.  I'm surprised no one else fielded 
it.

You need to set the RAYPATH variable to include . and whatever 
directory you've used for the Radiance libraries.  Also, there is a 
problem when you install from binaries, which is that certain .cal 
files (such as rayinit.cal) are considered "source" files and are not 
included when you download the distribution and run "makeall library".  
I have fixed this for the next release, but in the meantime, you need 
to run the following command from the ray/ directory:

	cp -f src/*/*.{cal,tab,hex} /usr/local/lib/ray

This assumes that you are using /usr/local/lib/ray to hold your 
Radiance libraries, in which case you should add the following to your 
.cshrc file:

	setenv RAYPATH .:/usr/local/lib/ray

I hope that fixes it.  Again, I apologize for the frustration and the 
delay.
-Greg
