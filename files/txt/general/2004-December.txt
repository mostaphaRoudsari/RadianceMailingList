Hi!

That's true, however, if this was the problem, he should simply get the 
wrong program (vi) started, no such error message.

>> ""dyld: rview can't open library: /usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.6.dylib  (No 
>> such  file or directory, errno = 2)Trace/BPT trap""

By the way, did you check if this library exists on your system? Try: 
ls /usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.6.*

The file is there on my OS X 10.3.6 machine and should be installed if 
you have X11-support!

One more hint, you can perfectly remote-control linux- and other 
ix-machines from your OS X laptop using ssh, even X11-windows can be 
redirected to your laptop. IMHO it's better to use "real" computers for 
large renderings, I don't like to overheat my laptop by having 100% cpu 
for hours...

I will make some 3.6 binaries and provide them on my binary-pages as 
soon as I find the time.

I wonder if anyone on this list has experience in printing 32 bit floating
point images (radiance pics preferably)? Some years ago I had some vibrant
discussion with Iebele Abel on this matter. I find it a rather frustrating
idea to thrash spending much time and effort getting a physically accurate
rendered image, and thrashing a tremendous amount of image fidelility to get
the image printed, there where it counts most. I've been able to get 16-bit
data images, but what I'm interested in is getting the full scope.
The relevant question indeed is what would be limiting output quality.
Its quite likely paper of photographic means are only able to output so many
colours. I refer to physical limitations, rather than those implied by a
data format. 

It seems that film industry has successfully overcome getting lack of colour
fidelity, also thank to the openEXR format (basically a clumsy rip-off of
the radiance image format??) but mostly by actually being able to output the
full scope of the data.

So how would I get this done in print, its quite a concern to me.

Best,

Jelle.

Jelle,

This is a very interesting question, and one in which I have an
interest in following. I'll share with you my limited knowledge.

It has been my knowledge from speaking and reading about display
devices (mainly reflective print and transparency film) that film
can record a greater range of brightnesses, allowing it greater
bit depth. Print is hindered by its reflective nature, and the
upper and lower bounds of reflectivity (users of Radiance are
more aware than most that what is normally percieved as white is
probably no more than 70-80% reflective).

I have been assured by professional digital printers that a
good 8-bit-per-channel image gets printed just as well as an
image with grater depth. I may have even been told that the
rasterizer upgrades the bit depth as it upsamples the image.
I can't confirm that, though.

I usually print on a Lightjet 5000. I use ra_tiff to convert my
.pic into a 16-bit-per-channel TIFF, then I use Cinepaint on
Linux to do final adjustments, outputting to an 8bpc TIFF.

Jelle,

Like Mark I will add in what I know and what we have done in the past to 
get the best quality prints possible (for a reasonable cost).

In general you need to print to a print device that goes direct rgb. I 
think that a fair amount of progress has been made for printing digital 
images (rgb) direct to photographic quality paper (paper makes a huge 
difference). We have had good success with two devices and one service:

   1. Lambda Printer - this is a big fancy printer that only a large
      service bureau would have (I think that the cost around $500,000
      US). They can print to very large paper sizes (photo paper). I do
      not remember what the resolution is, although we found that you
      could have quite good image quality even at 100dpi. Cost - expensive.
   2. Kodak Pegasus Printer- cannot print as large as the lambda but is
      direct to photo paper. Is more sensitive to image resolution, I
      think they prefer 250dpi. Cost - medium to expensive.
   3. Online Service Bureaus - we have also used Ofoto on occasion.
      Again the print is direct to photo paper. Cost - INEXPENSIVE!

Depending on the device selected, I expect that one could also prepare 
some kind of calibration to make sure the images are calibrated to the 
device (which means that you have to make sure your other output devices 
such as monitors are correctly calibrated as well).

Of course none of this answers your question about bit depth. I guess 
one question to ask is how much is needed to achieve what you want. 
Alternatively, another way to look at it is to learn what professional 
photographers using high end digital cameras do for printing, I can only 
imagine that this could get quite expensive however.

I just started to peruse chapter 15 in RwR on multiprocessor rendering.
Is that all still valid info for Radiance 3.6.1?
Can anyone tell me any pitfalls to avoid?

Hi!

> In general you need to print to a print device that goes direct rgb.

??? You mean a driver that can do the rgb to cmyk translation, without the
need to do that in an application? Just wondering, I never heard about
rgb-printers, do you mean transfering to a film (which is like foto and as
such rgb)?

Regarding printers, it is a big help to use printers that don't offer just
cmyk, but also the light colors (there are 6 and 8 color printers), as this
avoids raster problems in bright regions of your renderings.

Calibration... afaik the radiance output is close to srgb, so if you have an
output profile for your printer (icc), this should be easy. There is also
macbethcal which could be used to make a simple output calibration, however,
I never used it (I tried once).

I can't imagine that the bit per channel question is really relevant (for
inkjet printing), because the limitations of paper and the raster technique
used to mix the colors.

I will have to do some large-format printouts of radiance pictures (which
have to be rendered first ;-) for an exhibition next march, as such I am
interested in the topic.

CU Lars.

This is where the Lightjet family of printers is different. They
upsample the image to ~4000dpi and expose photographic paper with
lasers. I suppose they use red, green, and blue lasers, but I
have no documented proof. I have been very happy with the output.
If you managed to make it to SIGGRAPH in the last 3 years, you
may have seen these samples of Radiance-rendered work, in
large-format, hanging in the Art Gallery.

I find that when I call a professional photo/printing business
and start talking technical, I get forwarded to the specialist,
who takes something of an interest once I mention that I have no
ICC profiles, and my work isn't from a Mac or a PC.  I've learned
that (if I set my monitor's gamma to ~2.2) what I see on my
monitor looks very much like what gets printed when I dictate
"assign no profile" or "assign sRGB." Maybe the sRGB one looks a
little more "correct," or a little less saturated. I have a hard
time telling the difference.

Another bit of advice: learn about the printer that you're using,
and send it the best possible pixels that you can. Insist that
they print at that resolution. Most printers are used to folks
printing enlargements of bad photos. It helps to talk to the
person who will actually run the machine and explain that there
is minute detail that is important. For the Lightjet 5000, I
always send a 300 dpi file, and I always antialias by pfilt'ing
my final rendering down at least 3:1 (sometimes more).

I hope my experiences have helped. It has taken me quite a few
years to learn how to "talk the talk" and get a good image
printed.

Hi Lars,

Yes, as I understand these photographic printers (eg direct to photo 
paper), such as the Lambda and Pegasus, print RGB not CMYK. The nice 
thing about this is there is no mucking about with conversion from one 
colorspace to the other. They use red, green and blue lasers to expose 
the paper. Do a web search for Durst Lambda to learn more or check out:

http://www.durst-online.com/uk/produkte.asp?pid=2&hid=

I think that the kodak product may be different, perhaps some kind of 
LED to expose the paper.

Well, one nice new thing is that Greg added the -N option to rad in 
version 3.6, so that you'll be able to do just what you describe.  In 
your case, you'd call rad with -N 2 (for two processors).  It seems 
pretty much point-n-shoot, with that option.  Have fun!

Hi,

cmyk is probably a bit out of date nowadays, it always was a rather poor 
standard suitable for those big printing machines of former time. As 
already mentioned, the best way today is to use those new fancy laser 
printers which use rgb directly without color space conversion.

Apart from color fidelity, another question which might come into play 
is to apply a tonemapping process on the HDR image before converting it 
to rgb. The old Radiance had the pquish script, the newer versions have 
the 'pcomp' program for that purpose. This applys a partially nonlinear 
compression to preserve detail in the highlight/dark regions which 
otherwise would be over/underexposed, in other words it allows to 
compress the image to a contrast range fitting that of the output 
machine (which definitely is the final limiting factor in the whole chain)

not really my field of expertise, but -
probably one should measure the spectral reflectance of each printed 
primary color to come with a good color calibration ? Or is that purely 
academic ?
I had found it rather difficult to get a feel what the a laser printer 
does internally, what happens between the RGB values in the PS or PDF 
file and the beam intensity. Has the user enough control over that 
process to justify a calibration ? Anyone got (negative ?) experiences 
to reproduce colors and shades between self-calibrations of a printer ?

Iebele,

Most of the results on

http://mark.technolope.org/pages/rad_bench.html

are from Linux workstations with 2.4 kernels. The fastest
processors for the particular scene tested are Opteron 246s,
though there are few recent tests of P4s to compare with.

Is there anyone out there with a fast P4?

Mark

I think you mean 'pcond'.  And yes, the tonemapping that pcond offers is 
very useful for generating "more printable" images.  I use it all the 
time.  Stuff like pcond -h is what separates Radiance from the rest!

The pigments on a print will almost always be cymk (sometimes
augmented with additional colors). This has nothing to do with
"big machines of former time", but simply with the laws of
physics.

The only difference is that *you* don't need the printer's color
profile for doing the conversion yourself. The conversion module
of the printer has that built in. To think that there will be no
conversion at all (not sure if you really do think so) would be
naive. This is even the case for machines that directly expose
photographic paper with rgb lasers (which of course will activate
cym[k] pigments in the paper, introducing yet another "conversion").

If you're really picky, then that would be the most accurate
method to generate the color profile for a printer. In practise,
visual comparisons against a reference print may be good enough
in most cases.

That's what color profiles are there for. In the times of color
profiles, the mechanics of how that reflectance gets on paper
should be irrelevant to the user.

All of this of course assumes that you know the color space of
your own data. It seems that the Radiance color space is quite
close to SRGB, which is highly convenient. Once you know that,
you either use the color profile of your printer to do a
(SRGB->"printer rgb" or SRGB->"Printer cymk") conversion
yourself, or you let the printer know that it will get SRGB data
and have it do the same conversion internally. If you get bad
results that way, then either the color profile is wrong or the
printer is broken.

At least that's how I understand the theory... ;)

Hi Mark,

Today with this processor:

model name      : Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4 CPU 3.00GHz
cpu MHz         : 2992.578

512 Mb of RAM, linux 2.4.26 patched with openmosix and
compiling radiance with gcc 3.3.4 and these compile options

-Dlinux -DMC -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -L/usr/X11R6/lib -I/usr/include/X11
-DNOSTEREO -march=pentium4 -malign-double -mno-ieee-fp -mfpmath=sse -O3
-ffast-math -fomit-frame-pointer -fstrict-aliasing -ftracer

I got this:

 14.54 for oconv
222.13 for rpict 
  0.29 for pfilt

Using openmosix with my 2 node cluster 
(
the second machine has a different processor:
model name      : Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4 CPU 2.26GHz
cpu MHz         : 2254.028
)

and rpiece with a 4x4 grid subdivision I got:

156.92 for rpict

I could do a better time with a symmetric system, but
the AMD Opteron seems to rule ...

The opteron results were with gcc, my experience with
(non-radiance) benchmarks on opteron 246 and 250s
shows significant improvements using the intel
compiler in 32-bit mode and the PathScale compiler in
64-bit mode.

Don't know how much of an improvement intel/pathscale
will provide on radiance, but previous experience with
similar application profiles shows a performance boost
of 15-45% depending on the specific application.

We have two new dual opteron 246s running 64 bit linux (2.6.8) (Fedora 
Core 2). Compiling with -m64 -O3 seems to produce faster code, but I 
have not done any intensive testing yet. We have been running AMDs 
(athlon mps) for quite a while and been very happy with the price 
performance. Someone did mention that the performance of  the Intel EM64 
(don't know if this is P4 or Xeon) may be pretty good as well, but I 
really do not have any data points on this.

I tried sending this yesterday, but used the wrong sending address and 
had it rejected...

During my hiatus from physically-based rendering in 1999-2001, I was 
employed as a software engineer at Shutterfly, Inc.  I worked 
intimately with their digital photographic printers, which went 
directly from 24-bit RGB images to photo paper via LED and fluorescent 
line-exposure units.  From this experience, I can assure you that the 
best printers cannot reproduce a black darker than 1%, which doesn't 
include the 3% reflection you get off the surface coating.  In other 
words, a glossy print, angled so that the specular reflection mirrors 
something black, produces a maximum contrast no better than 100:1.  In 
an uncontrolled environment where the glossy reflection is not black, 
the maximum contrast can degrade terribly, to as little as 2:1 or 
worse.  (That's why people looking at high contrast prints always angle 
them to minimize reflections.)

Although it is theoretically and physically possible to produce prints 
with better than 100:1 contrast, the surface reflection described will 
undermine this contrast to where there is little point in improving it 
further.  This is most likely why no one has bothered.  Viewers in a 
typical ambient environment simply cannot appreciate additional depth 
in the shadows.  As Mark pointed out, there is nowhere to go on the top 
end, as the best photo paper has a maximum reflectance around 90%.  So 
much for reflection prints.

However, it is possible to get excellent dynamic range out of film 
transparencies.  A well-made transparency, viewed through a slide 
projector or light table, can have a dynamic range of 1000:1 or better. 
  What's more, you can actually SEE the detail in the shadows and 
highlights with a transparency, unlike a reflection print where you're 
constantly fighting with the background.  Unfortunately, I haven't 
found any reasonably priced digital film recorders or services that do 
a good job of taking higher resolution pixel data and converting it to 
a wide range of densities, and this is largely a problem with the D/A 
converters they employ.  There is no reason I know why they couldn't do 
better, and there are probably Hollywood post-production labs that 
acheive much better image depth, but they are quite expensive and not 
widely used at this time.  In the consumer market, there is nothing.

Around the corner -- in the next year or two -- you can expect to see 
high dynamic range display devices enter the commercial market.  I am 
working with a Canadian company, Sunnybrook Technologies, that has made 
great strides in this direction.  For more information, you can check 
out this year's Siggraph paper on the topic:

Seetzen, Helge, W. Heidrich, W. Stuezlinger, G. Ward,  L. Whitehead, M. 
Trentacoste, A. Ghosh, A. Vorozcovs,  "High Dynamic Range  Display 
Systems," ACM Trans. Graph. (special  issue SIGGRAPH 2004), August 
2004.  <http://www.anyhere.com/gward/papers/Siggraph04.pdf>

Ultimately, I think HDR displays are the best way to appreciate 
lighting simulations.  Until then, we're kind of stuck with low 
dynamic-range, tone-mapped prints and displays.

If anyone knows of a digital path to high-contrast transparencies, I'd 
love to hear about it.

-Greg

P.S.  Regarding the OpenEXR format.  It is not a cheap rip-off of 
Radiance's RGBE format by any stretch of the imagination.  It is a more 
accurate format that is valuable for post-production and special 
effects image processing, and a very well thought-out library.  For a 
comparison of various HDR image formats, check out my web page on the 
subject.

Wow, thanks for all your feedback!
 
Seems like the lightjet is an interesting machine.
Generally I'm on par with Jack, I share his view on quality / cost effective
printing.
I had to think about the idea of colout fidelity seeing the art work of Yves
Klein.
Its interesting to see art which main focus is pure colour.
The interesting thing here is that with Radiance, it really isn't difficult
at all to produce this pure kind of colour, your just not being able to get
it out of your machine. I've been printing with Durst Lambda on light boxes,
which is quite an excellent technique, but in the light of pure pigment
colours, everything just looks faint. Hence the quest for 32 bit floating
point output. Looking at the VIPS software 
(Supports a large range of numeric types Images can contain 8-, 16- and
32-bit integers, signed or unsigned, 32- and 64-bit floats, and 64- and
128-bit complex numbers, http://www.vips.ecs.soton.ac.uk/vips.php) it seems
that this issue addressed here is relevant.
What good is all that data if your not able to get its full output. Actually
I tried to be in touch with the developers at Durst, to give them the
stunning idea of making a floating point Lamba driver for free, alas, no
response. Looks like this is a dead end so far. Thanks for all your
responses!

Greg,

Thanks for the valuable feedback!

Concerning the limited dynamic range of paper-like based prints, we've moved
to using transparencies and lightboxes for our output. We've been producing
this output with Durst Lambda printers, which use the same kind of colour
interpolation as the Lightjet printer.
Deep black is difficult to produce in this manner, since the material is
indeed quite reflective, and the backlit nature of lightboxes inherently
doenst do justice to pure black. The most beautifully printed black I've
seen so far was done with Gyclee printers, using up to 11 'ultra wide
gamuth' inks. These prints were done on matte paper, what's beautiful about
it is that the black is almost like powder, the detail and depth in the
black is nothing but astonishing. (see http://www.colorspan.com)

The idea of working with a Hollywood based company is an option in the sense
that its sure they have the technology to do it, but the size of ouput is
for the film industry is rather different than what I'm looking for (35mm
for ordinary film, 70mm for IMAX). Still I'll see if this could be an option
we could pursue.

"Ultimately, I think HDR displays are the best way to appreciate 
lighting simulations.  Until then, we're kind of stuck with low 
dynamic-range, tone-mapped prints and displays."

I couldn't agree more. Somehow I have the feeling hacking a 32 bit colour
Durst lambda driver could be an option. Since I'm not a programmer/physicist
I'm not sure if this suggestion is valid, but what if one could produce
multiple exposed lambda prints? Could building up the exposure increase the
depth of the printed output.

--- I realize discussing the particulars of a machine for output is somewhat
off-topic for this list... ---

Sorry for my uninformed openEXR bashing... consider it an over enthousiastic
expression for my affection of Radiance ;-)
Thanks for the link/paper considering this topic, it's a wealth of
information to get to the bottom of this! Looking forward for this book!

Cheers,

Jelle.

Message-ID: <41AF6273.5030807@rumblestrip.org>

I'm interested in possibly doing a digital mockup of a store window. 
The window will have a translucent graphic applied to the glass, and 
will be lit from behind.  I'm hoping to be able to scan an image from 
the store's catalog and map that to the glass window, or perhaps to a 
intermediate polygon modeled with trans.  I'm expecting to get a sample 
of the graphic material so I can estimate the transmission; I'm 
wondering how to accurately simulate this in Radiance.

I know Carsten created a new image format and primitive (color4pict) to 
facilitate some of this, but the gist of how to do this escapes me at 
the moment.  Could the group offer suggestions on how to accomplish this?

 Even so, I still get the image like that. I'm really confused. How
to get a satisfying result?

	Hi, all,
	     I've attached my image with this mail. I was just
	struggling for the soft shadows. This is my parameters for rpict:
	     rpict -vf default.vp -ps 1 -aa .08 -ab 2 -ad 512 -as 256 -ar 128
	-dj .6 -ds .1 -x 12288 -y 9216 scene.oct > scene.pic
	 I made such a large image to get 12 times oversample. I then filter
	it down. This is for pfilt:
	     pfilt -e .4 -r .7 -x 1024 -y 768 scene.pic > scene_filt.pic
	 Even so, I still get the image like that. I'm really confused. How
	to get a satisfying result?
	
	cheers,

Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance Transparent Mirror Material
Message-ID: <mailman.3.1102015693.370.radiance-general@radiance-online.org>

Hi all,

 

I am a student from Bristol University in the UK currently rendering a scene
which includes a desk lamp with a halogen bulb.

 

The bulb is similar to the one at the following address:

http://www.lightworld.com/MERCHANT2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD
<http://www.lightworld.com/MERCHANT2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&Product_Code=97
88&Category_Code=halogen> &Product_Code=9788&Category_Code=halogen

 

I am trying to replicate the reflective, transparent inner surface of the
light cone, does anyone have any ideas on how I can make the mirror material
have a degree of transparency so I can accurately represent light leaving
the rear of the bulb.

 

Many thanks in advance,

 

Tom Wood

I was going to suggest -dj 0.9 and compile with the -DMC option.

hmm, if it were for the physics alone, we wouldn't need the k, so we'll 
have to take chemistry and engineering (and of course physiology) into 
account, also. In most high-quality printing jobs (e.g. art catalogues) 
additional pigments are used to overcome the cmyk (saturation)-limitations.

But instead of quarreling about this I simply wanted to say that the new 
RGB laser printers usually do a very good job with their automatic 
operation, at least for images without strong color bias.
I admit that I haven't bothered so far about what's going on inside the 
machine, they're very expensive, so I believe you that some complicated 
stuff is working inside.)

I also think it's out of question that the contrast range and color 
saturation of machine made prints cannot compare to those of 
transparencies or oil paintings. But the color resolution of those laser 
prints is fairly high so you can get a lot of information from the image 
onto the print also. I noticed this once in a negative sense, when I 
hoped that some faint splotches which were hardly visible on the screen 
would finally disappear on the print due to limited color space 
resolution - they didn't, and remained nicely visible.. :-(

ahmm, and yes, Rob, I meant of course pcond..

Greg and others,
 
I will validate Photosphere and thought about the following testing parameters:
 
matte saturated colored samples
matte Munsell gray cards
variation of f-stop from 2.8 to 8 (min and max on my digital camera)
incandescent vs. fluorescent vs. daylight (daylight is tough as it varies)
on-axis vs. 40 degrees off axis
colored and gray cards on black vs. white background
sample size around 4 X 4 cm^2 photographed at a distance of 5 meters or so
 
tested against spot luminance meter 1 degree
 
Any other suggestions?

Hi Rob,

you can use the classic mixfunc primitive for this, i.e. you mix your 
mapped image with a 'void' material.

void mixfunc transp_image
4 image void fore func.cal
0
n ..

'fore' gives the foreground coeffcient determined with help of a 
function in the cal file (if e.g you want the transparency to change 
over the surface..). Otherwise set 'fore' to a constant value and a '.' 
(point) for func.cal.

If you apply this mixed material to a trans base, make shure that the 
roughness parameter is zero to have the light really shine through it.

One follow-up on this. Among the reasons that we were so happy with the 
Lambdas and Pegasus (and I think also Ofoto, but I have much fewer data 
points) is that we can process the images as we would for viewing 
normally on our displays and then send them to print as is (with tif 
conversion) without further mucking about.

Message-ID: <5E215182-44AE-11D9-95BE-000A956A0F62@biomechanicsinc.com>

Hey folks - question about the "human" exposure response in rpict 
(ximage) versus pcond.  When I render an image (call it "output.hdr") 
and display it in ximage, I hit the "h" key and the image gets 
redisplayed with the "human" exposure mapping.  Then i take output.hdr 
and i put it through

  pcond -h output.hdr  >  output_cond.hdr

(now call the new conditioned file "output_cond.hdr") When i display 
"output_cond.hdr" in ximage, i get a different resulting image than 
when I viewed output.hdr in ximage and hit "h".  The ximage "h" version 
of output.hdr is darker and has more contrast than the output_cond.hdr 
image.  What's up with that?

thanks,

kirk

The 'mixfunc' primitive works if you can specify material using a 
function.  In Rob's case, he might prefer either the 'mixpict' or 
'mixtext' primitive.

You shouldn't be seeing these lines.  I expect the -dj .6 combined with 
-ds .1 are causing aiming failures that are resulting in these weird 
arguments.  I concur with Mark's suggestion, though the -DMC 
recompilation is a bit drastic.  You might simply try -ds .4 -dj .4 
first to see if that fixes it.

Hi Kirk,

Ximage using the 'h' command or the -e human option is more-or-less 
equivalent to pcond -c -s, but the -h option of pcond turns on acuity 
and veiling glare filters (-v and -a) that are not included in ximage.  
The veiling glare in particular can reduce the image contrast, 
especially around bright sources and objects.  Also, pcond using 
foveal-size (1 degree) luminance samples, rather than pixels, and this 
can result in a different tone curve.

Thanks Greg,

Unfortunately not getting any love using that, although I did accidentally
come across a slightly better result by applying the mirror material to
itself using the code below, not sure why!

void mirror lamp_bulb_outer_material
1 lamp_bulb_outer_material
0
3 0.9 0.9 0.9

The surface I'm trying to apply the material to is an imported mesh, could
that be a reason that adding the transparency to the mirror material isn't
working? The code I've tried is below if it helps:

void trans lamp_bulb_outer_transparency
0
0
7 .9 .9 .9 .01 .01 .5 .5
 

void mirror lamp_bulb_outer_material
1 lamp_bulb_outer_transparency
0
3 .9 .9 .9

lamp_bulb_outer_material mesh lamp_bulb_outer_object
1 lamp_bulb_outer.rtm
0
0

Thanks again,

Tom

He might, but he's a little lost on both Carsten's and Greg's 
suggestions.  This cal file/function stuff has always been a little

Hi Martin,

Don't expect good results, but this is definitely worthwhile.

You should combine this with the off-axis tests, since vignetting is 
known to increase at larger apertures.  You can actually plot the 
fall-off as a function of angle from the image center and fit a curve 
to it for each f-stop.  This can then be applied as a correction using 
pcomb.

You can use different color-balance fluorescents instead of relying on 
daylight.

The flare measurement we just performed on our camera is one I 
recommend.  Start with a uniform light source, such as a fluorescent 
fixture with a good diffuser.  Capture an HDR image of it, and take a 
luminance reading at its center.  Then, cover it with a black 
posterboard with a small hole cut in it and capture an image of the 
hole using exactly the same settings.  If the camera lens is perfect, 
the measurement of the hole should match the original uniform field.  
It will be lower, and the difference is due to scattering in the lens.

Hi Tom,

I'm not sure why using a mirror as its own alternate would do anything 
-- the code says it should be the same as not specifying an 
alternate....

That said, there's little point is specifying a mirror material for a 
mesh surface.  It should behave just like trans at that point -- it 
won't create any virtual sources, which is presumably why you would use 
'mirror' in the first place.  Virtual sources only get created for 
planar surface types:  'polygon' & 'ring'.  Any other surface type 
(including meshes) just get treated normally.

For a 90% reflective material with 10% transmission, the following 
'trans' should work:

void trans mirror_mat
0
0
7 .92 .92 .92 .9 0 1 1

By the way, if you have the hardware, generating a profile (icc) is not too
difficult, and you can re-use it as often as wanted...

Message-ID: <44BF41FE-4A27-11D9-A5F9-000A956A0F62@biomechanicsinc.com>

Users of LightWave and those in the know,

I have noticed that exporting an object from LightWave (.lwo) to 
WaveFront OBJ format yields a .obj file that does not specify the 
surface normals ("vn").  I can actually bring the .obj file into Poser 
and then re-export it as an .obj and, voila, the surface normals are 
included.  Anyone know what tweaks can be done or options can be 
exercised within  LightWave to export objects in .obj format with 
surface normals ("vn") listed in the file?  This is helpful when trying 
to use the obj2rad command and the -s option with obj2mesh for 
smoothing purposes.

Thanks!

kirk

Hi All,

I'm having some trouble understanging something (again).  I wanted to
verify that an .ies file I have is being used properly, and I'm getting
some confusing info.  I have an .ies-formatted photometry file for a
PAR38.  The candela at nadir is 5448.  To do a simple verification that
all is well I performed the following steps:

ies2rad -o foo -di -t white -m 1 foo.ies #convert file
oconv foo.rad > foo.oct # create octree
echo "0 0 -120 0 0 1" | rtrace -h -I -ab 0 foo.oct #calculate illuminance
at 10' below fixture

... output from that is:
3.276076e+00    3.276076e+00    3.276076e+00

Taking 3.276706 and multiplying by 179 I get 586 lux, or about 10x what
I'd expect.  I'd assumed that by measuring the light source in a void,
that the candela at nadir could be used in a simple point calc, unaffected
by interreflection.  So, shouldn't CBCP*d^2 = illuminance ?

What am I doing wrong here?

The d in d^w has to be meters, not feet.  That could account for the 
10x difference.

Gah, that would be an hour-long brain fart.  Of course that would

Rob,
 
When using IES files, do you think it's better to convert your lamp
color to white or use the real color values?  I always use the V-lambda
multiplier (something like... rcalc -e '$1=($1*.265+$2*.67+$3*.065)*179'
) and include the color when using ies2rad.  Seems like things get
complicated when you are running calculations and renderings and you
have different types of sources.  Maybe white is best?

Hi Mark,

I use white for lamp color, since the renderings tend to look funky 
when you use actual lamp colors.  RwR goes into this a bit, explaining 
it better than I could, but the general deal is that the eye is still 
better than any machine at dealing with visualizing scenes.  The eye 
does an amazing color-balance job, on the fly, that computer displays 
cannot, so color temperature differences tend to get exaggerated in 
renderings when you use explicit lamp colors.

On the other hand, I botched a point calc that didn't even involve 
cosine evaluation, so you may wanna think 2x (or 10.76x) before asking 
me *anything* about this stuff.  ;-)

Still embarrassed,
Rob Guglielmetti

Hi everybody,

I have some problems applying macbeth correction to some images. These 
are raw files converted to tiff with GraphicConverter, and then to pic, 
using ra_tiff. When I use macbethcal, it looks like it is working fine, 
no message, nevertheless if I view the debug.pic image, the right part 
of the squares stay black, which means that the calculation of the new 
color is not done. Here is the cal file I obtain where we can see that 
the variables are not calculated.

{
	Color correction file computed by:
		macbethcal -d A1.debug2.pic -p 1791 489 1724 2087 2839 539 2753 2134

	Usage: pcomb -f A1_2.cal uncorrected.pic > corrected.pic

rndx = rfi(1);
rn = ((rxa(rndx+1)-r)*rya(rndx) + (r-rxa(rndx))*rya(rndx+1)) /
		(rxa(rndx+1) - rxa(rndx)) ;

bndx = bfi(1);
bn = ((bxa(bndx+1)-b)*bya(bndx) + (b-bxa(bndx))*bya(bndx+1)) /
		(bxa(bndx+1) - bxa(bndx)) ;
r = ri(1); g = gi(1); b = bi(1);
ro = nan*rn + nan*gn + nan*bn ;
go = nan*rn + nan*gn + nan*bn ;
bo = nan*rn + nan*gn + nan*bn ;


I have no idea of what happens there. I tryed with an another file and 
had the same result. I also tryed with a blur. Is it because of the 
original raw format? or because I have no color profile? What should I 
do?

Hi Genevieve,

I don't know where you got these primary values, but CIE (x,y) 
primaries must each be between 0.0 and 1.0, and they cannot add up to 
greater than 1.0 when combined.  I suspect this is at least part of 
your problem.

	WORKSHOP
Message-ID: <10C94843061E094A98C02EB77CFC328710728DF9@nrcmrdex1d.imsb.nrc.ca>

What: The use of RADIANCE in Design Practice, Research, and Education 

Where: McGill University, School of Architecture, Montreal, Canada 
 
When: August 11th & 12th (Thursday & Friday) 2005
 
The workshop will be hosted by the National Research Council Canada (NRC)
and McGill University, School of Architecture. Workshop organizers are
Christoph Reinhart (NRC) and Greg Ward (Anyhere Software).
 
Estimated Cost: previous workshop registration fees were about 200-300
Canadian Dollar (~0.82 $US) and we will aim for a comparable figure. 
 
Purpose: To provide design practitioners, researchers, and educators with an
opportunity to present their work with the Radiance lighting simulation
software, and to share ideas and solutions with other attendees.
Participants are invited to give a talk, which will be limited to 30 minutes
(~20 minute for the talk followed by ~10 minutes of open discussion). Please
note that a presentation at the workshop does not count as an official
publication, so it can be submitted in parallel to other venues without
conflict, and likewise may be work that has been published elsewhere. We
also plan to organize a software demo session during which developers can
present their working software. It is yet to be determined whether this
workshop will also include a tutorial component. 
 
Radiance users of all levels are welcome.
 
This is a preliminary call to gauge the level of interest and determine if
we will be able to hold this workshop or not. So, if you are interested,
PLEASE RESPOND NO LATER THAN FRIDAY JANUARY 7 2005 to Greg
(gregoryjward@gmail.com <mailto:gregoryjward@gmail.com> ) and Christoph
(christoph.reinhart@nrc.ca <mailto:christoph.reinhart@nrc.ca> ).
 
Please note, that this workshop has been scheduled in the week preceding the
9th International Building Performance Simulation Association Conference
which will also be held in Montreal ( <http://www.ibpsa.ca/bs2005/>
http://www.ibpsa.ca/bs2005/). We hope that some of you will be able to
combine the conference with the Radiance workshop. A final announcement with
the agenda, workshop dates and registration fees will be sent out in late
Winter 2005. Please complete the form below if you would like to attend.

Subject: [Radiance-general] radout problem
Message-ID: <000501c4e744$a75ed960$0100a8c0@mallah>

Hi,
I am trying to export AutoCAD objects to Radiance, using radout.
Next problem occurs: some object from the file are exported and some not.For 
all layers (colors) rad files are created, but some of them don't contain 
any polygon description.
I tried to convert just that "problematic" objects, call radout, select 
object, and I've got next thing in the prompt:
1 found
1 was filtered out

Some of these objects are complex, but some are rather simple.
Can someone please tell me what might be the problem here, and how could I 
solve it?


Thanks for your time,
Marija

try to use 3ds instead:
3ds2mgf model.3ds 
mgf2rad model.mgf > model.rad

or

export 3ds from autocad 
import is again in autocad 
use torad
(this procedure just to mesh model elements)

to refine the mesh use (in autocad)
FACETRES = 10



hope it works,
cheers

Most likely, those objects are ACIS solid modelling entities (the
LIST command shows those as "3DSOLID" if I remember correctly).
This type of object is not supported by the free version of
Radout. The best and simplest way to convert them is by using
Rayfront. There are also some workarounds available for
transforming them into "normal" entities first, which may or may
not be practical for you.

Incidentally,

I came across a problem with TORAD export recently - if anyone has had
problems trying to export with LAYER names  - you need to edit the torad.lsp
file and replace 'setsamplemode' with 'setradsamplemode'.

Leaving the prefix box blank, the rad files will be exported in the current
directory with the layer names.

Thank you for your suggestions.
I solved problem in few steps:
1.import AutoCAD file in 3DStudio Max
2.Export file from 3DStudio to AutoCAD format
3.open file in Auto CAD

Of course, all polygons were triangulated, but conversion to radiance format 
was successful.

Thank you again,

Marija.
