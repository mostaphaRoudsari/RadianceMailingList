Obviously, I should have given this a little more thought.  I just
copied the function you had straight into the formula, without
doing anything to keep it in a legal range.  The following is better,
but since I don't know what you're trying to do with this formula,
you should probably think about fixing the range or the formula
yourself.

void brightfunc trans_mod
2 bound(0,1-.6667/Rdot,1) .
0
0

trans_mod trans surf_dens
0
0
7 1 1 1 0 0 1 1

Sorry.

Obviously, *I* should have given this more thought. What I
wanted wasn't represented by the formula that I originally
wrote. I mistook the Rdot for 1/Rdot, and I didn't realize
that I needed to flip the normal if I was looking at the
back of the object.

Anyways, I present, then, a Radiance method for rendering
an x-ray of an object:

------
# include some background light source
void light bc
0 0 3  1 1 1
bc source back
0 0 4  0 1 0  180

# then, the surface modifiers for every "x-rayed" object
void brightfunc trans_mod
2 0.6+0.35*abs(Rdot) .
0
0

trans_mod trans mc
0
0
7 1 1 1 0 0 1 1
------

And the results:

Identifiers appear to be limited to 128 bytes (common/object.h
defines MAXSTR with that value, which is used by getobject() in
common/readobj.c). Maybe there's another limitation somewhere
else in the code, but I don't really expect so.

The other relevant factoid is that almost all non-whitespace
characters are legal in identifiers. Just avoid 'single' and
"double" quotes. Those are reserved because 3.6b needs them
around file paths that contain whitespace characters (eg. to
reference function files, particularly on Windows).

Message-ID: <s01e7614.010@wmtao.com>

** Proprietary **

Thank you for the responses.  I see your point!  I'm having a hard
enough time figuring out what part of the images I want to focus on
myself!  Getting the computer to auto expose would probably be pretty
tough when you have both interior and exterior in an image.  What is the
histogram showing?

Well I went through and manually computed my exposure values using
rview and then interpolated the frames in between.  This was kind of
tedious but it was enough to determine what I am calling "good" exposure
values.  Now, it seems that RAD uses the exposure value to determine the
ambient value of the image, while RANIMATE uses the exposure value and
simply passes it on to pfilt.  Only rad will only accept one exposure
value and the exposure file goes in ranimate...  which does not seem
right considering all the frames are getting av .5 .5 .5 rather than a
value appropriate to the frame's daylight condition.

Thanks

Implementing displacement maps in Radiance would be extremely 
difficult, I believe.  You have to change from a geometric intersection 
technique to a "proximity" intersection technique for displaced 
surfaces.  I have no idea what form this code would take, or how it 
would work.  It seems to me that it would require major overhauls of 
both the octree generator and the ray tracing engine.  I don't have 
time for it, nor have I the need for such a facility.  Radiance is 
designed for architectural models, and the more exotic renderings are 
better left to Maya and Renderman, in my opinion.

Hi Greg,

I did not think that using the typical displacement map is the best 
solution. My idea was taking a geometry as a surface modifier. The 
basic functionality is provided by todays radiance: instances and the 
replmarks program are doing almost what I want. If I don't replace 
every triangle (like replmarks does) with an instance, but every face 
of a geometry, using the uv-values to place and rotate the instance, 
then cutting this instance at the boundaries of the face, I have a 
3d-texture... or am I totally wrong here?

CU Lars.

Aside from the slight overlap or underlap at the edges depending on 
surface curvature, your idea is basically sound.  However, implementing 
this idea efficiently in Radiance would be a big challenge.  If we were 
to minimize code changes, we'd be using instances of some kind with 
clipping, and we'd end up with a lot of overlapping suboctrees.  Many 
on this list can tell you their headaches surrounding those if you 
haven't had enough of your own.  Getting tighter bounds on the 
instanced geometry would require some rather fundamental changes to the 
handling of octrees, and still wouldn't completely remedy the problems 
with side-by-side instances.  They just don't work that well.

Geometry as a modifier also would entail rewriting the octree 
generator, which currently ignores all surface modifiers.  I'm not sure 
how much work this would be, but I would say "more than a little."  
Unless there is some general need for this kind of rendering in 
Radiance or someone with money and/or time to spend on it, I don't see 
it happening.

Hi Jochen,

This is a new one on me, I have to admit.  Thanks for sharing this.  I 
managed to find a website for this product 
(http://www.thefarleyceiling.com/default.asp), but it is a bit thin on 
info.  From what I can tell, this is just a fabric panel.  Is this 
correct, or is part of the system the skylight well above the panel? 
Either way, judging from the photos on the website, is seems like a 
simple job for plastic & trans (and illum sources!), to model this in 
Radiance.

Can you share more info about this ceiling system?

Hi,

ok, the overlapping... I think I understood the problem ;-) And yes, it 
is not really a typical application for radiance. I had been hoping 
that this would be an easy modification because of the instance 
primitive, but obviously I was wrong.

CU Lars.

Subject: [Radiance-general] A question about Animations, and about the Book that will solve all
 my troubles...
In-Reply-To: <BAY2-F91eMvzBHSXVIr000348ad@hotmail.com>

Hello all,

    I've been learning Radiance over the last year or so, primarily 
running it within Cygwin, rendering models exported from Revit or 
generated by hand.

    Now that I've gotten to where I can produce OK renderings (need to 
learn more complex materials), I would like to try making a simple 
animation to learn how. From reading the wonderful post I found in the 
archive from Greg Ward about making animation paths, I'm almost there, 
however I'm missing something and getting an error because of it.

    I've generated the key.vf file with multiple viewpoints set for my 
animation path, along with a -t following each one for the amount of 
time I want between each point along the path. I've generated the 
key.fmt file. However, when I run the command to extract the information 
from my key.vf into a form that can be manipulated to make the full 
path, all I get in the key.cal file is:

Px(x):select(1,);
Py(x):select(1,);
Pz(x):select(1,);
Dx(x):select(1,);
Dy(x):select(1,);
Dz(x):select(1,);
H(x):select(1,);
V(x):select(1,);
T(x):select(1,);

Now, it seems like this is wrong, for when I try the next step, which is 
to then use this key.cal along with spline.cal to generate my desired 
animation path, it exits with an 'unexpected character' as soon as it 
reaches that blank value after the '1,' it even points at the space in 
the error. And then my desired path file is created, but blank.

So I'm at a loss, as I've tried this several times, and I know I'm 
typing everything verbatim from the example in the post. Is this 
something that's a problem because of Cygwin? Some grammar thing? I 
haven't had a chance to test it on Linux yet.

So if anyone can point me in the right direction, I'd be terribly 
appreciative. Also, I'd love to know if the 'Rendering with Radiance' 
book is going to be out/available anytime soon, for then it would 
greatly lessen my nagging questions to all of you. :-)

Thanks in advance,

Jeffrey McGrew

Hi Jeffrey,

In fact, it's not a Cygwin problem.  It's due to something missing in 
the key.fmt file.  I forgot to add the new -vo and -va view parameters 
to the list, so the format string didn't match any of the views 
produced by rview.  Here is the corrected version, which works:

rview -vtv -vp ${px} ${py} ${pz} -vd ${dx} ${dy} ${dz} -vu 0 0 1 -vh 
${vh} -vv ${vv} -vo 0 -va 0 -vs 0 -vl 0 -t ${t}

I should have checked it before reposting the message -- I had the 
chance to correct my mistake, before!

Sorry,
-Greg

Radiance-Users (UK) Course 2004: Notice for Expressions of Interest 

Following on from the success of the 2003 course, the IESD are
planning to host another in 2004 (around September). Intended 
for researchers and practitioners, it will be led by Dr. John 
Mardaljevic (author of the Daylight Simulation chapter of the 
Radiance book) and take place in the Queens Building, De Montfort 
University, Leicester, UK. The course will focus on how Radiance 
is used to solve real-world lighting problems. There will be an 
emphasis on daylight modelling and controlling the ambient calculation.

Course viability will depend on sufficient numbers. To register 
an interest in attending, send e-mail to John Mardaljevic. 
Please give name, affiliation and contact details for each person.

Regards,

-John Mardaljevic

Hello. I would like to provide the link of my dissertation to the 
Radiance group. The dissertation is titled "Transformations in 
Architectural Lighting Analysis: Virtual Lighting Laboratory". I had 
presented very early stages of the research during the 1. Radiance 
workshop and some of you have asked about its progress during the 2. 
Radiance workshop. The link is:   
http://www-personal.umich.edu/~inanici/vll/vll.html 
<http://www-personal.umich.edu/%7Einanici/vll/vll.html>

This dissertation presents a framework for a computer generated luminous 
environment that supports the knowledge acquisition between the theory 
and the practice of architectural lighting. Per-pixel lighting 
information is extracted from the high dynamic range images (Radiance 
images) through virtual meters and photometry systems. Formation and 
utilization of these virtual meters (luminance meter, illuminance meter, 
contrast meter, integrating sphere, colorimeter, and scotopic meter) are 
demonstrated. The total, regional, and per-pixel lighting data are 
processed to study the quantity, distribution, directionality, and 
spectral content of lighting.

I would like to thank everybody in the Radiance online group, not only 
for answering my questions, but for contributing to the rich information 
in the archives. I did not even have to ask many of the questions 
because the answers were readily available. Special thanks to Greg: I 
have referred to many of his articles and of course, I have generated 
all of the images with Radiance.

Please let me know if you have questions or comments.
Thank you,
Mehlika Inanici

Hi!

No, I won't announce anything useable here ;-) But at least, something 
which proofs that it is possible to import and store Radiance scenes in 
XML.

RadianceML is a project I just started to define a DTD for Radiance 
scenes in XML, together with XSL-translators to import and export data. 
At the moment, I have a very simple DTD describing... hmmm.. let's say 
a subset of the Radiance scene language (actually only comments, 
spheres and polygons are understood ;-) and a XSL-template that imports 
.rad-files (containing only this "subset") into RadianceML-XML.

What has to be done until 1.0:

- complete Radiance scene language in DTD and import-template

- "xmlizer", small tool tagging Radiance scenes (XSL can process
   only XML, so I have to tag the radiance scene files before
   importing them)

- export-template from RadianceML to rad

Later, this will / can be extended to export to e.g. x3d, think about 
documented scenes (docbook), ...

So, whoever is interested in this project, send me a mail asking for 
the current "distribution". It is not GPLed at the moment, and I won't 
grant you the right to redistribute it now, because I want to get an 
idea if there is interest in this. If you have any comment about the 
project, or questions, or proposals, or if you want to participate, 
just send me (private, not list-) mail.

CU, Lars.

Hi there,

just new on the list, and I'm immediatelly going to ask a question :

I'm currently working on a project concerning visual-lighting problems in 
office-buildings, more specifically problems concerning blinding and glare, 
so in short, visual comfort.

Now, for the glazing I'm using Optics5 to calculate the transmittance of the 
used glazing-system.  When I get the grafs and data (spectral), I export 
this data to Radiance, via the "export to radiance" option in Optics5 
itself.  I then get the  R, G & B values in radiance.  Now, my question, 
Optics5 provides transmittances and reflectances, so after exporting the 
data to radiance do these values remain transmittances?  The R, G & B 
values, are they transmittances? So for, I haven't found any reason to 
believe that the "export" function converts them to transmissivities, but I 
want te be sure that the convertor doesn't comprise the trans.cal convertion 
too.

I 've got another question that is linked to the previous one.  When you get 
the converted data from Optics5 in Radiance, can I directly use them as 
glazing-data-input in the material file for the glazing or not?  At the 
moment, I'm still thinking that the R G B 's are transmittances, so if I use 
them directly without converting them to transmissivities, am I going to get 
  realistic result?  After all, Radiance uses transmissivity for the 
calculation, so I'm risking to get a double-correction on my results.

If anyone can clear this out for me, I'd be very grateful.

Hi Birger,

In the Optics5 output to Radiance the values in the glass material are
transmissivities and not transmittances.

If you take a look at the following file (made with Optics) you will see
that the glass is has a transmittance (tau) of 0.840 (in the comment) and
the definition of glass has 0.930 0.916 0.847 as R G B values. If these were
transmittances it should have been (photopic average):

0.265*tauR + 0.670*tauG + 0.065*tauB = 
0.265*0.930 + 0.670*0.916 + 0.065*0.847 = 0.840 (wrong!)

but it is instead:
0.265*0.930 + 0.670*0.916 + 0.065*0.847 = 0.915 (indeed the transmissivity,
check with the formula).

So I suppose it is exporting correctly. And you can use it directly into
Radiance without converting the values.
Hope it is clear.

Regards,
Annalisa.

Subject: [Radiance-general] difference between ascii and binary output
Message-ID: <40360AE0.9090705@bradford.ac.uk>

Hi there,

before I despair I ask the RADIANCE-world (maybe there is a difference 
even if there shouldn't be one):

When writing out data with 'pvalue' you can write ascii or binary files.
I chose 'pvalue -o -h -df ' for a binary file
and 'pvalue -o -h ' for an ascii file.

I then read both files into Matlab (under MS Windows): The ascii files 
are fine, they show the exact same values as when viewing the 
corresponding pic-image with ximage, or when just looking at the 
ascii-file itself. (The world is consistent! Great!)

Then I read the binary file in (I have taken into account that the files 
were generated on a big-endian machine and are now read on a 
little-endian machine).
And: The numbers that you yield look reasonable, similar to what you 
would expect, BUT  they are not the same, even though the binary and the 
ascii file were generated from the very same pic-file.

I looked at the minimum and the maximum values of either file, I 
computed the sum over all pixel values: they are just not the same! 
(just in case the matrix I deal with is in a different orientation)

WHY???? Please help!

Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Alexa

P.S. yes, I could use ascii-files, but they are huge and it takes longer 
to read them in. So, that's why I want to store them as binaries.

Hi Alexa,

The latest version of pvalue (from the HEAD distribution) includes a 
-dF option to output byte-swapped floating point problems.  If your 
source and destination machines have different byte orderings (little 
endian vs. big endian), then this might solve your problem.  You also 
should apply the -H option (in addition to the -h option) to avoid 
output of the image resolution string, which will likely mess up the 
reading of the data.

First information for Pov-Ray users:

    You made it through the mirror!

Radiance is based on a right-handed coordinate system.

For elevations this means:

X points right
Y points into the screen and
Z points up

For plan views:

X points right
Y points up
Z points out of the screen


About the view vector:

You define views basically by giving the position of the
observer (viewpoint, -vp) in world coordinates and the
direction (not the point!) of his view (view direction, -vd).
For views, there is only the global coordinate system, so
the direction is given in dx, dy and dz of the global system.

If we picture a scene with a room centered at (0,0) and an
observer looking from east (10,0) into the room, his view
vector is (-1,0). Another observer at (10,-3) has a vector
of (-1,0.3). The view vector will be unified internally but
to define it in "rview"/"rvu" you can enter any value you like.

No PhD needed to use it!

I'm a bit out of touch and can't point you to URLs but
the Radiance home page and www.radiance-online.org will
have sections about documentation.
Search for the introduction of Ward/Shakespears book
"Rendering with Radiance". The intro chapter is/was
available as pdf and contains a simple tutorial. You may
have to replace every occurence of "rview" with "rvu" 
since the application was renamed recently. It depends
on where and when you got your Radiance distribution.

The view vector is just the difference between the point of 
interest and the position of your camera. If you want to look at 
the point (0,0,0) with the camera at (-1,2,-5)  the view vector 
is (1,-2,5). Don't forget the up-vecor, (0,1,0) or (0,0,1) should 
be fine for the most cases (according to the orientation of your
scene, Radiance uses rather (0,0,1) (gensky creates a z-upward 
oriented sky), but if are more familiar with 3d-programs with y 
for up, it might be easier to build scenes that way with (0,1,0).

Hi Anthony,

To simulate the perfomance of things like light pipes, you need to use a 
tool with forward raytracing capabilities, radiance in its classic form 
is a backward raytracer:

    * forward raytracing - trace rays from sources in scene to eyepoint
    * backward raytracing  - trace rays from eyepoint back into scene

One way to do forward raytracing is "photon mapping." Roland Schregle 
has written an extension to radiance that performs photon mapping:

Since this is an extension to the core radiance engine, this will 
require moving beyond Desktop Radiance.

Note there are two prism material types in Radiance: prism1 and prism2. 
These would probably be useful for defining the properties of the 
prismatic glazing, the trick is acquiring perfomance data for the 
physical material(s) and correctly modeling the behavior with these 
radiance material types. I have not really used these material types 
before. However there should be others in the group who can provide 
feedback to you.

It is also possble the depending on how you breakdown your problem that 
there are simpler ways to do what you want. For example what are the key 
issues of what you are trying to simulate and evaluate:

    * properties of light pipe performance - then this probably requires
      the use of photon mapping
    * properties of prismatic glazing as enhancers of light distribution
      - can this be seperated out from the light pipe and evaluated
      using more classic techniques in standard radiance, in other words
      can you make some estimates for light output from the side
      apertures of the light pipe and thus remove the actual simulation
      of the light pipe behavior?

I expect you wil get other input, which I will look forward to reading 
myself.

Hi Anthony,<br>

To simulate the perfomance of things like light pipes, you need to use

One way to do forward raytracing is "photon mapping." Roland Schregle

  <pre wrap="">Hi folks,

I wish to analyse the light distribution to an office room supplied from a
light pipe fitted with side apertures.

The apertures will contain prismatic glazing or a blind reflector.

I have drawn the light pipe using desktop radiance, and made the surface 97%
spec ref. as from typical light pipe manufacturers data.

I wish to include prismatic glazing or other novel glazing types such as
blind reflectors to enhance the light distribution from the side aperture.

Can anyone give me some insight as to how I may do this, since the glazing
database that comes with desktop radiance only contains common glass types,
and not prismatic or such like - perhaps one of you know of a patch for
desktop radiance that provides several different prismatic glazing types, or
of code for Radiance that includes for it.

Hi Ling,

The smoothing functions of tmesh2rad and gensurf should work adequately 
with all material types, including trans and trans2.  Prior to the 3.5 
official release, there was a bug in the code that caused the surfaces 
to look wrong when viewed from the backside, but this was fixed about a 
year ago.  If you are using Desktop Radiance or an older release of the 
software, this could be your problem.

Dear Sir,
 
I was wondering how you would create a translucent smooth surface that 
will respond well to the triangle smoothing of TMesh2Rad.
 
I have tried Trans, Trans2 without success, and have found very little 
documentation on transfunc, which I believe is the correct way to 
approach this problem.
 
Thank you for your time,
Yours truly,
Ling Xiao

 analysis
Message-ID: <s03c75b4.097@arup.com.au>

Hi Anthony, Jack,

What Jack says about simulating light pipes is right.  simulating these with radiance in general will not work.  i haven't tried the photon map, but sounds like it should work for you there.

regards modelling prismatics or similar materials, there are a couple of cal-files that can help.  prism.cal is part of the standard radiance distribution, and allows the modelling of prismatic glazing, using the prism2 material primitive.  lcp0.cal is another (not part of the standard distribution but i can supply it) that models laser cut light redirecting panels (LCPs).  this also is for use with the prism2 material primitive.

the use of each of these cal files is not simple.  it requires manual editing of scene files, careful orientation of geometry and material definitions and knowledge of the form of the prismatic or laser cut panel being modelled.

let us know if you would like the LCP cal file, or more help creating prism2 definitions.
Phil.

Subject: [Radiance-general] radiance-online will be down for server upgrade
Message-ID: <403DC022.9010304@pab-opto.de>

Hi all,

The radiance-online server will be down from tonight, 26.2.04, 17:00 
UTC, for some major software updates. It should be up and running as 
usual on Monday, 1.3.04 . This effects all operations on the machine:

   1. Incoming mails are queued, but you may get some notifications from
      the failback mail handling system at FhG-ISE saying it can't reach
      radiance-online.
   2. web and CVS access is down

Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause, adding future features to 
the site will be greatly eased by this long awaited reconfiguration of 
the core.

regards
Peter Apian-Bennewitz

Hi folks,

after spending the weekend at my office and getting a new Linux software 
and configuration, radiance-online.org is back in the rack and on-line.

If you feel no differences - good.  The reason for this major 
reconfiguration beneath the visible skin was to cast new foundations 
that will allow features to be implemented in the future.

However, there a some subtle changes in the mail processing system, 
which might be worth mentioning:

   1. our new mail transport system (MTA, mail transport agent, Exim4)
      is more aware of MIME attachments in emails. Mails not conforming
      to the MIME specs or containing file attachments ending with "bat
      com exe pif prf scr vbs doc" will be rejected. Obviously, this
      tries not to relay emails originating from a subscribed, but
      infected email address. It is not intended to be 100% foolproof
      (or 100% MS-proof which is the same regarding their email
      handling), so everyone is still urged to watch out for viruses on
      her/his machine and protect it in general.
      The usual disclaimer still applies: I can't take any
      responsibility for malicious things posted on the list. The
      measures just ensure a reasonable step beyond what we had before.
   2. The mailing list and archive system (Mailman) now handles MIME
      attachments. They used to clobber the archived mail, now they are
      moved cleanly to separate files.
   3. Presumably all per-user-settings have been brought forward from
      mailman 2.0.11 to the new version 2.1.4 .

In case of questions or problems, please don't hesitate to contact me.

Many thanks to the developers of  the public domain software Mailman, 
Apache, Exim and the maintainers of the Linux Debian distribution,

cheers
Peter Apian-Bennewitz
