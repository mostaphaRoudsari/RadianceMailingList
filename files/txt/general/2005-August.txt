Hi Huang.

Sorry for the late reply, I hope you did not despaire yet.

You can find a few of the mapping types illustrated here:

http://home.arcor.de/tbleicher/radiance/imagemaps.html#mapping_types

I wrote this two years ago and can't remember where I got my
information from in the first place; probably try-and-error.

Hi Thomas,

this is an interesting amount of work you've put up on your website, for 
unknown reasons I haven't heard of all this before..

I just started looking at Blender some days ago, and I am currently a 
bit overwhelmed by it, too. So it's the Blender part of the matter which 
still
delays any further occupation with it on my side, btw the same holds 
true for Francesco's work. But there will come the time when I catch up 
with both of you on this. It would be definitely interesting to connect 
all our activites in some way...

Message-ID: <59D2F6BF-C9AB-43C8-B708-A23D400ED440@gmail.com>

Hello All,

I was expecting to hear back about compile problems from a number of  
people by this point, but so far the airwaves have been silent.   
Either 3.7 is compiling flawlessly in a lot of unexpected places, or  
everyone's too busy enjoying their summers to have given it a try.

Nevertheless, I found one rather serious bug in the new Russian  
roulette sampling code, urging me to post a patch release, which is  
now available from:

     http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/download.html

I have also recompiled everything under Linux, FreeBSD, and Mac OS  
X.  These files have not been posted as yet on radiance-online, as  
Peter A-B is off on vacation for the week.  I expect he'll get around  
to it before too long, and meanwhile the HEAD dump will be very close  
to 3.7.1 (if not identical).

I hope to see some of you at the Radiance workshop next week.

Message-ID: <20050805224405.69755.qmail@web41124.mail.yahoo.com>

Hello,

I am new to Radiance.  I just installed the latest
version (rad3R7all) on Mac OSX.4 and it is working
fine (as long as I start X11 first) with rad, rview,
etc.  I have downloaded and installed
TclTkAquaBI-8.4.10.0.  I try to run trad from the
xterm, and I get the following message:

$ trad
trad: line 12: syntax error at line 16: `(' unexpected

Thanks for any help you might be able to offer.  I
haven't actually run any tcl programs on the mac
before, so perhaps there is something I need to know
about that.  I tried installing the tcl launcher and
then running trad from the finder, but it didn't work
either.

Thanks again,

Hi.

As far as I can tell, they seem to have changed Tcl/Tk in some  
fundamental ways, and the old trad code no longer runs properly.  I  
don't have time right now to investigate, unfortunately.  I don't  
have the latest documentation on Tcl, and it's been forever since I  
touched any of this code.

Anyone else have info. on the evolution of Tcl/Tk?  I wish they  
didn't keep changing it in incompatible ways.  Every new release  
seems to break something, and it's been many releases since I made  
any updates.

Hi,

one hint, the tile-functions are explained (on the really nice webpage,
maybe the most comprehensive page to learn about mapping with radiance) to
give always a square picture. AFAIK that's why one should give the aspect
ratio of the picture on the third line, e.g.

void colorpict mymap
7 red green blue myimage.pic picture.cal tile_u tile_v
0
1 2.5

Hope I'm not wrong, I am currently sitting in an internet cafe in Istanbul
without access to my radiance installation ;-)

Have a nice workshop next week!

Hello All,

I have compiled and installed the Radiance 3.7 (downloaded August 2,
2005) under Knoppix 3.9 and everything compiled and played nicely Greg.

One small backwater that has missed the general name change is the obj
directory. There are many references to the old 'rview' program which
need changing to 'rvu' in the next release as this directory is a good
source of information to new users.

Thanks for that. I didn't try it yet but I'll have to
research this mapping stuff sooner or later in detail
to give a more complete coverage in the page.

Right now I'm having fun with other things, though.

Hi all,

some news for the more adventurous folks: there's a new QT based gui
version of radzilla available now, see the download section of the
radzilla page. To avoid misunderstandings, it doesn't provide any CAD
input or the like, (there are other projects aiming at this already) but
focuses on making octree generation, scene preview/rendering, parameter 
setting
etc. more convenient. The stuff is still in an alpha state and not
complete, nevertheless I think time has come to publish it for the first
testing . There's also an additional manual for it,  providing at least
the basic overview to get you started.

As I combine the trip to Canada for the workshop with some holiday, I
will be out of reach for the upcoming weeks, leaving you pretty much alone
with this stuff, so be prepared to wait a bit longer for answers from me :-)

Good luck & have fun

Message-ID: <20050811053534.GA23493@www.radiance-online.org>

Hi folks,

Webpages at radiance-online are updated to rad3R7P1 .

For a change, the full tar file (including aux libs, TIFF libs and all) is now
called rad3R7P1all.tar.gz (8.6MB).

rad3R7P1.tar.gz (1.5MB) needs the "auxiliary files" rad3R7P1supp.tar.gz.

rad3R7P1 and the HEAD release had been identical as of 9. Aug 2005. As before,
patches are generated nightly between the last official (rad3R7P1) and the 
current HEAD release. 

As an extra, Greg has thrown in binaries for MacOs and Linux. The latter
were compiled here, which is a "Debian, i386, Sarge" Linux distribution. I'd
expect the binaries to run on other, reasonable current, Linux dists as well.

so much for house keeping, 
happy rendering

Actually I've been digging only semi-succesfully in the archives to find a

this primitive? Any experiences writing converters to mesh primitives are

4 times in the U and V, if I want for it to tile 1,2,3,6,8,etc. times and I 
wish to shift the patern by 1/2, is there a method for doing this?

hope this helps:

es.

shift by 50% and tile 10 times:


(X(Lu+0.5)/(1/10))-floor(X(Lu+0.5)/(1/10))

or
X(Lu+0.5)/.1-floor(X(Lu+0.5)/.1)

where X is the ratio X/Y of the image to map.

you may use directly these expression in colormap:

void colormap test
7 red green blue picture.pic 
. 
(X(Lu+0.5)/.1-floor(X(Lu+0.5)/.1))  
((Lv+0.5)/.1-floor((Lv+0.5)/.1))
0
0


the "." means no cal file

ciao

giulio


PS remember that you need to recreate the mesh for this to take
effect...

Hi Jelle,

The Radiance mesh file is a compiled format.  The easiest way to it  
is via Wavefront/Alias .OBJ format.  If you really want to write your  
own custom exporter directly to .rtm, you'll have to adapt what lives  
in the src/ot directory.  I wrote the routines to be general, but I  
don't have guide to offer in their use.

Hey Carsten,

Well, I downloaded the source, recompiled, and here's the error I got 
this time:

rumblestrip:~/Desktop/office rpg$ rzvu -x 500 -y 500 test.zoct
*** malloc: vm_allocate(size=3221225472) failed (error code=3)
*** malloc[24926]: error: Can't allocate region

So I think we still have a problem with rzvu here.  But no matter, for 
you are on vacation.  Have fun, and watch out for the bears, snakes and 
mountain lions.  =8-)

Out of interest I did a small search in Apples support section and
found how to do it on a OS X server:

==================================================================
This article describes how to change the default application for
opening a particular a file.


The default application is the one which opens when you open a file.

Mac OS X Server matches applications with files they can open
automatically. You can't influence the available default applications
for files in any way other than by installing or removing applications.

To change a file's default application, follow these steps:

      1. In the Workspace Manager, select the file by clicking on it.
      2. Open the Tools menu and choose Inspector.
      3. Choose Tools from the Inspector pop-up menu.
      4. Select an application's icon from the center of the window.
      5. Click Set Default.
==================================================================

Don't know if this is any help on a workstation.



> I trashed ~Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices.plist
            ^ looks like this is in your HOME directory

If you only deleted your private copy Preview will use system defaults.
You need to change those but as far as I can tell Apple does not want
anybody to mess with the *.plist file(s). They look like some kind of
mime-type definition to me and would be the right place to do it.

> BTW - Preview now opens hdr and exr files - which may be part of
> the problem

"Opens hdr and exr" ... successfully? If so, *.plist definitions have
been replaced (I saw in an article that this would happen during the
update) and OS X simply does not know any more that there is another
application for these file types.

If it doesn't work, I think the *.hdr extension gets missinterpreted
as HDRI TIFF files and the default for TIFFs (Preview) is started.
I don't know *.exr; some species of JPEG?


OT: I was going to buy an iMac in the near future. But this short
    trip into Apple user information did put me off a bit. Everthing
    that looked halfway technical wasn't even mentioned on any of
    the pages. But that's exactly the kind of information I'm looking
    for when I have to consult manuals.

    I know there are a few MaxOS X user out there. How are your
    experiences with Radiance etc. on OS X? Do the Unix apps work
    in a one-mouse-button environment?


Any feedback is welcome,

Thomas

Hi Rob,

Did you try doing a "Get Info" from the Finder on a .pic file and  
telling it to set the default application for all files of this type  
to Photosphere?  That's what I would try.  It's better to use  
the .hdr suffix, because Macintosh PICT files sometimes use .pic  
rather than .pict as their suffix, and this confuses OS X no end.  In  
particular, Tiger is always running it's mdimport application on .pic  
files, which takes forever to figure out that it's not actually a  
PICT file at all but a Radiance picture.  The details of why this is  
are hard to explain and I'm not sure I understand them myself, so  
it's just better to use .hdr for Radiance pictures on the Mac.  I  
should probably change rad to use this suffix by default, but it's  
hard to change a convention like that without breaking a lot of  
things other people have built on it.

-Greg

P.S.  Regarding Thomas' comments *.exr is the OpenEXR format, and  
*.hdr is usually interpreted as Radiance format under OS X.  The  
latest mouse from Apple is 3-button, and there is generally good  
support for third-party three-button mice.  The one-button mouse  
works using the control- and option- keys, but it's a pain that way.   
There is a good set of OS X books available from O'Reilly, which may  
even be found as free PDFs online.  My favorite is "Mac OS X for Unix  
Geeks," which I found on the web somewhere.  I have the hardcopy as  
well, but I can't seem to locate the link at the moment -- maybe it  
was a fluke.

Duh.  You said you tried it and it didn't work, and I just tried it  
myself just now and it didn't work on my Mac, either.  I guess they  
must have built the .pic recognizer in at some low level that can't  
be overridden.  A mistake on their part, I would say.  Once again,  
trying to protect the user from him/herself.

Sorry for the sloppy response -- trying to cram too many e-mails into

I have O'Reilly's "Using SAMBA" as a pdf, can't remember where I got 
that either, but felt like I was getting away with something when I 
downloaded it.  I think it's a fluke, Greg. "Mac OS X for Unix  Geeks" 
is a good book, as are most of the O'Reilly catalog items.

Greg, Chas

Thanks for the help. I have moved this discussion to the general section as 
requested.

The white card method that Chas proposed was my "Plan B" if no white 
surfaces were available. I'll have to try the method that Greg suggested. 
The error message, "exposure out of range", that I receive is from pfilt.

Regarding the code modification, I am unsure if this method will work the 
way that I wish. If I am using a color, I could vary its hue with colorfunc 
but if I am using in image map with colorpict (wood floors are generally the 
most offending material with regard to color bleeding), I do not think that 
I can vary the color in accordance with a color bleeding parameter.

Thanks for all of everyone's help (including the email from cb)

Message-ID: <004B883B-B2D4-44D6-B4BF-0BAB0FAF7F92@gmail.com>

Well, another significant bug was discovered in the interreflection  
calculation of the new release, prompting me to create a new patch  
distribution, version 3.7.2.  This may be found in the usual place at:

     http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/download.html

I have also recompiled everything under Linux, FreeBSD, and Mac OS X,  
so the posted binaries contain the fix.  The problem manifests in  
certain complex environments, causing severe underestimation on rare  
occasions, and didn't show up in my initial tests.  It took me a  
couple of hours to track down the problem, and I spent a few more  
making sure I'd really fixed it.

Thanks is due to Mark Stock for creating the killer test scene and  
pointing out the error to me on the radiance-dev list over the  
weekend.  Mark has been busy creating a new benchmark for Radiance,  
and will no doubt make an announcement to radiance-general when he  
feels it is ready for prime time.  This of course requires that the  
new version of Radiance be ready for prime time as well...

I appreciate your patience in working out these difficulties.  There  
were a great many changes in the latest release, and I'm not  
surprised to find one or two glitches.  I hope this is the last of  
the serious ones requiring a patch release.  I expect Peter A-B will  
update radiance-online shortly.

not find anything specific I might have to do when compiling or installing
Radiance to take advantage of the 64 bit processing. What is the best

You just saw my posting after we had talked -- there should be no

There is a typo on the downloads page, though ("loking" rather than  
"looking").

Subject: [Radiance-general] Area lights breaking up?
Message-ID: <20050824052916.12d3dd93@saavik.ian.testers.net.au>

Hi,
	I'm having trouble with a scene I'm rendering. I have billiard balls that
are a "plastic" material and a large area light above them. For some reason
the area light appears in their reflections as a grid of squares (or
circles now that I've changed the roughness). The shadows even show this
break-up of the area light.

Here's a small sample:
http://www.ian.testers.homelinux.net/dump/billiard_main4.weird
(hosted on my ADSL line, be nice!)

I've tried fiddling with -dj and -ds, and a few other rpict parameters, but
they don't seem to do much at all. Is this a bug in Radiance 3.7 or am I
doing something wrong? I've never had this problem with area lights in
Radiance before.

thanks,
bye

Are you sure?  I'm pretty sure that effect you see is the result of the 
-ds parameter subdividing your largeish area source into smaller bits.  
Fiddling with -ds should have changed the number of sources you saw in 
your reflections.  Setting -ds to 0 turns this off, which you may want 
to try.

The problem appears to be with the roughness of the plastic. If it's set
to 0, then reflections are shown. As soon as I increase it to as much 0.01,
the plastic is no longer reflective and all we see is the specular
highlights of the sub-divided area light pieces. Is this the intended
behaviour? I remember spending quite some time fine-tuning these parameters
to look just the way I wanted. Now nothing I can do will bring back the old
appearance. The billiard balls should be glossy but not too smooth.

I wondered if my problems might be to the mixfuncs and such that I use to
produce the billiard balls. So I made a super simple scene to test this
problem and I get the same results. I've attached it to this email. Just
run rad on the test.rif file.

Here is what I get:
http://www.ian.testers.homelinux.net/dump/test_main

The left ball has a roughness of 0.01, the one on the right is 0.

And if the mailing list eats the attachment:

There is a paper (out there, somewhere) that describes the behavior of 
materials in Radiance.  In there, it says that for plastic with 
roughness greater than zero, where a reflected ray hits a light source, 
that ray is not used in the calculation because that would be 
double-counting.  I believe this is the cause of your two distinct 
renderings.  Perhaps someone else has some ideas as to how to get a 
rougher material that still renders a decent reflection of an area light?

P.S.
I had a look at your website Ian, any chance you might want to share 
those perl scripts you have that generated your sphereflake and water 
geometries?  I'm always interested in seeing geometry generators that 
people have created.

(Meant to copy this to radiance-general, but I guess I missed.)

Hi Ian,

This behavior is the same as for Radiance 3.6.  (I just checked.)   
You can increase the -dj parameter to 1 and get a better result.   
Decreasing -ds also helps somewhat, but setting -ds 0 makes it look  
unnatural.  Increasing the roughness also alleviates the problem --  
it's just when you're on the boundary that you'll have trouble.

An alternative is to use a perfectly smooth material modified by a  
random texture function that simulates roughness without applying the  
BRDF model in Radiance, like so:

# A glossy surface
void texfunc ball_roughness
4 gloss_dx gloss_dy gloss_dz gloss.cal
0
3 0.01 0.01 0.01

ball_roughness plastic white3
0
0
5       0.9     0.9     0.9
         0.05    0.0

-Greg

P.S.  There are two relevant references for materials in Radiance, as  
Rob mentioned:

Message-ID: <1296.132.248.209.37.1124917144.squirrel@132.248.209.37>


   hi all,

   I'm starting to use Radiance and I want to work with it in order to
simulate both daylight and artificial light. I want to change both the
RGB propeties of the light source and the materials. After Radiance
analizes the scene one can obtain as the output data, the luminance of
any point I select in my scene. Besides knowing what is the luminance
in any desired point, I'm very interested in knowing what is the RGB
component also of any point of the scene (such as if I were measuring
the RGB spectral component in several points of a room with a
spectometer). Is that possible? And if yes, what do you recommend me to
do in order to obtain this as an output data?

   I would appreciate any help.

Than you,
-adriana

Thanks for that info. I tried your texfunc suggestion but it didn't seem to
be giving the effect I was after. Then I read about "plastic" in
materials.ps:

	If the surface roughness (a5) is zero or the specularity (rs) is
	greater than the threshold (ts) then a ray is traced in or
	near the mirror direction.

So I set -st to just below the specularity of the balls (0.05) and set
their roughness to the value I wanted (0.03). This gave a better effect and
seemed faster. I'm still using the texfunc modifier on a dielectric
material I need to match with the plastic (the transparent window over the
numbers on the billiard balls). So thanks for that.

Thanks.

Ok, I've put up a new page:
http://www.ian.testers.homelinux.net/radiance/contribs

I've added my mkbubbles.pl script there. I'll look at adding more scripts
later. The problem is that I've written a few Perl modules for
vector and matrix maths, and simple radiance scene reading/writing. Most of
my perl scripts for Radiance use these modules. I'm not sure how much of a
hassle this will be for other people wanting to use my per scripts. Is it
easier for people to install a few small modules of mine, or for me to
modify my scripts to not use these modules?

I have my newer renderings up in my deviantART gallery along with some
photos:
http://imroy.deviantart.com/gallery/

Here's an older version of the billiard balls from about a month ago. My
first rendering with Radiance 3.7's DOF feature:

Message-ID: <B2E7A4E49B892841A8027F6D196AC6650653AE90@exchange12.utility.pge.com>


Hello! This is my first post/question...

I have been using Radiance on and off for about a year and a half, and
now I am delving into high dynamic range images. I am trying to create
accurate and precise false color luminance maps from HDR images. I took
a series of pictures each with 5 exposures, and found out quickly that
was not enough for what I am trying to accomplish. The luminance values
(as displayed by photosphere and the false color I created) looked about
right, with the exception of particularly bright portions of the image,
which were damped by not having enough exposures. The extreme values are
quite important to me.

I decided to start over, and took 11 exposures of a scene: 5
underexposed, 5 overexposed, 1 properly exposed (each a full f-stop
apart) with a Nikon D100. The proper exposure was determined by the
camera using matrix metering. The most underexposed image had a small
portion that seemed to be washed out with white, but I can't take any
more underexposed due to my camera (I don't think this is causing my
problem, anyway). I created an HDR image using photosphere, and chose
'save new response' and 'align images', leaving the rest of the fields
unchecked. Clicked go, and created the hdr image. The image _looks_
good, but I think that the values are likely quite a bit off.

I measured several values in the scene with a luminance meter (recently
calibrated Minolta LS-110) and all of them are 15-20 times less than the
values suggested by photosphere. The values I was seeing with 5
exposures were closer to the actual luminance meter values, but I have a
feeling now, that was a coincidence. 

I will be happy to provide the jpegs and/or the hdr that I created if
they will serve to discover my problem.

Any help or insight would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

Hi Adriana,

if I'm not mistaken you want to look into the use of 'pvalue'.
Note, that RGB values will give you some idea about the colorimetric 
properties of any point in the scene, but if you are remotely interested 
in accurate data - your comparison with the spectroradiometer suggests 
this - then you might want to look into spectral rendering. You can also 
do that with RADIANCE. see e.g. Yang & Maloney, 2001, Vision Research, 
41:2581-2600 (the appendix).
As far as I remember RADIANCE will return RGB values < 0 and > 1, and 
it's up to you how you interpret this data, i.e. outside of the 
RGB-gamut of the default phosphors (also somewhere defined in RADIANCE), 
which will definitely become an issue with day-light scenes.

Good luck!

alexa

Hi Halley,

Don't know if you remember me, but I met you at AEC a couple months ago 
when I interviewed here...

Anyhoo, have you read the photosphere intro?  I know Photosphere is an 
OSX application, but you should download it (from www.anyhere.com) 
anyway just for the "getting started" guide. It is an excellent 
reference for, well, getting started with HDR photography.  The first 
thing you need to do is shoot a good scene and use that for capturing 
your camera response curve.  Come to think of it, what *are* you using 
to create the HDRs?  I highly recommend Greg's Photosphere, or if you 
don't have a Mac handy, the linux-based hdrgen.  Once you have the 
camera response saved, you can try to get some more hdr sequences and 
test the accuracy again.  Bear in mind that really high dynamic range 
scenes are difficult if not impossible to capture in their entirety.  In 
particular, direct sun is the real challenge.  Also make sure that auto 
white balance is switched off, and that you are using aperture priority 
to control the exposures.

The way to test if you are capturing the entire dynamic range is that 
your darkest image should have no white pixels, and your brightest image 
should have no black pixels.  Also bear in mind that if you are 
comparing luminances at areas of very high contrast, you will also have 
trouble getting accurate samples from your luminance meter, and thus 
will have trouble getting numbers to match up.  If you follow the 
getting started guide, shoot a good scene for the camera response curve, 
and take sufficient images to capture the dynamic range of your scenes, 
you *can* get accurate HDR images. I've got some crap around here 
somewhere that shows what happens when you don't take enough shots of 
the scene, and I also have my calibration image sequence, I just have to 
find them.  They may be useful to you, so if you want them I'll send 
them to you (when I find them). 

Have fun.

I'd say it's probably easier to just load your modules (of course, I 
haven't looked at Perl in a while but I *believe* it's as easy as adding 
Python modules (?)).  But as the author of the program, you pretty much 
get to do whatever you wish. ;-)

Message-ID: <BAY102-F76B0E9F2F307CCE719B8DA4AB0@phx.gbl>

Dear Group

I have recently attempted to calibrate my scanner using a Macbeth Color 
Chart in conjunction with Radiance's macbethcal. I have run into some issues 
with 1-3 of my colors (depending on the scanner settings) being out of gamut 
from reviewing by debug.pic. What I would like to know is if there is any 
way to rectify this situation? If not, how concerned should I be with this? 
I wish to use calibrated colors in order to match some of the paint color 
swatches that are available at many hardware stores for use in my 
renderings.  Regarding my scanner, I am using an Epson Perfection 2480. Its 
a great scanner and therefore I wish not to have to replace it in order to 
experiment in finding another scanner that will keep the colors within 
gamut. As far as my scanner settings, I choose no auto exposure (selecting 
this option too leaves some colors out of gamut) and no color correction. 
Any thoughts or ideas?

Thanks

Marcus

Hi Marcus,

It is normal due to gamut issues for some saturated colors to be out  
of gamut.  Even if macbethcal issues a warning about some moderate  
colors being out of gamut, it may not be a serious problem, and you  
should judge based on your results.  If you have access to a  
colorimeter, you could check the RGB values against it with the  
xyz_rgb.cal file in the ray/src/cal/cal directory using icalc or  
rcalc as described in:

     http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/digests_html/v2n8_1b.html#COLOR_AND

I hope this helps.
-Greg

Thanks for the tips, Greg.. looks like I'll b renaming my pics to hdr

I've been out on vacation and temporarily turned off delivery. San Juan
Islands were great, thanks for asking ;-P

So this is mainly a test to see if its back on.. I saw on the archives there
were messages that came after I turned it back on, (Aug29) but I have not
yet received any

I've upgraded to Tiger, and now I have problems changing the default to
open
pic files with Photosphere
What I do:
 select a .pic file - Get info
it will open with Preview - I tell it to open with Photosphere
I select "Change All" to make all my .pic file to open with Photosphere
I get a pop-up and I confirm that's what I want to do
I go back to the get info screen - and its set to open with Preview.

 i can do it one at a time, but I can't get it to change all.

Anyone have any ideas?
I trashed ~Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices.plist
Also ran Disk utlilty and repaired permissions
Any ideas?

here's some screenshots

BTW - Preview now opens hdr and exr files - which may be part of the
problem
