Hello all,

Since this is the first message on THE LIST this side of the New Year, I wish
you all a happy and productive 2006. I hope it's going to be better than
2005, and worse than 2007 will be.

And here comes my question:

I was wondering if anybody has any idea as to if there is a MIME type for
HDR images. This is for dishing out HDR through an HTTP server, and if
left undefined, HDRs get served as 'BIN file', which isn't particularly
elegant, and makes assigning the default browser behaviour ('open with
ximage') rather challenging.

Is there a kinda standards body looking after those MIME types, or is this
left to the distributors/developers of OSes, desktop environments and
apps?

Cheers

Axel

Hello,
 
Since about 10 months, I am having an unexpected problem with the material trans. The direct component (argument 7) always cases 0 illuminance values. Was there a change in the material definition?

Hi Martin,

I'm not sure I understand your question.  Could you restate it more  
clearly?

Are you speaking of the rpict/rtrace -i+ rendering option?  In this  
case, trans materials will be ignored, treated as if they were not  
there at all, regardless of the real arguments.  The same is true for  
dielectric and glass materials.  This is designed to avoid the  
confusing situation where you see the irradiance arriving at a window  
rather than the irradiance on the objects visible through it.

Hi Martin,

You still aren't giving enough hints as to your problem.  What is  
your scene?  Which version of Radiance are you using?

I just ran a few sanity checks with the rtrace -I option and the  
latest HEAD release on a trans material, and all seems well.

Radiance 3.5 official LBNL release March 21 2003
 
Scene = a box 3X3X3 m with a south facing window. 
 
Trans = 
0.31   0.31   0.31     0.01     0.02     0.3443     0.191
 
points.inp:
1.5 -.5 1.5       0 -1 0
1.5 0.1 1.5       0 -1 0
 
I assume the following formulae:
 
ts = direct transmittance = 0.02
td = diffuse transmittance = 0.85
rs_a = ts_a = roughness = 0.02
rs = specularity
 
A1 = A2 = A3 = rd / ( (1-rs)*(1-A6) )
A4 = rs = 0.01
A5 = (rs * rs_a _ ts * ts_a) / (rs + ts)
A6 = (td + ts) / (rd + td  + ts)
A7 = ts / (td + ts)
 
Is that correct? 
 
Martin

Hi,

I am just taking a look at the different sky models available for radiance.
There was a cal file to describe the new standard sky model by Phillip
Greenup mentioned on this list a while ago, is it avilable somewhere?

There used to be a extensions section on radiance-online, didn't it? I have
no &#305;dea where to search at the moment.

Thanks and CU Lars.

That is what I use to look at HDR images on Windows computers.  Once you assign the 'open with', it always works.

Is there a kinda standards body looking after those MIME types, or is this

No, I am looking for the MIME type. If you click on any of the .hdr images
on this page:
http://athens.ict.usc.edu/Probes/
the web server tells you it's a BIN file. Assigning a default application
therefor depends on the extension. This is .hdr on the page you quoted,
but no-one can stop me from serving HDR images with an extension .axl .
This is where the MIME type kicks in: Once my web server knows that both,
.hdr and .axl (and maybe .pic) are of type X-HIGH-DYNAMIC-RANGE, for
example, it will dish out the proper MIME type, and not say it's a BIN
(which is kinda saying "I've no idea what I'm delivering here...")

Thanks for the link.

Cheers

Axel

Hi Axel,
A google on MIME found these sites, which might answer your questions.

http://www.mhonarc.org/~ehood/MIME/
http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/
http://www.ietf.org/    (type MIME into the ietf search box for a link 
to 2 memos on MIME types)

Out of curiosity I tried the "athens..." site. I was able to download 
to the desktop and open with Photosphere. The hdr extension was 
preserved.

Hi Martin,

Thanks for writing to let me know all is well with trans, if a bit  
confusing...  (But we knew that!)

While I agree that the -i option would be better to show arriving  
irradiance on some trans surfaces, it's a hack to begin with, and the  
behavior is more predictable if it switches based on material type  
rather than material parameters.

Your formulas for the trans arguments look correct, except your A5  
calculation, the specular roughness:

> A5 = (rs * rs_a _ ts * ts_a) / (rs + ts)

Perhaps you meant:

A5 = (rs * rs_a + ts * ts_a) / (rs + ts)

This seems a reasonable way to compute an average value for the  
roughness.

-Greg

I took a bunch of HDR images and forgot to record the focal length. The Nikon Coolpix 5400 zoom does not show it anyway. Is there a way to derive it or get it somehow from the images? These are jpegs.

Hi Martin,

Most Nikon cameras record the focal length in the Exif header, which  
you can read using the "File Info..." menu item in Photoshop, or  
using Nikon's own viewing software, available as a trial version from  
their website:

Martin,

> Most Nikon cameras record the focal length in the Exif header

.. just to confirm what Greg said: I've put a text file with the EXIF info
of a 4500 up under:
http://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/webhdr/pickup/NIKON__E4500.exif

I don't have a 5400 in my little collection. This is as close as it gets.

Just pulling three lines out of this file:
FocalLengthIn35mmFormat => 38
FocalLength35efl => 7.8mm (35mm equivalent: 38.0mm)
FocalLength => 7.8mm

Voila! Your're in business.

You might want to take a look at the Reveal software which is available
for LINUX, MacOS, and even Windows:
http://albumshaper.sourceforge.net/index.shtml
It's a GUI thing allowing you to read and edit the EXIF info.

And of course there's alwas Perl::Image::Exiftool, if you're into
automating and scripting... Look on CPAN.org

Cheers

Axel

Hi All,

Happy New Year first off.

I am making a first pass through the "High Dynamic Range Imaging" book 
that Greg co-authored. I am wondering about methods for generating a 
good response curve for a given camera. The book gives a variety of tips 
and suggestions, however I am curious about good scenes.

In a prior email footnote from Greg (a faq item relating to camera 
response curves and Photosphere), he suggests shooting a scene looking 
out a window during daytime with about 10 exposures. What about shooting 
a controlled scene such as a Macbeth Color Checker or a Kodak gray scale 
chart (can't remember the name of this) outdoors under daytime 
conditions or using some type of interior fixed lighting setup?

Hi Jack,

I've just been playing around with this, myself.  To get a good  
response curve, it is best to start with a scene that has a daylight  
color balance, as this is the design point for most cameras, and some  
models end up boosting the blue too much if you calibrate under  
incandescent lighting.  For this reason, I prefer calibrating with  
natural light, as opposed to a controlled condition with incandescent  
or fluorescent lighting.  In any case, you should fixed a white  
balance setting on the camera appropriate to the test lighting.   
(Memory aid:  If the white balance isn't fixed, then it's broken.)

Color charts are of limited use, except as a means to verify your  
calibration.  The more images you take in a sequence, and the more  
closely they are spaced, the less you rely on the recorded camera  
response function.  This is because the overlap of the images serves  
(together with the known shutter speeds) to give you an accurate  
result, regardless.  It is more important to have an absolute  
calibration value if you are after real numbers, and for this a  
luminance measurement on a reference card of known reflectance is  
invaluable.

Hi Greg,

Thanks for the follow-up on this. I think that I have gotten the white 
balance part correct. I always set it by hand (for example to the sun 
icon) so the auto white balance feature is effectively off. And I have 
used aperture priority on the camera however I have used auto 
bracketing, so maybe I am not getting enough samples? It sound like 
perhaps the best thing to do is set the aperture manually and vary the 
exposure time manually as well in order to generate your suggested ~10 
samples. Although doing everything manually involves a lot of 
unnecessary touch of the camera.

So as to scene, clear sunny sky conditions would be ideal I suppose with 
a range from shadowed features to direcly illuminated features... Sorry 
for this next... So how do you use the luminance measure from the 
reference card to further calibrate the response curve?

Once a response curve has been generated is there some way to check or 
validate it (if that makes any sense)?

In the book (the new one;-) you also indicate that the darkest exposure 
should have no RGB values greater than ~200 and the lightest no values 
less than ~20. I could certainly figure out a filter routine with pcomb, 
however there must be a simple way to do this with ImageMagick. The 
point being to run a quick preprocess check on the the bounding images. 
Any takers or suggestions for how to do this easily?

-Jack

Yeah, for this calibration sequence, you definitely need more samples 
than a typical auto-bracket will do.  Fixed aperture, varied exposure, 
and shoot from a tripod if you can.  The Canon Rebels are really nice 
because you can adjust the exposure with a little roller wheel; once you 
have the WB and aperture set, you just roll the wheel & click, roll the 
wheel & click, etc.  My Olympus requires a lot more futzing with menus 
to do manual exposure and it's impossible to shoot a decent sequence w/o 
a tripod.

I dunno about validating a response curve, but I'd expect you could 
measure the scene with a luminance meter while you're shooting it, and 
then compare those values to some samples from the hdr image.

I just open the high & low images in Photoshop and look at the 
histogram.  Are you trying to figure out a way to automate this step 
from the command line?

In my experience, this is indeed the best thing to do.

In the header of the RGBE image you'll find an exposure value. Multiply
this with your calibration factor. This CF will be roughly one, but not
quite.

The netpbm utilities allow you to easily create histograms. I use this in
WebHDR: For each uploaded image, the histogram is plotted, and the
exposure value given. Give it a try, if you like.

I understand that ImageMagick can also give you histograms.

Hey this is great! Though I am still not exactly clear what to do with 
the CF if it is other than 1.0? Am I using this multiplier to correct 
the exposure value of the image?

Yes. You multiply the exposure value in the RADIANCE header with this
Calibration Factor.

Subject: [Radiance-general] trans - georg vs greg vs book
Message-ID: <1136846641.18511.251455431@webmail.messagingengine.com>

Hi all,

We've all gone over trans several times and there appears to be much
confusion about the parameters.  I present an inconsistency when working
from

(1) Radiance book
(2) Georg's diagram
(http://www.schorsch.com/rayfront/manual/transdef.html)
(3) Greg Ward's emailed example (Desktop Radiance Digest v2n7, Sep 1994,
in RADIANCE_HOME/doc/digest/v2n7).

Clearing up of the inconsistency will help me and many others!

To summarise my understanding the trans arguments

A1,A2,A3 - colour components.  As shown by "colour" diamond in Georg's
diagram. Fraction of light NOT absorbed for each component.=
A4, A5 - specular reflection, roughness (ignore, 0 for following
examples)
A6 - trans ("trans" diamond on georg's diagram).  (ie, fraction
non-absorbed light transmitted through material.)
A7 - specular proportion of transmitted light (ignore)

According to the Radiance Book:

A1 = Cr / (1-Rs)(1-A6)

*I assume that A6 = "trans" diamond on georg's diagram.*

Greg's example:

Requirement: grey trans material.  Transmission factor of 60% (ie
*total* amount of light going through).  Specular component of 10%:

void trans opale
0
0
7 .6 .6 .6 0 0 1 .1666

ie
A1 = 0.6
A6 = 1

We adapt a number of his formulae to show this meets the requirements.
>From Georg's diagram (note no reflection, as per Greg's example)

Diffuse reflectance Rd = (1 - Rs)(colour)(1 - trans)            
                       = (1 - 0 )(0.6   )(1 - 1    )
                       = 1 x 0.6 x 0
                       = 0 (ie no diffuse reflectance, => 40% is
                       absorbed)


Diffuse transmittance Td = (1 - Rs)(colour)(trans)(1 - Tspec)
                         = (1 - 0 )(0.6   )(1    )(1 - 0.1666)
                         = 50%

Specular transmittance Ts = (1 - Rs)(colour)(trans)(Tspec)
                          = (1 - 0 )(0.6   )(1    )(0.1666)
			  = 10%

That's great and seems to make sense.

But - the inconsistency:

Plug this example into Radiance book's formula.  (Stiil assume Rs=0.)

A1 = Cr / (1 - Rs)(1 - A6)
A1 = Cr / (1 - 0 )(1 - A6)
A1 = Cr / (1 - A6)


* Now consider what happens as A6 approaches 1.  A1 tends to infinity -
clearly not correct.*

My questions are then:

-   Is A6 = trans (in the diamond in Georg's diagram) as both Greg and
Georg appear to show.  (ie. is A6 the fraction the non-absorbed light
that is not diffusely reflected?)
-   If so, why doesn't the Radiance book formula make sense?
-   What is Cr, Cb and Cg?
-   Does total transmissivity = (1 - Rs)(colour)(trans) ?       


Thanks for reading and thinking!

Cheers,

Brett

You can actually edit the header using the getinfo command in the  
following sequence:

getinfo < orig.hdr > fixed.hdr
vi fixed.hdr
getinfo - < orig.hdr >> fixed.hdr

In your editor (vi in the example above), either replace the  
EXPOSURE= line with a corrected value, or add a new EXPOSURE= line  
with the correciton, equal to image_value/measured_value.

Photosphere makes this easy by allowing you to select a region and  
enter the correct luminance value via the pop-up "Calibration" menu  
item on the "Apply" button of the image display window.  You also  
have the option of applying this calibration factor to the camera's  
recorded response function, so it will adjust future exposure  
sequences from the same camera.

Photosphere also has a histogram feature, as well as live false color  
luminance display.  It might be worth $500 to get a Mac mini --  
cheaper than a copy of Photoshop.

Hi Jack,

Is it you how is a 'Digial Rebel'? If so, then I never realised you were
into German Nutcrackers. Nice view outta your window.

How did you find the interactive Luminance Map? Did it work for you?

Hi Axel,

I guess the rest of us missed the message you're referring to, so  
maybe this was posted to the group by mistake...

The false color feature of Photosphere is new, thanks to the generous  
support of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, under a contract with  
NYSERDA for the New York Times.  You need to download the latest  
version from www.anyhere.com and find it in the "View" menu.

Dear all,

I am pleased to announce quite a bucket load of improvements to WebHDR.

For those of you who are unaware of WebHDR: It's a web-based package on
top of Greg's hdrgen, allowing you to generate HDR images on-line. We use
it for teaching purposes on our Masters course.

Here are the improvements:
- interactive Luminance Map
- demo mode
- updates/corrections everywhere
- facilitates Response Curve Calibration and Absolute Luminance Calibration
- output of tone-mapped JPEG
- gallery page
- option to remove lens flare
- histograms are generated for every uploaded image
- 'Test your camera' page to make sure your camera is supported by WebHDR
- now supports more cameras than Greg's hdrgen

Please do give it a try. If you don't have an exposure bracketed sequence
at hand, please upload any old picture to the Camera Test page to help me
improve the software. Your uploads are completely anonymous.

Cheers

Axel

Hi Brett,

You see, my clever plan in designing the "trans" material arguments  
was a lifetime of guaranteed consultancy, advising others in how to  
set its parameters.  Unfortunately, Georg has really undermined this  
plan by creating the excellent diagram you refer to, explaining how  
trans actually works, leading me to consider changing the parameters  
just to keep everyone guessing.

It does, but not for surfaces that are 100% specular or 100%  
transmissive.

> -   What is Cr, Cb and Cg?

These are the diffuse reflection values for red, green, and blue, and  
they will be 0 if either A4 or A6 are 1.0 due to energy balance  
constraints.

> -   Does total transmissivity = (1 - Rs)(colour)(trans) ?

Yes.

Basically, the problem you point out has to do with the formulation  
in RwR, which relies on a non-zero value for the diffuse reflection.   
If either A4 or A6 are 1.0,  then it follows that the diffuse  
reflection (Cr,Cg,Cb) must be zero for energy to balance, and the  
formulae for A1 to A3 give you 0/0, which is indeterminate (not  
infinity).

This is the main reason why trans has the confusing specification it  
does (besides keeping me employed) -- its parameterization has well- 
defined physical ranges.  All parameters except the roughness (A5)  
should be between 0 and 1.0, and any combination of parameter values  
in this range yields a physically valid model.

I hope this clears up your confusion.  If not, my rates are really  
quite reasonable....

Hi Brett,

regarding your trans question and to confuse you even more:
There's no such thing as "Specular transmittance" for scattering
materials. All "transmittance" values [0..1] are integrals over the BRTF
times incident radiance, with the BRTF limited by [0...infinity] . In
case of an ideal specular BRTF (ideal glass), a "specular transmittance"
is readily defined, but for all other cases it is necessary to specify
over which solid angle the BRTF was integrated (that's why there's a
*diffuse* transmittance under all circumstances, - that integral
extends over the hemisphere). Specularwise it gets all very ugly and has
been an efficient source for a lot of confusion. IMHO, the easiest way
is to stick to the BRTF and even then it is worth clearly separating
between an ideal BRTF (which may be a delta function) and
measurements/simulations (which both deal with folded, aka integrated,
BRTFs, so no delta-functions). This holds also true for "trans", whose
BRTF gets more "peakish" (delta-like) with lower roughness values.

http://www.pab-opto.de/pers/phd/apian_phd.pdf (in German, sorry for
that) lists the transmittance defs on (acrobat page numbering) page 31
and the trans BRTF on page 131.

Hi all,

I thought I might as well add another thought to this thread:

Given a dozen or so subtly different RSP files for the same camera, I am
wondering how one would go about combining them into one, averaging them,
so to say.

Gutfeeling tells me that it's probably not as simple as taking the
arithmetic average of the 12 individual coefficients across the dozen
RSPs.

Greg et al -

Regarding Photosphere and the creation of HDR images from multiple  
exposure LDR images:  is there any advantage to the process by using  
higher bit RAW or TIFF (12-16 bit) linear LDRs when combining them  
into an HDR, or does it not matter or actually make the process  
harder or less efficient, etc.?  Just curious.

I've been reading and rereading the Tone Mapping chapters in the new  
book trying to get a theoretical and physical basis for the machinery  
working behind the scenes in Photosphere/hdrgen.  Pretty cool stuff.

Thanks,

Hi Kirk,

There generally isn't much difference between camera RAW and JPEG in  
terms of resolution.  The main difference is that we don't need to  
second-guess what the camera is doing or figure out the response  
function (in most cases).

Working on the NYSERDA project again, I've developed a prototype  
script based on Dave Coffin's dcraw.c that converts camera RAW  
directly into 24-bit BMP with a known gamma, then takes this into  
hdrgen to compute the final HDR image.  I have done numerous  
experiments with this process and compared them to dealing only with  
JPEGs, and there's not a lot of difference between the two methods.   
In general, I would say that the RAW translation offers better color  
fidelity, but suffers from greater noise.  The color difference is  
attributable to the odd color manipulations that happen in the  
camera.  The noise difference no doubt has a lot to do with the noise  
reduction that happens in many digital cameras, which is bypassed  
using RAW directly.

-Greg

P.S.  Bear in mind that although most RAW image files are 12 bits,  
they are 12 bits of linear range, which isn't really any better than  
8 bits using a standard 2.2 gamma.

Makes sense.  I was curious about this simply because I wondered how  
robust the Camera Response Curves are in accounting for camera-based  
pre-processing.  Some cameras do things to the RAW data to enhance  
contrast, boost saturation etc. and then write the JPEG.  Some  
cameras allow the user to define the amount of this processing (I'm  
thinking of the Canon Digital Rebel that I shoot with, but I imagine  
that many cameras now offer user control of these parameters in some  
form).  Do the camera response curves essentially account for these  
settings inasmuch as they affect the way the camera "exposes" the RAW  
image data from the sensor (referring to your statement below about  
second-guessing what the camera is doing)?  I know that generating  
HDR images from multi-exposure LDR images "demands" that auto-white  
balance not be used - are there similar suggestions for the camera- 
based pre-processing parameters like contrast, saturation, etc. that  
may affect HDR generation or is that essentially what the curves  
compensate for (assuming that the same exact pre-processing camera  
parameters are applied to each image)?  Because these pre-processing  
algorithms are automated, would they necessarily be applied  
consistently across the entire range of exposures or could they  
introduce some sort of changing response similar to a changing white  
balance that might affect the combination of the LDRs and the  
extraction of a response curve?

I suppose I could experiment by setting the parameters on my Digital  
Rebel to combinations of extrema in a relatively controlled lighting  
situation and see if it matters, but I'm not sure I would know what  
to look for to measure any differences that might occur.  Clearly my  
limited understanding of the physics is being exposed here (my  
limited understanding has a very large apparent dynamic range) -  
which may mean that in my dimwitted approach, it may not matter anyway!
:-)

Thanks,

Hi Kirk,

You've jammed a lot of questions in here, so let me try to take them  
one or two at a time....

Essentially correct.  So long as you stick to the same settings for  
your exposure sequences, and the camera is not automatically  
adjusting the tone curve, you should get reproducible results out of  
Photosphere/hdrgen.  Typically, the aperature-preferred or manual  
mode you will use for exposure bracketing precludes automatic tone- 
curves.

Consistency is the main thing.  After that, you are better off  
without aggressive color and tone enhancement, and sharpening.   
Boosting color saturation (as many cameras like to do) intermingles  
the color channels in nasty, non-invertible ways.  Boosted contrast  
limits the dynamic range of each exposure.  Sharpening makes image  
alignment errors more noticeable.

As I said above, the aperture-preferred and manual modes of most  
cameras disables per-image tone dickering.

I spent the better part of a day last week taking shots of a Macbeth  
ColorChecker chart in the many modes of the Canon EOS 5D I have on  
loan from LBNL, and concluded that there were small differences to be  
seen, particularly in terms of color accuracy, but for most  
applications this is not going to be a make or break consideration.   
Stick with the most neutral, faithful, unaltered mode your camera  
offers, and JPEG should work fine.

Well ... anyone actually seen one of these yet?

Does this Mac/Intel paradigm shift make any difference to the way  
RADIANCE and Photosphere, etc. are implemented in Mac OSX?  (sorry  
for the Mac-specific detour here....).

Pretty cool.

Hi Kirk,

Radiance should definitely be recompiled for the Intel platform, and  
I will endeavor to supply binaries for both architectures in the next  
release.  Photosphere can be cross-compiled using Xcode 2, and I will  
be testing that just as soon as someone I know picks up one of the  
new Intel-based Apples.  (It seems very strange to use "Intel" and  
"Apple" in the same sentence without "versus" in between.)  The iMac  
is supposedly out as of today, but the Mac Book Pro isn't shipping  
until February.

The main difference from a programming standpoint between the two  
machines is that the PowerPC family is BigEndian while Intel is  
LittleEndian (different byte orders).  This can affect binary files  
that are not machine-independent.  In Radiance, this includes  
holodeck files and depth buffers (-z option of rpict).  I think  
that's it.  All the other standard file types are designed to port  
across architectures.  Photosphere uses a byte-ordering translator on  
its binary catalog file, but I haven't had the chance to actually  
test it up until now.  It will be working when I make an universal  
version available.

You can see <http://www.apple.com/rosetta/> for more information.

-Greg

P.S.  I'm kicking myself a bit for having bought a new PowerBook last  
Summer.  Hopefully, Rob Guglielmetti held off with his Christmas  
purchase.  Everyone said that the iBooks would be the first to  
switch, but apparently not.

Yup, and very glad I did (thanks to you and another friend who told me 
to wait).  I'm gonna order one very soon, I think.  Thanks for the 
detailed response to Kirk's question; I'm ready to take the plunge!

please just wait until april... you know, apple release 1.0 is always a
little buggy....
just my suggestion, based on previous past experiences :-)

Greg - thanks for the explanation and your dedication to staying  
ahead of the curve and supporting all of the RADIANCE user communities.

 From what I read leading up to this release, it was clear that Apple  
wanted to finally move its laptops to the next level, hence the Intel  
chipset.  I have a feeling that, as with most things Apple, there  
will be issues - but the Apple faithful (me included) are willing to  
be beta testers and see the bugginess as a badge of honor in some  
convoluted way (paying money to be a beta tester will do that to your  
rationalizing psyche I suppose).  It is weird to mention Apple and  
Intel as complements, but I think all Mac users (again, me included)  
realize Apple's shortcomings, even if we tend to defend the brand to  
the death.

As Rob said:

> Dual core laptop?  Yes, please...

I imagine that a 17" version of the Intel dual core laptop can;t be  
far behind, given the performance-oriented, graphics-driven market  
the new platform will benefit.....  Wouldn't it be interesting if  
Apple offered a 17" HDR display laptop someday? [wink]

I was a defender (and early-adopter of the PPC with a PowerMac 7600 (33 
MHz!!)), then a hater for a few years as I grew tired of bomb icons and 
the like, but it was Greg's statement that he got Radiance compiled on 
OSX that brought me back to the fold.  It is really OSX that I love so 
much, more so than Apple, but their product design is quite pretty too 
(altho that magnetic power adapter looks a bit flaky).  Giulio, I hear 
ya.  But it's been a long time since I've done the early adopter thing, 
and I've been putting off upgrading my PB for a while as well, so I'm

out; I ordered mine last night!

Although it seems as if they lost money having three sizes and decided 
to focus on the best seller, slightly increasing the size (15.4" instead 
of the old 15").  It just may be the sweet spot.  Who knows?

Hey Rob and other Apple afficianados,

Greg suggested that it might be worth it to by a mac-mini so I can run 
photosphere. Any hints, comments or otherwise about what might be a 
suitable configuration. As you know I am a Linux fanatic, so I really do 
not know that much about Apple configs.....

Surprise ;->

I haven't spent much time looking at minis, but from what I can tell, 
for what you want to do, the base config (the $500 one Greg mentioned) 
would be fine.  The other ones cost $100-$200 more for incremental cpu 
speed increases and a DVD burner (which you probably already have). 

Of course, once you start using OSX, you'll want to keep on using it, 
for more than just Photosphere. Honestly, the only thing keeping a 
Windows machine on my desk at work is AutoCAD.  Everything else is much 
more pleasant to do on OSX, especially Radiance and all things command 
line.  But I know you have a well-established workflow, so if you truly 
only want this Mac hardware for Photosphere, I'd go for the basic $500 
Mini.

Yes this is my conclusion as well. And just FYI we are completely on the 
same page about Windows. The only reason I have a windows machine around 
is really to run AutoCAD. If there was some other reasonable/realiable 
alternate that would run on Linux then I could be free. Though I think 
that Intellicad has a Linux based version, but as with you, probably 
having maximum interoperability with client provided data is important 
(as if even then it is maximally interoperable)....

Bricscad offers a Linux version of their Intellicad based products.

See http://www.bricscad.com

 From the newsgroups I get that this version (Windows) of Intellicad is
(once again ...) a big leap in terms of compatibility. But I guess there
are as many requirements for AutoCAD compatibility as there are  
companies
using it.

About the Mac mini:

You can stick with the base model but you should increase the memory
to at least 512 MB (base for the smallest mini was 256 MB, don't know
where it's now).

You could always bribe Greg to add the new features to the Linux
version of Photosphere, too.

Yes they seem to have the most stable well developed version of 
Intellicad. I keep meaning to take a more serious look at it. But it can 
even be a pain between different variants of Autocad (eg, basic autocad 
and adt for example).

Gee, I am pretty sure that there is not a Linux version of Photosphere. 
But if this is otherwise..... Though, there are several command line 
tools  (hdrgen)  that he has kindly made available  in compiled form for 
Linux/Unix.

It is 512 MB now, and usable but suboptimal for image stuff.   
Upgrading memory is a bit painful, but doable:

You must be thinking of hdrgen.  There is no Photosphere for Linux  
(or Windows), unfortunately.  Maybe in half a year or so, if things  
go as planned.  I won't be doing the development myself, but I'm  
scheming to get BrightSide to pay for porting Photosphere to Windows,  
which they would offer commercially.  Out of it, we would also get a  
free Linux version.  It's all very iffy at this point, though...   
Sort of like counting on running Windows apps. natively on the new  
Intel-based Macs.  It could happen.

Hi,
 
Can you please list a few peer-reviewed journal and conference papers that deal directly or indirectly with the validation of Radiance? Probably Reinhardt and Walkenhorst in Energy and Buildings, and Mardaljevic in LR+T - any others? If you could list the details, I'd appreciate it - good to know for everybody. 
 
Many thanks

Here is ours, currently in press:

A. I. Ruppertsberg and M. Bloj, 2006, Rendering complex scenes for psychophysics
using RADIANCE: how accurate can you get?, J. Opt. Soc. Am. A, in press.

for a free download of the non-typeset version go here:
http://josaa.osa.org/upcoming_pdf.cfm?id=63954

In particular we've looked at accuracy for different colour coding variants:
RGB, sRGB and spectral rendering with a strong emphasis on colour accuracy (and
luminance of course). For validation we compared rendering results with
measurements from the real-world counterpart scene.

cheers,

Subject: [Radiance-general] UV mapping in Radiance
Message-ID: <719B858C-432A-44B3-ADB4-CF9B392F7588@biomechanicsinc.com>

Folks - I have been reading up on the basics of using UV mapping in  
3D modeling apps, in general to apply textures, etc. to complex 3D  
surfaces with greater control.

Does anyone use UV mapping here with Radiance?  Is there some  
workflow that has been developed to take a model from an external  
modeling app (I use Lightwave) and export a model (with a UV map and  
an applied image map) into a format that supports such mapping  
(say .OBJ) and then bring the model and its UV map and corresponding  
image map into Radiance?

Maybe this technique is fairly straightforward or maybe it involves  
more thought with respect to writing .cal files and such.

Thanks,

kirk

I've never been successful, as my 3D app doesn't export the map with the

Hi Kirk,

The mesh primitive is the best and easiest way to get UV texture  
coordinates into Radiance.  See "Fitting texture to mesh" thread from  
Oct. 2003:

Hi Erico,

you probably should use the current version of photon-mapping(4.3), 
which is for the RADIANCE 3.7. Roland made this new version some weeks ago.
I'm not sure, if this helps in your special case, but I never had such 
problems with using photon-ports and I used it several times without any 
problems (I always used the 3.28 version for RADIANCE 3.5).

We are actually reorganizing our web-pages and unfortunately the English 
(web)version is not available and the German version shows a bug in 
direct linking. That's the reason, why I haven't posted it to the 
community yet.

Anyhow, it is already on a Web-page for downloading.
You can get it on:
http://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/german/fields/field6/mb4/index.html then 
follow link on "Lichtsimulation", then "RADIANCE", then "p-map"

Good luck!

Jan

Subject: [Radiance-general] accurate light levels
Message-ID: <43C91FE4.7000203@oriel.ox.ac.uk>

hi there

As I said in my other question today (spliting a render by light 
sources) I am quite new to radiance, and I am having some issues setting 
  up my renderings. I have radiance installed and working fine, but I 
dont quite understand how I make sure the brightness of the final render 
is realistic. There are a few reasons for this:

I'm not sure what exposure setting to use with pfilt - is it as simple 
as setting '-e 1' so as not to adjust the exposure? I have tried this 
and my images all come out very dark, but this might be because I don't 
have enough light in the scene (see next paragraph, below).

Has anyone used radiance with any theatrical light fixtures? and would 
they be prepared to share the .rad files for them? I have found the .rad 
descriptions of architectural fixtures, but i'm not familiar with any of 
them, and even if I was I need to be able to use accurate models of the 
specific instruments I'll be using in theatres. I would simply build my 
own files, using the iestorad utility, but rather unhelpfully the 
instrument manufacturers dont seem willing to give out ies data.

Has anyone made any more materials information available to the public? 
I have looked through the material.rad list of materilas in the lib 
folder, but I'm specifically looking black paint and heavy black cloth 
type materials. If not, then does anyone have any recomendations of how 
to go about determining good values to use in my own materials 
definitions? I dont have access to any way of measuring reflected light 
levels in an experiment.

Thanks for your help with my probably rather basic questions
Will

Message-ID: <43C92216.90308@oriel.ox.ac.uk>

Hi there

A third question from me today, but agian I thought it better to start a 
new thread for this one too.

 From looking over the past posts it seems that something has been 
changed in the Tcl/Tk language that means that the trad utility will no 
longer run with more recent versions. Does anyone know with which 
version of Tcl/Tk this issue frst raised its head? I've only tried the 
most recent versions. I also tried to install the version I believe trad 
is meant to run under (Tcl 7.4, Tk 4) but the source for these no longer 
under the new gcc! I'm pretty new to the linux system im running (fresh 
from windows) and I dont really know what I'm doing changing code, so I 
thought I'd appeal to this list for advice about any other front-ends 
for Radiance. I'm aware of Rayfront, but unfortunately I dont have much 
budget to spend on this project (it's my 4th year undergraduate 
Engineering degree final project) and I am hoping for a free version!

Thanks again for all your help
Will

Message-ID: <43C91760.7070004@oriel.ox.ac.uk>

hi there
i'm fairly new to the radiance package, and to rendering in general, but 
i have a fairly specific project on the go, with which i need some help.

i am trying to use radiance to render a relatively simple model 
geometrically - just a simple room, with a box sitting on the floor - 
but with up to 100 or so light sources. but the difference is that i 
want to get a separte image file for each light source - i.e.  hundred 
or so images, with only 1 light on in each. i will then use 
superposition and recombine the images later, allowing me to vary the 
intensities of each light source.

is there any kind of built in functionality in radiance to allow me to 
do this, or do i have to write a shell script or something (and if so, 
can anyone point me towards a good place to learn how! i come from a 
very winndows based background)

thanks for your help

You don't have to worry much about the "brightness" of images. The  
Radiance
image file format can store a much greater dynamic range than your  
monitor
can display or your eyes can see.

The information within the images is not lost until you convert
the Radiance image (traditionally called *.pic, more resently *.hdr)
to *.tga (or similar) format which may loose all the details. You can
convert to some *.tif formats that support the full range but this
depends on the application you will use to process these images
afterwards.

And yes, using ra_t16 (for *.tga) or ra_tiff (for *.tif) it is as
simple as "-e +2" or "-e -2" to make the image brighter or darker.
Your images may in fact appear dark at the first glance when you render
a scene designed for 100 sources with one active source only.

Open your rendered image in "ximage" which is designed to handle
*.pic images. Hit the "a" key or "h" key to perform an adjustment
of the image exposure on screen, which should give you a better
rendering (on screen) of the image information. Read the man-page
of ximage for further details on the controls. Then read the man-page
of "pcond" which will create an new addjusted image.

Please note that most image manipulation tools bundled with Radiance
will work as filters and dump their output to your terminal window
when not told otherwise. Usually you will redirect the output to a
new file or "pipe" it into another program. These are basic Unix
concepts you should know to get the most out of your new Linux box.

Examples:

     pcond -h+ oldimage.pic > newimage.pic

     pcond -h+ oldimage.pic | ra_t16 -3 > newimage.tga

Rob Shakespeare, coauthor of "Rendering with Radiance" (see below)
has experiance in this field, as have some others here on the list.

IIRC there was a post a few weeks ago about theatrical lights.
I'm not shure if the poster was willing to share his homemade
messurments of some fixtures. Hope he will answer personally.

You can find a short introduction to the radiance materials
at other things here:

     http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/usman1.pdf

and here (follow link "Documentation" and start with the
"radcourse_basic.pdf" document)

     http://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/learnix/

While browsing for the link to Axel Jacobs more resent tutorials
I found this overview of materials:

http://www.learn.londonmet.ac.uk/student/resources/radiance/ 
material_db.shtml

Everyone highly recommends "The Book" about Radiance:

     http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/book/

It even includes a chapter about "Dramatic Lighting" (stage lighting).

Everyone has his/her share of problems with Radiance ;)

Don't waste your preciouse time with old dead scripts. (Or do
it right and update the code for current releases if you know
enough about TCL/TK).

You don't need much of a front end for Radiance except if you're
afraid of the command line. Most documentation you will find on
the LNBL homepage will use tipped out commands and a text editor
to create the scene files.

You can try the Radiance_on_a_Disk LEARNIX distribution by
Axel Jacobs:

     http://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/learnix/

The documentation (including the "radcourse" PDFs I mentioned in
my other post) should match this environment so you don't have
to wrestle with the installation to get examples running.

A usefull front-end for the Radiance bundle of tools is the
programm "rad" which will controll the creation of octrees etc.
for you. It's included in the Radiance distribution. Read the
man-page about how to use it.

And start learning bash.

Rayfront is one of the best front ends I know about. Perhaps
you can convince your department to invest in an educational licence?
Would be good for the development of Rayfront, too.

I hope you are aware of the fact that a incandescent light source
will have a shift of the spectrum in it's output when you change
the intensity (reduce the power for the lamp). But I don't think
you're bothered about this (small) aspect, so let's move on.

The "build in functionality" of Radiance is it's simplicity.
Small tools for small tasks. And yes, you will have to write
a script for your problem. But it will be a simple script.

First you have to organize your scene data:

a) everything that is static in the scene in one file
b) a bunch of files containing everything that isn't
    (in your case 100 files with the description of 1 light
     source each).
c) definitions of i.e. viewpoints or render parameters

The basic steps to create one image are:

1) Compile a scene octree from the static and one dynamic file
2) Render the image with the created octree as input

I don't know much about your light so I assume you have
created a "static.rad" file, 100 "dynamic.001" etc. files
and a file with render options "render.opt".

Creating your images is as simple as:

for i in `seq -w 100`
do
   oconv static.rad dynamic.${i} > tmp_scene.oct
   rpict @render.opt tmp_scene.oct > image_${i}.pic
done

Not as bad as it sounds, eh?

There is plenty of room for improvements: in particular, you don't
need all the 100 files for light sources if the vary only in
position or in other small details. That could be done within
the "for ..." loop, too. All depends on your needs.


For a simple introduction to bash google for "bash tutorial"
and try a few of the hits. It depends on you what's the right
introduction level. You can use any other scripting language
as well (Python, Perl, TCL) if you already know one.


HTH,
Thomas

If you're using linux, you can download the new pmap binaries from this page:

Shell scripts would work, but Greg has recently added to Radiance rtcontrib:
http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/man_html/rtcontrib.1.html

This man page contains already a good starting example:

"
To generate a pair of images corresponding to two lights' contributions:

         vwrays -ff -x 1024 -y 1024 -vf best.vf | rtcontrib -ffc `vwrays -d -x
         1024 -y 1024 -vf best.vf` @render.opt -o c_%s.pic -m light1 -m light2
         scene.oct

These images may then be recombined using the desired outputs of light1
and light2:

         pcomb -c 100 90 75 c_light1.pic -c  50  55  57  c_light2.pic  >  com-
         bined.pic
"

Hi Erico,

you should use RADIANCE 3.7, Patchlevel 2, which we have put also onto 
the same page. I just checked it and I could compile it without any 
problems on my linux machine.

thanks thomas and francesco for your comments.

my question about brightness was about not knowing the actual brightness 
in the real world, precisely because the monitor can't show you all the 
detail. i just wanted to check that that the original .pic image is not 
scaled at all by the exposure setting.

thanks again

Hullo again,

I would like to move this off-list because I do realise that all these
questions about HDRI are only of peripheral interest to the RADIANCE
community at large. However, a quick Google tought me that the majority of
HDR discussion seem to be going on at
http://www.hyperfocaldesign.com/,
and frankly, it doesn't seem to cut the custard for me. So please DO tell
me if there is a more appropriate List to direct this one to...

And 'ere we go:

I've just put up a few more examples on the WebHDR Gallery page, and
noticed that all of the tonemapped images are rather desaturated, compared
to what you get when hitting the old 'Do-it-all-for-me-Button' in Auto
Mode. I understand that most if not all digital consumer cameras do some
jigger-pokery colour gamut stretching, so the photos look a bit nicer.
However, my understanding is that once you've done an HDR, you can do all
sorts of things to it, probablay including those colour transform
things...

Since I am processing all results of WebHDR with RADIANCE tools, I was
wondering if there is a way of putting the colour-vibrancy back into the
tone mapped imaged.

Cheers

Axel

Hi Axel,

It seems to me that HDRI is quite relevant to this community, as there 
are a variety of people interested in the topic. Perhaps we should ask:

   1. is this topic appropriate for this particular radiance list
      (radiance-general)
   2. if not would it be worth it to set up a
      radiance-hdri@radiance-online.org

Hi Jack, Axel,

I agree that a separate HDRI mailing list makes sense, if Peter A-B  
is willing to set one up.  I would certainly participate, and it  
would save those who may not be interested from our noise.

Regarding color in HDR images, this really falls under the category  
of tone-mapping.  Most film and digital cameras increase color  
saturation according to well-worn practices, which may be found in  
R.W.G. Hunt's classic tome on color management, "The Reproduction of  
Colour" (ISBN 0-470-02425-9).  Unfortunately, few tone-mapping  
algorithms actually pay much attention to preference with respect to  
color, and I know of at least two reasons why not:

1) People prefer increased gamma or saturation on their colors, which  
happens to correspond to less dynamic range in the reproduction -- in  
other words, boosting saturation makes it difficult to represent your  
larger luminance range.

2) Increasing saturation, or even leaving it alone, while compressing  
an image's dynamic range makes colors look *too* saturated in many  
images, because a loss in contrast is often read as haze by the human  
visual system, and your brain compensates by imagining the colors to  
be more saturated than they appear.

That said, you can of course play around with the gamma when you  
convert to 24-bit/pixel formats, and get a boost in contrast and  
saturation that way.  Sometimes the results will be nicer, oftentimes  
they will be worse.  To boost contrast/saturation, try:

	pcond capture.hdr | ra_tiff -g 1.6 - boosted.tif

To reduce contrast/saturation try:

	pcond capture.hdr | ra_tiff -g 2.7 - reduced.tif

There are more sophisticated ways to play around with contrast and  
saturation separately using pcomb, but I'm not sure you gain that  
much by them.

IMHO, HDRI may or may not require the color reproduction and  
saturation to be as accurate or appealing.  IIt seems to me that, in  
general, saturation and color issues are less important when using a  
HDRI for image-based lighting than when using the technique of  
converting a sequence of LDRI to a single HDRI for increased dynamic  
range in a tone-mapped photograph, where the final output will be an  
image of the scene as opposed to a light probe image for IBL.

Could hdrgen/Photosphere possibly benefit from more control over tone- 
mapping in a way similar to the CameraRaw presents options for  
exposing a RAW image?  If the use of HDRI for general photography  
(which I am really getting interested in, BTW) would other users find  
it useful to expand the ability of hdrgen/Photosphere to present the  
user more control over the tone mapping process?  This kind of  
discussion could probably fill a whole new forum, and I would be all  
for it, if it is not too much of a hassle.

Interesting as always!

Hi Kirk,

Peter is quick.  He has just set up a new mailing list, hdri@radiance- 
online.org, which I suggest you subscribe to and we will move the  
discussion there.

HDRI generation is a separate issue from tone-mapping, and although  
Photosphere attempts to do both, it only makes a weak effort in the  
tone-mapping department.  Hdrgen makes no effort to tone-map images,  
and it should not.  In fact, I don't recommend tone-mapping HDR  
images into HDR, but directly into the destination display's color  
space, as an HDR image should maintain it's scene-referred color  
space.  Some of these issues are discussed and spelled out on  
hdrsoft's excellent FAQ page:

	http://www.hdrsoft.com/resources/dri.html

Since you bring up RAW (also discussed by hdrsoft), I should mention  
that although it is tempting to shoot RAW in preparation for creating  
HDR images, I have found it not to be helpful in most cases.  The  
additional range/resolution obtained is modest, and the confusion

I'll make an announcement under a new topic about the HDRI mailing

Message-ID: <CB10DCB7-D3F2-4112-A0D2-684A47F917EE@biomechanicsinc.com>

So I've been following this raging debate over at the Maxwell Render  
forums regarding the physical accuracy of renderers and the specific  
problem of visualizing the following scenario, to the best of my  
understanding:

Architectural rendering folks want a renderer that can accurately  
depict sunlight, through glass into the interior of a space.  They  
want this interior lighting to be visualizable from the exterior of  
the space as if you were standing outside with your camera, looking  
through the window, into the interior of the space.

here are some quotes:

1.
- - - - - - -
No one has presented a proper sollution to this problem.
I?m referring to rendering an interior space seen from an outside  
view in sunlight, trough glass without cheating.

This is a milestome in 3d art!!
If the MR team feel confident to deliver this in due time ok!!
  - - - - - -

2.
  --  - - -
I assume you mean it would be a milestone for Maxwell? Every other  
renderer I've ever seen can handle this very easily.
  - - - - -

3.
  - - - - -
he key is that he said "without cheating".

No other renderers can do it in the physically correct way. They all  
make it up.
  - - - - -
etc.


Is this a difficult rendering scenario for RADIANCE or any other  
renderer or are these people missing something?  There are some  
seriously pissed off people in the Maxwell Render forums, especially  
a lot of architect types who seem to think that the beta releases of  
M-R should solve all of their problems. I was more curious about the  
ability of Radiance to handle this type of scenario versus M-R which  
claims to be a physically-based renderer.

Thoughts?

Let me also be very clear that, after reading the vituperous

I think part of that is due to 'the release'. I've got some friends who are into Maxwell, and apparently their first non-beta of the product, their '1.0' or whatever, was a real dog. Didn't work very well. Seeing that they got a bunch of people to buy the beta, with the promise of giving them the offical release when it came out, and then having the first offical release be so bad, well, I think it caused a lot of bad blood. Also I've heard that they keep making promises in regards to increasing the speed of Maxwell and such that aren't happening as quickly as everyone would like. So there's some crankyness there to begin with.

but yes, a big thanks to everyone here for Radiance! Open source, and still great after all these years...

Hi Kirk,

I think the challenge to rendering the interior of a building through  
a glass facade is exactly the same trouble you would have  
photographing it -- the reflections will tend to overwhelm the  
interior unless there is direct sun penetrating the space, something  
architects try to avoid.  Typically, an interior is less than 10% as  
bright as the exterior during daylight conditions, and this is  
(roughly) the amount of light reflected by standard glass.   
Therefore, the reflections are intermixing with the light from the  
interior, and it's difficult to see any details that aren't confused.

Things are made better if you can get just blue sky or something  
without detail in the reflection, or use a polarizing filter and  
shoot near the Brewster angle, where all the reflected light is of a  
particular polarization.  This would be a nice trick that Radiance  
(unfortunately) cannot do properly, as it lacks polarization in its  
simulation.  (Well, we had to cut back somewhere...)

Hi Kirk,

Can you imagine?:
"hey, how come my rendering is all splotchy? Radiance sucks!"
"no, you suck!"

The Maxwell forum likely suffers from a few immature folks stirring up 
trouble.  This afflicts most of the CG forums I've participated in 
unfortunately, save for the radiance-online lists.  The Radiance user 
base is a class act.  I've made many friends here, and learned a lot.  
As usual, I feel we all owe the biggest debt of gratitude to Greg Ward 
and Peter AB for this, but there are many many people who contribute in 
big ways to make this the resource what it is.

Hi Erico,

you should use RADIANCE 3.7, Patchlevel 2, which we have put also onto

Hi Erico,

you probably should use the current version of photon-mapping(4.3),
which is for the RADIANCE 3.7. Roland made this new version some weeks
ago.
I'm not sure, if this helps in your special case, but I never had such
problems with using photon-ports and I used it several times without any
problems (I always used the 3.28 version for RADIANCE 3.5). 

We are actually reorganizing our web-pages and unfortunately the English
(web)version is not available and the German version shows a bug in
direct linking. That's the reason, why I haven't posted it to the
community yet.

Anyhow, it is already on a Web-page for downloading. 
You can get it on:
http://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/german/fields/field6/mb4/index.html then
follow link on "Lichtsimulation", then "RADIANCE", then "p-map"

Good luck!

There are some pretty whiney folks over in the M-R forums, throwing  
around phrases like "class action lawsuit" and the like.  It appears  
that there are some (mostly) architectural people who are claiming  
that their business projects are being affected by the failure of  
Next Limit to release the newest beta version of their software.   
Personally, I would consider basing the welfare and completion of my  
business projects on beta software risky, to put it mildly.  Suffice  
it to say that a lot of the huffing and puffing seems to be  
projection of some people's frustration with their own lack of  
judgement.  I believe these people think they have the "right" to  
sound off because they paid $495 and don;t ever seem to get any  
answers as to when the next version will be out, etc.

And yes, Rob, i can very well imagine the dialog you posted below!   
There would be a whole thread dedicated to how Radiance sucks because  
of splotchiness and the fact that it doesn't make their coffee in the  
morning.

The fact the Radiance attracts the user community that it does is a  
testament to its creators and keepers.  Thanks folks.

Hi Kirk,

It is interesting to see some of these comments. I am not exactly clear 
on the problem that they are trying to solve though. But I think one 
thing to keep in mind is that a lot of people (architects, designers and 
the architectural rendering folks) have a lot of pre-conceived ideas 
about how light should behave and how a scene should appear. These 
preconceptions can lead to a lot of problems when it comes to evaluating 
or simulating physical performance.

About MR history and current situation (
http://www.maxwellrender.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=10185).
Well the whole thing started a while ago when the promised and sold the
certainty to get a finished software for a certain time (last September).
This did not happened (they are still speaking of final candidate version
RC0.5 and so on).
The software is not yet finished (it is not version 1.0).
Not yet implemented on all the platform where was supposed to run (on Mac is
still beta although they promised something in the next ?24? hours) and
doesn?t support all the plug-ins for 3d application that are indicated on
the web page.
This doesn?t sound so appealing to me as well and I would understand
somebody delusion about the matter.

Having said that, I also need to add that I requested (as other friends did)
details about the physical accuracy of the renderer.
I never got an answer.
Is it itself an answer?

PS these are my personal opinions.

Hi Giullio and others following this thread,

<RANT MODE>
It seems to me that this is a problem with proprietary shrink wrap 
software renderers. Who really knows what is going on under the hood, 
whose word should be taken for the validity of the physical model, what 
validations have occurred?!

Users see the product marketing materials that talk about Global 
Illumination and "physical accuracy," and they believe the hype! That 
seems to me to be pretty dangerous if you are going to be using the tool 
to somehow "validate" design issues!

I know that there are systems that have implemented GI to varying 
degrees and sophistication. But the problem is you probably have to be 
an uber expert to use them and/or code up custom material/lighting 
shaders. Still though the question is what validation has occurred. I 
think that most commercial renderers and users of said systems are 
really not that interested in physical validity, they are most 
interested in the outcome/appearance of the final image. It does not 
really matter how it get there.

It seems to me that the one commercial product that showed some hope in 
its original (pre-acquisition) form was Lightscape. However, Rob 
Guglielmetti has explored and written pretty extensively on this topic 
seemingly with only partial satisfaction (my apologies to Rob G. for 
such a cursory summary, he did some really excellent work on this). Note 
I also believe that the original developers of Lightscape were truly 
interested in enabling people to use a tool with a reasonable and 
practical level of physical validity.
</RANT MODE>

Best,

-Jack

Giulio and Jack,

I agree as well.  I do not think the M-R users are angry because the  
software is not quantitatively accurate enough for their liking, it  
is obvious that the users of M-R want photoreal renderings, not  
physically accurate, quantitative data.  The mob appears to be  
restless because of the unfulfilled promises that M-R appear to  
market - I think the users have various but specific 2nd or 3rd order  
desired effects for the renderer (caustics, sun behind glass or  
whatever) -  things they believe add photorealism to their renders  
(things that "look cool").  I don;t think they really care about or  
appreciate the quantitative physical accuracy of the solution, they  
just want all of the subtle physical phenomena to be present in their  
output.  Trying to mollify that kind of user amidst many other  
similar requests is almost impossible I would think, regardless of  
how M-R market their renderer.  Then multiply that by the number of  
platforms and 3rd party 3D modeler plug-ins they tout and you have a  
recipe for ... well what they have on the forum.

Man, that is an angry crowd on the forum though.

If anyone is interested, here is a thread that demonstrates the  
sunlight through glass "problem" that started this whole discussion.

Message-ID: <89bc75610601181003w81779c4gc1182e7c6e2661b0@mail.gmail.com>

I've just rendered my first successful Radiance picture with rad.

Now, I want to produce a contour line picture from falsecolor.

However, when I enter this into my command line:

        falsecolor -ip skeltest1_vw1.pic -cl > contourtest.pic

This is returned:

        csh: mkdir: Command not found.

And a file called contourtest.pic of size 0k is created in the
appropriate folder.

Can anyone help?

I'm running the August 05 versiton (3.7?) of Radiance on a G5 iMac
with MacOSX 10.4.0 using the standard X11 distribution that came with
the system.

Thanks!

Can I get an amen-ahh!

I got into it with a CAD/modeling pundit several years ago, when he 
stated in a review that Viz was capable of producing renderings that 
were "95% accurate".  What the hell does that mean?  Well, I asked him, 
and he said he spent a full day with Stu Feldman (one of the two 
founders of Lightscape), and that was what he walked away with.  I told 
him he didn't get his money's worth on the half-day seminar.  We went 
back and forth on this, I told him he was doing his readers a great 
disservice, and in the end I was made to feel like a loser for being in 
such a small industry that no one cares about.  Something about "if you 
want to stick with Lightscape, good luck, it's not going to be supported 
anymore, blah blah..."  The good news is, it forced me to finally learn 
Radiance.  =)  The problem is that that review went into Cadalyst 
magazine, which is read by lots of Architectural CAD drafters and 
renderers, and as you mention they aren't necessarily concerned with the 
goings on under the hood.  And then you have people showing renderings 
to clients and saying "oh yes, that's what it will look like, we used 
software that's 95% accurate!"  Which is amazing, since many of these 
people driving the program don't know how to read a polar curve on a 
luminaire cutsheet. Oops.

...and if the result looks nice in half the time, screw accuracy.  That 
was a lot of the complaining I saw on the M-R forums, was how slow it 
was.  It's comments like that that really give you insight into how 
little these people understand the problem of solving GI.

Thanks Jack.  I was merely trying understand the product's limitations 
because I wasn't ready to commit to learning radiance in production.  
=8-)  And you are right about the developers.  At least in the case of 
Rod Recker (the other Lightscape developer), I definitely felt like he 
was interested in giving the world a tool.  Sure, getting rich off it is 
a nice bonus, but he seemed to be interested in taking that Cornell 
education and channeling it into a lighting tool.  He's a really nice 
guy and wish him the best of luck at Autodesk.  It's truly unfortunate 
what happened to that product, but then again it was severely limited in 
what it could do.  Of course, who knows what it'd be like today had the 
right people stayed in the decision-making seat.  Then again, how far 
can one go with radiosity?  (Well, I guess the folks at Lighting 
Analysts can answer that one, and the answer is "pretty damned far".  
Their AGI product continues to improve, and with people like Martin at 
PSU doing validations with it, it becomes more and more robust.  But I 
still prefer Radiance.) 

Interesting thread; sorry for the somewhat off-topic verbiage, but I 
think we all learn from these exchanges too.

Hi Anthony,

There is a problem under OS X, which doesn't have a /usr/tmp  
directory.  This has been fixed in the latest release (I think), but  
maybe not the one you have.  The solution is to execute "sudo ln -s / 
var/tmp /usr" and enter the administrator's password.

There should have been a note about this spat out by makeall, but  
maybe you missed it.

Your csh tells you that it can't find the command "mkdir"
which should be in your /bin directory (here: OS X 10.4.4)
and is (hopefully) a sign for a wrong search path setting.

Please check which csh you are using and if you can find mkdir
from the command line. Type these commands:

which csh
which mkdir

Also check the output of

echo $PATH

You realy should fix this csh problem but here is a quick
workaround:

Create a new directory (with "Finder") or - if this works -
from the BASH prompt:

mkdir /tmp/falsecolor

And change the first line (after the comments) in falsecolor
(probably the file "/usr/local/bin/falsecolor"):

from:     set td=/tmp/fc$$
to:       set td=/tmp/falsecolor

and the last line:

from:     rm -rf $td
to:       rm -rf $td/*

You can only run one instance of falsecolor at a time now
but it will help until you found and fixed the real problem.

Just in case:

We have just completed a validation of 9 daylighting simulation
packages. This validation will be published in the reference book on
Lighting Engineering under the editorship of academician J.B.Aizenberg
and I can confirm that only Radiance and AGi32 provide correct
qualitative and quantitative results.

We've got 17.7% maximum relative difference with SuperLite 2 and
higher than 150% relative difference with Lightscape.

We wanted to test Inspirer from Integra Inc., Japan, because they
claim it provides phisycal accurate simulation results. But,
apparently, they didn't provide us with the package for evaluation.

Hi Giullio and others following this thread,

<RANT MODE>
It seems to me that this is a problem with proprietary shrink wrap software
renderers. Who really knows what is going on under the hood, whose word
should be taken for the validity of the physical model, what validations
have occurred?!

Users see the product marketing materials that talk about Global
Illumination and "physical accuracy," and they believe the hype! That seems
to me to be pretty dangerous if you are going to be using the tool to
somehow "validate" design issues!

I know that there are systems that have implemented GI to varying degrees
and sophistication. But the problem is you probably have to be an uber
expert to use them and/or code up custom material/lighting shaders. Still
though the question is what validation has occurred. I think that most
commercial renderers and users of said systems are really not that
interested in physical validity, they are most interested in the
outcome/appearance of the final image. It does not really matter how it get
there.

It seems to me that the one commercial product that showed some hope in its
original (pre-acquisition) form was Lightscape. However, Rob Guglielmetti
has explored and written pretty extensively on this topic seemingly with
only partial satisfaction (my apologies to Rob G. for such a cursory
summary, he did some really excellent work on this). Note I also believe
that the original developers of Lightscape were truly interested in enabling
people to use a tool with a reasonable and practical level of physical
validity.

The software is not yet finished (it is not version 1.0).
Not yet implemented on all the platform where was supposed to run (on Mac is

This doesn?t sound so appealing to me as well and I would understand

Having said that, I also need to add that I requested (as other friends did)

I never got an answer.
Is it itself an answer?

Hi Pierre-Felix,

You are too right money does talk and the needs of the clients that we 
all find tend to dictate the market. I have always found that a big 
challenge is customer education, educating the customer about what is 
possible, why and what the value-add is. With respect to talking about 
the pros and cons of specific technologies, I find it best to pick the 
appropriate place, project and client.

Regards,

-Jack de Valpine

PS, do you have any sense for what will happen to Maya/Max/Viz with the 
Autodesks acquisition of Alias?

Dear all:

I am trying to use Radiance on a super computer of 
our university. The super computer has 128 CPUs, 
and it should be very fast. But I found the rendering 
speed is almost the same as my notepad. A stuff of 
the super computer center tried to analysis the rendering 
process, and found out that most time was not taken by 
computation, but by outputing data to files. I think 
writing data to the .unf file must take a lot of time. 
Is there any way to solve this problem?  

Yours,
Huang

Huang,
 
Your calculation uses just one of these 128 CPUs, if you don't use the program rpiece. The amount or RAM is not really an issue. Check the man page for rpiece and ask your system administrator to help you set up a batch file for it.
 
Rview and rtrace are not parallized at this time, I believe.

Or did you have any resources that I can read more

As in life, mere size doesn't matter.

As Martin already said, you have to use the programm "rpiece" not
"rpict" to use more than one CPU. I don't remember the status of
"rpice" on SMP systems but I don't think it will scale up to 128
CPUs.

I tested the settings you give below and on my 2GHz PowerPC
("Core Solo") the daffodil test scene ran about 3 seconds.
If you have similar times on your system, saving image data
on a slow NFS system may indeed have an impact on your process.
But that's a problem of your NFS then, not of Radiance.

If you can set up a RAM disc on your nodes you could use that
to store the image computed on one node and copy the final
image to the shared storage space. But I don't think that's
possible on a managed cluster. (Perhaps there is a /tmp FS
local to each cluster node?) But you still have to share
your ambient data (in the day.amb file) across all nodes to
get the real benefit of multiple cpus.

Given your settings your need for render speed is _not_
render quality (pretty low). As well your image dimensions
are small. What are you trying to render in the end?
If it's an animation you could use "ranimate" to distribute
frame rendering to separate nodes explicitly.

You should share your ambient data (in the "day.amb" file)
between all nodes to get the benefit of multiple CPUs and to
avoid variations between frames or image parts. If this slows
down your system don't use the "-af day.amb" option and
rpict will use the memory during calculations (on each node
separately).

The image data is written to STDOUT by rpict. If you can
redirect to a local FS on each node you don't have to use NFS
all the time (like I said "/tmp" may be a local FS on each node).
Don't forget to copy the final image to your NFS area, though.
I use RAM discs when I have do create a lot of small files
for a short time only. Speed has not been a consideration,
only HD movements and noise.

Your settings for reference. You should provide information
about your rendering setup (which commands, control files)
and what you actually want to do (BIG image vs. animation vs.
high detail rendering) on the cluster, too.

Message-ID: <D6FF221D-D2DC-460A-A6D4-659F0C586632@dmu.ac.uk>

Dear Radiance aficionados,

The 2006 Radiance Workshop will be held at De Montfort University  
(Leicester, UK) sometime in September.

The Workshop will last two days and follow the same format as  
previous events.  We will try to keep prices much the same as before  
(i.e. in the region of US$200-250 for the registration, less for  
speakers).

To allow for some flexibility in planning, I have provisionally  
booked a room during both the first and third (full) weeks in  
September [1].  I will need to finalise the booking in the next week  
or two.  Please respond as soon as possible giving your preference.

Option A:   7-8 September (Thu-Fri)
Option B: 18-19 September (Mon-Tue)

It would greatly assist the organisers if firm bookings could be made  
sooner rather than later.  I will send more details once we have  
settled on a preferred date.  The tally stands at 1 for Option B (my  
preferred date).

I look forward to hearing from you -- soon.

-John

[1] Greg asked that I avoid the second week, so please don't ask for  
that.

hi

i've trying out rtcontrib on this, but whatever settings i use i seem to 
get just a black screen out. if i run rpict witht the same settings (ie 
the same view and opt files) i get a good picture (although obviously 
using all the lights).
does anyone have any suggestions what i might be doing wrong?

Hi Will,

Here are some ideas (although you probably know most already)

- make sure you have a recent head version
- make sure that the definitions of the materials are ok (if you want  
to separate 100 lights you need to define 100 light materials and use  
one material in each light)
- the actual names of the materials replace the "light1" "light2" in  
the example
- sometimes the image is too dark and you need to use "a" (for auto  
exposure) in ximage
- make sure the resolution is the same in both commands (I got this  
mistake)
- after "-fcc" is a backtick ` and the same after "best.vf" (in Unix  
this means "execute the command inside and return the result" or  
something like that)
- if you have too many lights, could be you don`t have enough  
descriptors, try the command "csh" (to enter cshell) and then "limit  
descriptors" (the result should be higher than the number of  
materials you want to define, but it`s probably more than 100)

just some ideas. it is probably none of the above. and it would  
surely help more information: what command you actually used, what  
result you get (any error message?) which OS, Radiance version, etc
HTH

Fist guess: 	Is the image realy black or just very,very dark?
		Remove all lights except "light1" and "light2"
		from the scene and check the rvu/rpict image.

Second guess: 	Do you have _materials_ in your scene that are
               	assocciated with lights and are the name those
               	you gave with the "-m" option?

For the example below the materials "light1" and "light2" should
be defined in your scene and used for i.e. a polygon or a sphere
("geometric primitives", first paragraph of the man page).

Dear Radiance users,

we are actually restructuring out Web-pages and we managed to put some 
RADIANCE tools on a page for download.
Unfortunately the English version of the new site will be launched only 
1-2 months from now.
In the meanwhile you can easily find and download there

    1. evalglare: A new tool for detecting glare sources and calculating 
glare indices, especially the new DGP (daylight glare probability)
    2. Photon-mapping, version 4.3: This version is for the RADIANCE 3.7P2
    3. gendaylit: Perez sky model

                                even if you can't understand the German.

Here is the site:

Subject: [Radiance-general] calculating correct illuminance from irradiance
Message-ID: <43D6716E.4040906@gmx.de>

Dear all,

i am new to Radiance and i went trough oodles of manual pages, R.w.R.- 
book, digest etc., but i couldn?t find an
answer to my question.
This is what i did:

1. I collected illuminance data for a *'Desisti' 1 KW* incandescent 
luminaire in our lighting laboratory.
2. I converted the illuminance values to luminance values and the color 
temperature of 3200K to RGB 1.377 0.913 0.351
-- I used the color temperatur conversion from the Radiance book p.431. 
I need to see the color temperature in the              pictures.
3. Finally i created an '.ies file' and used 'ies2rad' to get Radiance data.
-- Now i know, that instead i could have created  the' .dat ' file 
myself by dividing the luminance data by 179 lm/w --
4. I used 'rtrace' to measure my 'virtual' light source to verify my 
collected data
-- I used the same measuring distance as in the lab --
5.  My lamp ( source is a 'ring' ) is at 1 0 4 pointing downwards at 0 0 -1
6. at first i used 'rtrace' for the irradiance data:
*
       *echo "1 0 0 0 0 1" |rtrace -I -h lux_test.oct

/      4.154708e+01 2.754719e+01 1.059043e+01     
/*First question:  Are these irradiance values for RGB with the unit 
'w/square meter' ?*

7. now i measured the illuminance:


     $ echo '1 0 0 0 0 1' |rtrace -I -h  lux_test.oct |rcalc -e 
'$1=*47.4**$1+*120**$2+*11.6**$3'

         *5397.84338*  

-- this value is really satisfying, my collected data is *5400 lux!*

*Second question: Where do the factors of  *47.4/179 =* 0.26 , *120/179 
=* 0.67 and *11.6/179 =* 0.065 come from?

*I only know the standard factors from video for the EBU - Phosphors. 
There the luma value is: Y = 0.299*R+0.587*G+0.114*B
I tried these ones, but the result worse, in fact it is *5334 lux*.

Maybe someone can help me.

Best regards,

Christian

Hi Christian,

Thanks for reading through the documentation.  I know it can be a  
frustrating exercise, trying to find what you're looking for in the  
many, widely dispersed sources available.  It looks like you did a  
thorough job.

Yes, sort of.  If your scene consisted of purely gray surfaces with  
no radiation outside the visible wavelength limits, then the numbers  
would correspond to watts/meter^2 exactly.  However, the real world  
has stuff going on in UV and IR wavelengths (and beyond), and these  
should be included in a true measure of radiant flux.

More technically, the values used in Radiance (by convention)  
correspond to a transformation of the CIE XYZ coordinates to an RGB  
color space, with a conversion factor of 179 lumens/watt to make a  
vague correspondence to radiometric units with the above  
assumptions.  So long as the same conversion is applied in reverse  
when getting back to photometric quantities, all is well.  The exact  
color transform used is your next question.

The RGB color space used in Radiance is defined by the following  
constants, defined in ray/src/common/color.h:

#define  CIE_x_r                0.640           /* nominal CRT  
primaries */
#define  CIE_y_r                0.330
#define  CIE_x_g                0.290
#define  CIE_y_g                0.600
#define  CIE_x_b                0.150
#define  CIE_y_b                0.060
#define  CIE_x_w                0.3333          /* use true white */
#define  CIE_y_w                0.3333

These same constants are defined in ray/src/cal/cal/xyz_rgb.cal for  
convenient conversion between XYZ and RGB coordinates.  The Y(R,G,B)  
function from this file reduces to:

Y(R,G,B) = 0.26510582*R + 0.67010582*G + 0.0647883598*B;

which is basically the same as what you have above.  Except for the  
difference in the green channel chromaticities and the white point,  
these primaries are in fact the same as used for the standard sRGB  
color space.  If it wouldn't have thrown everything off slightly with  
little benefit, I might have switched to the sRGB primaries in  
Radiance when this standard came out.

In fact, the color primaries in Radiance can be whatever you choose  
them to be.  As I said, this is all by convention, and the actual  
calculation only converts from RGB to luminance to determine whether  
or not to truncate the ray tree with the -lw option.  Since this is  
really a minor effect, it actually doesn't matter what color space  
you render in, and if you want to know how Radiance may be used to  
obtain more accurate color results, consult the following paper:

	http://www.anyhere.com/gward/papers/egwr02/

I hope this helps.

This is not a Radiance-specific post, but an interesting little app  
that I came across - as a lot of us model things in 3D, I thought the  
PC (XP to be exact) users among us might give it a whirl and let us  
Mac users know how cool this is.

http://ogle.eyebeamresearch.org/

The app logs the 3D data passed through the OpenGL DLL and "captures"  
the 3D data, essentially creating a 3D screen grab of any OpenGL 3D  
object you may come across.  It appears that you can then import the  
object into a 3D app like Maya and proceed as usual.

Hello all,
I've been lurking for some time, trying to keep up on the developments in
both Radiance and HDRI.

In any case, to post something that MAY be of interest to others...
This is probably old news, but just in case, I have successfully replaced
the Radiance binaries that are installed with Desktop Radiance with the
updated ones (version 3R7P1, I believe) that Francesco compiled back in
October. I have been using the Radiance Control Panel (part of EcoTect) as
the GUI front end to Radiance, and so far, everything seems to work
smoothly.

These are the steps I took:
1. I copied the contents of each folder (bin, lib, obj, doc, and runs) from
the Mingwin binaries that Francesco compiled into the corresponding folder
in C:\Radiance. This allowed me to replace any updated binaries, while
keeping the older binaries of programs that were not compiled (ie. Anything
that requires xwindows)
2. I copied RadianceIV (the image viewer that comes as part of EcoTect) into
C:\Radiance, and then renamed it winimage (the name of the image viewer that
is installed as part of Desktop Radiance)

I have by no means tested this installation to see if all programs work, but
so far with the basic renderings I have run, I have had no problems
whatsoever. Also, because RadianceIV can post-process images, I have been
producing falsecolor images as well as contour line images directly from
RadianceIV (aka winimage).

So, for those who, for one reason or another, can only work in the Window$
environment, these binaries completely revamp Desktop Radiance.

Francesco, Greg, Lars, or John, would it be possible to maintain updated
Window$ binaries so that those of use stuck using Window$ can at least
benefit from the latest developments and fixed in the Radiance binaries?

Hi,
 
Does somebody hace a really nice Radiance model of a chair? Le Corbusier or Mies van der Rohe etc?
 
Thanks

Hi, 
 
Please check www.personal.psu.edu/mum13/room
 
and take a look at the jpegs. What is going on with chair5.jpg? It should look like chair4.jpg. Only the view is different - it is from the back of the room towards the window. Rad files are included. The material of the window is trans. Illum / mkillum is used.

Greg and Thomas,
Thanks!  I made the link Greg suggested and I dug through my
csh-related files until I found the csh.login file where I included
the radiance paths and now falsecolor works very well from the
Terminal.  It doesn't work at all in the X11 xterm, but I think this
is a minor trouble right now.

Message-ID: <89bc75610601261715n12ab73fds451b59a91abfe69d@mail.gmail.com>

Good Evening,

I'm an archaeologist using Radiance to do some daylight modeling in
medieval churches.  I would like to include period-correct stained
glass in the windows (in this case 13th century grisaille).  However,
I have no idea where to find information on the transmittance index
and other properties of stained glass.

Has anyone modelled something like this before?

Can anyone point me toward a resource that might have details on the
properties of stained and/or historic glass?

Thanks for your help.

I agree, nice resource...

I ordered a CDROM myself :)

Once upon a time i had a cdrom from a 'parts' vendor, that offered all their 
products in DXF format, so you could order the right part. ( screws, pipe, 
fittings.. etc )

Left the CD behind when i left the job, damned if i can remember who they 
were. Having a 'standard library' again would be great.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Trans material and photon map
Message-ID: <000601c622e5$92114ba0$0201a8c0@design.harvard.edu>

Hi folks,
 
I have built a scene where a 5.6m tall cylinder is piping sunlight
(solar altitude: 80) inside a 5-meter radius sphere (bubble). The tube's
origin is in the center of the sphere and it ends at the top of the
sphere. I have set the rtrace measurement points inside the sphere at
every 10 degrees (180 total), so I can transform that in an IES file
later on. The rtrace (and rpict) of the photon-mapping is running fine
showing the specular reflection on the bottom of the sphere.
 
As a next step, I added a "diffuser" at the origin of the cylinder,
inside the sphere, using a "trans" material for an isotropic
distribution. The readings I get now show the same illuminance value for
every measurement point. This is the script:
 
oconv sky.rad scene.rad ports.rad > pipe80.oct


oconv -i pipe80.oct > i_pipe80.oct


mkpmap -app pipe80.gpm 1000000 100 -t 60 -apc pipe80.cpm 1000000 -apO
./ports i_pipe80.oct

rtrace -w -h -I -ab 1 -ad 16384 -aa 0.01 -ar 512 -app pipe80.gpm -apc
pipe80.cpm 100 -e errors.rad i_pipe80.oct < points.inp | rcalc -f
rcalc.rad > data.dat


The total luminous flux reaching the diffuser is bouncing from the
cylinder. Is it a problem between the parameters and "trans", with the
pmap and "trans" or something else?

Hi Erico,

did you erase the p-map files(pipe80.gpm,pipe80.cpm) between the two 
variants(with and without the diffusor)?

If not, you used the same photon distribution for both cases and 
therefore end up with the same illuminance values.

If you erased the files, what are the parameters for trans you used?

Hi Mark,
   
  Those images are so kewl!  Amazing.  But, they just whet my appetite for more information.  What is the polygon count?  Rendering time?  Size of .amb file?  Origin of software used to generate the model?  Any more?
   
  And, what is the link to your benchmark web site again?

Thanks - it was a display problem. I should have known that if there appears to be a problem with Radiance, check the hardware first, then the OS, last Radiance :)

Hi Martin,

It looks to me like your JPEG is corrupted.  What happens if you 
regenerate it, or write it out from Photosphere?

Mark,
 
This is really beautiful. How did you create "Dynamo"?

Radiance users,

In this, the final day before the SIGGRAPH Art Gallery deadline,
I would like to share with whomever is interested some of the
pieces that I will be submitting. They were all created in
Radiance (duh) and have been scaled down 5:1 or 6:1. I hope this
counts as "giving back" to the Radiance community in some way.

In other news, I have finally updated my Benchmark page with
results that were given to me up to 4 months ago. I welcome any
new contributions you may have. Parallel results may have to
wait, as there are unresolved timing issues with the Linux
platform.

Thanks!

Gang,

Here are some details on the geometry and rendering parameters, 
in case you are interested.


"Open House"
http://mark.technolope.org/transfer/img04_2400.jpg

My research software (http://mark.technolope.org/research/) made 
the general shape, it tracks vortex sheet motion with an adaptive 
triangular mesh; the time step used has 39467 tris.
A new tool in my Rocktools package 
(http://mark.technolope.org/rocktools/) called "rockmarker" 
(insipred by replmarks) placed 2 open-topped cubes for each 
triangle (20 new tris over each tri in the above mesh).
I added gensky sunlight and an orange-colored sky distribution 
via my old (and inaccurate) "skycolor.cal" model.
I put both the mesh and the boxes into the scene.
oconv -n 12 scene03.rad mark_0019_b.rad > scene03.oct (took up 
7-800 MB in RAM nonetheless)
rpict -vta -vh 18.75 -vv 18.75 @vp_flat3 -ds 0.1 -dj 0.7 -ab 3 
-aa 0 -ad 8 -as 0 -u -ps 1 -x 7200 -y 7200 -t 600 -z img04.zbf 
-o img04.pic scene03.oct 
(renders in 200 MB RAM, though)
rpict: 1249498744 rays, 100.00% after 25.675u 0.110s 27.581r 
hours on bacchus (Athlon XP 2000+, radiance 3.8a Jan 22)
ra_tiff -e -3.5 img04.pic img04.tif
Gimp: Gaussian IIR 3 pixel, reduce 3:1, sharpen 30
The final render will be at 36000x36000, reduced to 7200x7200 for 
printing at 24"x24", it will take about a month on one Athlon. I 
have two Athlons working on it right now.


"Boil"
http://mark.technolope.org/transfer/img05_1800.jpg

Same software to make the mesh, even same simulation type 
(Rayleigh-Taylor instability), this time 1106058 tris.
The mesh was smoothed and normals created with another one of the 
programs in my "rocktools" package:
rocksmooth vort_geom_0015.obj -s -n -oobj > geom0015.obj
obj2mesh geom0015.obj > geom0015.msh
The scene is simply a closed black cube with the mesh at the 
halfway point, the view above it, and the whole floor is a glow 
object.
oconv scene11.rad > scene11.oct
rpict -vtl @vp1 -ds 0.08 -ab 2 -aa 0 -as 0 -ad 8 -lr 20 -lw 0.001 
-ps 1 -x 7200 -y 7200 -t 600 -o img05.pic scene11.oct
(the rpict "-u" option wasn't created yet, so I compiled with 
-DMC)
rpict: 3253638522 rays, 100.00% after 29.674u 0.111s 31.193r 
hours on zeus (Athlon XP 2500+, ray count flipped 4.2G once)
pfilt -1 -e -3 -x /4 -y /4 -r 0.5 img05.pic | ra_ppm | cjpeg -q 
90 > img05_2400.jpg


"Dynamo"
http://mark.technolope.org/transfer/img31_2400.jpg

A different code made the geometry here. I wrote most of it for 
my job/post-doc for a small company in California. Instead of 
vortex sheets (my research), this code tracks the motion of 
vortex blobs/particles. In this case, the flow was confined to 
stay within a sphere. The snakes in the image are all 
streamlines, traced along the local velocity at a fixed point in 
time. There are 170909 spheres and probably just a few more 
cylinders/cones in total.
The ball is in a square and tall room which is mostly white. A 
warm-colored area light is near the top, the floor is red, and 
another light is inside of the ball.
The oconv must have taken up all 950 MB available on my best 
machine. If I had more RAM, I'd make bigger stuff.
It was rendered in two parts:
rpict -vtl @vp30 -ds 0.1 -dj 0.7 -ab 3 -aa 0 -ad 4 -as 0 -ps 1 -u 
-t 600 -x 14400 -vl -0.5 -vv 0.625 -y 7200 -o img31_1.pic scene30.oct
rpict: 2495232691 rays, 100.00% after 31.838u 0.133s 32.122r 
hours on bacchus (flipped once, took 400 MB in RAM)
The other one (-vl 0.5 -o img31_2.pic):
rpict: 2798392870 rays, 100.00% after 22.147u 0.001s 22.196r 
hours on zeus (flipped once)
pcompos -a 1 img31_?.pic > img31.pic
ra_tiff -e -1.75 img31.pic img31.tif
gimp it down to 2400^2 to make img31_2400.tif
I used Gimp for resizing because the "-aa 0 -ad 4" action creates 
some very hot pixels, and I can't seem to get pfilt to lose the
light---it always bleeds into surrounding pixels. So, I drop the 
pic to 8-bit, and smooth and resize in The Gimp.


Finally, the URL for my Radiance benchmark page is
http://mark.technolope.org/pages/rad_bench.html

Thanks!

Mark

Hi Jan,
 
When I say "same measurements" for every point, I meant that I have the
same number (around 140 lux) for every point.
Since rtrace is running fast, I actually make new octrees, and photon
distribution files for every round (new file names) so I don't mix
things up and keep track of the changes. Rtrace - without the diffuser
and the same parameters from the first message - returned (by degree):

20 > 8.90784897
30 > 6.83318662

100 > 1893.626 (hot spot)
110 > 18.7999635
120 > ...
 
That's about what I expected. Then I ran another (new) rtrace with the
diffuser/trans material below (I tried to keep it simple) and rtrace
returned the 140 lux for every point mentioned above:
 
void trans mat_dif
0
0
7 1 1 1 0 0.8 0
 
So, my guess is that trans is scattering light evenly inside the sphere,
which is odd since the diffuser is pointing down.

I ran evalglare and found a VCP of 307 and a UGR of 26. According to p. 3-31 in the IESNA handbook, a UGR of 26 corresponds to a VCP of <=40. 
 
VCP = Visual Comfort Probability = bound between 0 and 100%. Can you please check your VCP calculation/algorithm?
 
Thanks

Hi folks,

I'm trying to do some simple tests within Radiance of material

good explanation of the BRTDFunc and how one goes about structuring

Hi Martin,

oh yes, there seems to be an error in the calculation of the VCP.
I have to admid, that I have used evalglare only for daylight situations 
yet. So I've used only DGI, CGI and DGP yet, although I've implemented 
other indicees, too.
As soon as I return from my ski holidays (in about a week), I'll check that.

hi all
so i managed to get rtcontrib to produce me a picture - it turned out to 
be a combination of the suggestions people wrote, but noteably the need 
to adjust the exposure.
however the image that i'm producing has terrible jagged edges to the 
lit area. (i'm using the spotlight primitive, with penumbras turned off 
- so i should get a clean, sharp pool of light on the wall.)
it looks to me much worse than aliassing, but i dont know whether thats 
true.
i have tried pfilt on the .pic file, reducing the size and adding a 
little gaussian blur, but that doesnt fix the problem.

does anyone have any suggestions?
here is my opt file for the rendering settings:
-dp 2048
-ar 64
-ms 0.13
-ds .2
-dt .05
-dc .75
-dr 3
-sj 1
-st .01
-ab 3
-af theatre.amb
-aa .125
-ad 512
-as 64
-av 0.062 0.062 0.062
-lr 12
-lw .0005
-av 0 0 0
-ad 500
-ab 10
-aa 0.01

and i'll happilly email anyone the .pic produced. (im assuming i cant 
put attachments on this list.)

while i'm writing, im a bit confused by the exposure settings for pfilt, 
perhaps someone could shed some light on that for me. i seem to be able 
to run:
pfilt -e 1 image.pic, and get a very  bright image back, when i cant see 
anything but black in the original. - i thought that -e 1 would mean 
multiply by 1, so no change, is that wrong?

thanks for your help.
will

Hi Will,

You are correct that attachment sizes are limited on the mailing  
list, and people usually post JPEG images on a website somewhere when  
they want to share, if they have the option.

Please do send me your .pic file, so I can see what you're talking  
about.

Regarding pfilt, unless you use the -1 option, pfilt makes two passes  
on the file and applies and automatic scaling factor, which the -e  
option can modify.  This should be explained in the man page, which  
comes with the distribution or may be found on the Radiance website at:

Hi Kirk,

Probably the simplest example using the BRTDfunc type is the  
glaze.csh script output and its associated glaze1.cal and glaze2.cal  
auxiliary files.  These may be found in the ray/src/gen directory of  
the latest Radiance distribution.  If this is not enough for you, you  
can look at the attached He.cal file for ideas.

It might be possible to make use of the Curet database, but no one  
has done it yet with Radiance, as far as I know.  You would probably  
want to apply the plasdata or transdata primitives, rather than  
BRTDfunc, which is awkward to use with a large dataset directly.

I'm sorry I don't have any better examples of BRDF use, but the  
common method is to fit the data to one of the Gaussian distribution  
models, which offer more complete and efficient ray interactions.   
Specifically, the BRDF types do not account for indirect specular  
components, though I believe there is some support for this in the  
photon map extension.

At the 2005 Eurographics Symposium on Rendering, Addy Ngan presented  
the following paper:

Experimental Analysis of BRDF Models
Addy Ngan, Fr?do Durand, and Wojciech Matusik

which is online at:

	http://people.csail.mit.edu/addy/research/brdf/

The "supplemental document" linked above contains a very nice list of  
BRDF materials and their fits to the "Ward model," which is used in  
Radiance.  If you are applying this to a recent version of Radiance  
(3.6 or later), then you'll actually want to use the coefficients for  
the "Ward-Duer model," as it includes the correction to the  
normalization of my original model, pointed out by Arne Duer of the  
Univ. of Innsbruck (and also Don Walters of Boeing Corporation).   
Unfortunately, Ngan et al. only cover isotropic materials in this  
document.  They did measure a couple of anisotropic materials, and I  
have further information on those, but there isn't really enough and  
the fit wasn't good enough to make them worth using in Radiance.

I hope this helps.
-Greg

Hi Will,

The reason you are seeing jagged edges to your spot is because the  
default "direct jitter" or "-dj" setting for rtcontrib is 0.5.  (You  
may discover all the default values by typing "rtcontrib - 
defaults".)  For spotlight's, the edges can be particularly strong,  
and I don't generally recommend this type unless you couple it with a  
light output distribution and set the cut-off past the natural cut- 
off of the fixture -- unless of course you are simply going for an  
artistic effect.

The -u+ option is recommended for rtcontrib, particularly when you  
are using it to render images, because the correlations between  
values will show up in odd ways on a 2-D image that would not be  
noticeable in a 1-D sample sequence.  This is why your original  
rendering looks so odd.

As for the -e option of pfilt, it is used as an additional multiplier  
if auto-exposure is employed with the default -2 (pass) operation, so  
it is not completely overridden.

-Greg

Greg
Thanks for your help. I will play with the -dj settings to get a better 
picture.

as for the spotlight type light, i am still at the "pretty basic" stage 
with my model - i will hopefully use real lighting fixture specs to 
model real instruments in the not too distant future! having said that, 
i dont really follow waht you mean by "set the cut-off past the natural 
cut- off of the fixture". could you explain a bit more please.

thanks once again
will

Hi Will,

The spotlight type is designed to make the calculation more efficient  
by avoiding testing for light sources that don't stand to make a  
contribution.  If you used the regular "light" type with a narrow  
spot fixture, it would check for source visibility at all angles,  
only finding out the contribution was zero afterwards.  Using the  
spotlight source, you can preempt this test for angles past the  
normal cut-off of the fixture.

This is less important since the introduction of adaptive shadow ray  
testing way back in 1991, but it was left in there for legacy reasons  
and because the code is handy for the virtual light source handling,  
anyway.  (Long story.)

Greg just pointed out that the spotlight is an unnatural light
source with an unrealistically sharp edge you won't find in any
physical fixture. So you should not use a spotlight if you want
to create a downlight in your scene and get realistic results.

You can modify the output distribution (and with this the "edge"
of the beam) of a spotlight with measured data and get a better
representation of a real world fixture. But you have to use a
spotlight angle that exceeds the angle of the fixture the data
was taken from or anything beyond the angle of the spotlight
will just be black.

Example: If your data shows a beam angle of 30 deg for the
fixture use an angle of more than 30 deg for the spotlight (add
5 or 10 deg to be sure you won't cut of small amounts of light
at the rim).

What's the best way to get a sky with a cloud texture map in Radiance 
(assuming
the cloud texture map is already "sphericized")?  I've tried applying a 
COLORPICT pattern onto
the sky SOURCE  but it doesn't work (I get black).  I assume this is 
because the UV
coordinates aren't available in the same way (with Lu, Lv) that works 
with mesh objects.

I've also tried making a polygonal mesh sky dome. That's easily textured 
but creates other problems
(shadows and other lighting effects on the sky) .

Thanks for any help or guidance on how to do this sort of thing!

This is a quick way:

void colorpict dist
echo 11 noop noop noop image.pic fisheye.cal fish_u fish_v -rx 90 -rz 90
0
0

dist glow skyglow
0
0                  
4 1 1 1 0          

skyglow source sky
0
0                  
4 0 0 1 180


Hope it works/helps :-)
Ciao
G.

Hi Bob,

You need to use a mapping that indexes off the ray directions rather  
than locations, which are meaningless for sources (as you  
discovered).  The fisheye.cal file included in the ray/lib directory  
should be a good starting point:

{
         Calculate coordinates for a 180 degree fisheye lens.
         Assume view direction is (0,1,0), view up (0,0,1), (1,0,0)  
right.

         4/30/90
}

fish_u = .5 + Dx/fish_Rxz * fish_Ry;
fish_v = .5 + Dz/fish_Rxz * fish_Ry;

fish_Rxz = sqrt(Dx*Dx + Dz*Dz);
fish_Ry = Acos(Dy) / PI;

----------
You may need to apply a rotation to this if your z-axis points up, as  
is usually the case.  Something like:

void colorpict cloud_pat
9 red green blue clouds.pic fisheye.cal fish_u fish_v -rx 90
0
0

cloud_pat brightfunc skyfunc
2 skybr skybright.cal
0
7 1 3.58e+01 3.07e+01 1.55e+00 0.054270 -0.269929 0.961350

-------
In this example, I have added your cloud pattern to a sky created by  
gensky.  If you have an HDR image of the sky you're working from, you  
may just be able to go with that.

Thanks a lot (and to Guilio too).  This is a great help!
