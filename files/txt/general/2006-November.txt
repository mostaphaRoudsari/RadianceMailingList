...has been broken!

That's right, people.  One of the beloved render farm machines at my 
office just turned in a sub-4K second timing on the Mark Stock Radiance 
benchmark scene.  SSSssssssss!

What's interesting to note is that there are subtle differences in cpu 
speed, even among the same cpu model.  I assume this is due to different 
voltage settings on the motherboards, but I'm not positive.  I also 
wonder how much of the speedup is attributable to the use of the new 
official release of Radiance 3.8.  Another interesting thing is that 
three of four benchmarks had the same exact number of rays traced.  I 
find this a little odd. 

I was hoping Greg and maybe Ferdinand (builder and maintainer of my 
office's render farm systems) could weigh in on this.  I have a couple 
other benchmark timings and stats to add to the site 
(http://mark.technolope.org/pages/rad_bench.html) as well, I was hoping 
others have installed the official 3.8 and were doing similar testing.

Happy benchmarking.

I did 3857.2 last week when testing my 3.8 Blastwave packages.  That
with "only" a 2193 Mhz chip.  Must send the results off.

Solaris 10.  Sun Studio 11 compiler.  Opteron@2193MHz.
Generic package with isaexec arch parts.  This still shows 3.7.2 but
see:

3.8 is slightly faster but I didn't spend long comparing.  I did a
test because I wanted to understand if the improvement on my previous
score was due to 3.8 or my newer compiler.  The answer is the Sun
Studio 11 compiler is much better.

I haven't benchmarked the "official 3.8" binaries on the G5, G4, or  
Intel as yet, but I should get around to that and post the results.   
I don't know what I might have done, offhand, to improve the  
performance over last year's entries.

Yes, the angle of the holes would matter.  I had assumed they were  
perpendicular to the material face, but as I said, I know nothing  
about this device.

Hi Greg,

I've checked plone. I am not convinced that this will encourage people 
to work on the documentation. I haven't seen convincing running examples 
yet - maybe others have ?

Concerning Wikipedia:

Please have a look at  http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki.

This is a free software distribution which requires only MySQL, Apache 
and PHP to run.

When this wiki software is installed on a server, it /is/ a controlled 
environment. Most important feature imho is that only registered users 
can edit articles.

What kind of funding is required ? A webserver ?

Message-ID: <FE872D9C4591BF44AAFD986BF73368FF092747@webmail.transsolar.com>

Hi all,
I agree, but my simulation should give results for LEED minimal requirements. There it is only one defined sky (midday, equinox, clear sky) and a minimum average illuminance in the room behind the facade (+ turnable but not moveable lamellas) is required.
The lamellas I've to simulate are not the perforated mini blinds, but get  a dimensions of 0.5 meter width and a length of about 3 meters.
The surface is brushes aluminum (adapted for redirect the daylight into the room). 
With this starting position, I need a material definition which reflect the daylight (direct and diffuse)  at  85% of lamella area and, on account of the 15% of gaps in the lamellas, a light transmission of 15%.
Does anybody have an idea?
 
Thanks
Friedemann

 Friedemann,
 
I assume you only try to approximate the effect on the shadowing
of the room, then, not modelling the real reflectance of the material.
 
You could start with your base material (aluminium - see the example
materials in the distribution) and add a mixfunc with void as second
modifier. Thus the areas defined in the function file should simply
be transparent like a hole in the material. 
 
There was a function file that created a dot pattern by Georg
Mischler; I just can't remember the name now. You have to specify
the right dimmensions of the dots for your 85/15 ratio. I think
you could apply a scale to it so that it created oval dots instead of
circles (but that might have been a different function file). 
 
hth,
Thomas

Hi Iebele,

We tried a Wiki for Radiance already and it didn't go anywhere, and  
was inundated by adware.  I don't really blame Wiki for this -- the  
problem was more lack of groundswell and necessary controls, which  
I'm sure we could remedy if we were a little more organized.

I am not versed on the merits of or differences between Plone and  
Wiki, and I know very little about either.  Both Peter Apian- 
Bennewitz and Daniel Fuller (the sysadmin for LBL's website) say  
Plone is better, but you would have to ask them for details.  I'm  
willing to trust others' judgement on the matter, as I have no  
expertise in the area of web management.  I can make some simple  
HTML, and that's about it.

The important thing is that we agree to contribute material, and the  
site administrator should be happy and/or paid for their efforts,  
which I suspect would be substantial using either system.  In other  
words, setting up a Wiki site may be easy, but protecting it from  
adware while developing useful content may in fact be easier with  
Plone.  I leave the debate to others.

-Greg

Hello all,

I recently deployed MediaWiki for use at work and the way we set it up 
was that a) you must be logged in to edit anything and b) certain people 
or groups of people we're placed in charge of different sections on the 
Wiki, meaning that they were the only ones who could directly contribute 
to that particular page (individual users can protect pages with a 
separate password that will allow only them to edit it). However, we 
also set up a "drafts" page which was linked from the main page that was 
essentially a mirror of each page. Anyone logged in could edit and add 
to this draft page and every once in awhile the person(s) in charge of 
the section will go through the draft and add things that are relevant 
and correct to the main page. This helps us make sure that there is 
limited spamming (and NO spamming on the main pages) and it helps us 
ensure the accuracy and helpfulness of items within the wiki. I'm not 
familiar with Plone, but I would imagine a similar setup could be 
arranged with that as well.

Granted, this does not solve the issue of actually convincing people to 
contribute to such a setup, but something like this would help 
significantly with quality control and making sure that little or no 
spam makes its way to the wiki.

In-Reply-To: <BAY0-MC9-F110J6gxyA003b0f08@bay0-mc9-f11.bay0.hotmail.com>
Message-ID: <BAY115-F122C173D2459B7D565D1C4A4FD0@phx.gbl>

Dear Group,

I have a question concerning anisotropic roughness vector alignment. 
Specifically I would like to know is there anyway to correlate the u and v 
mapping values to a desired roughness vector. Here is an example what I am 
attempting to simulate (see photo below)

http://i35.photobucket.com/albums/d178/marcdevon/100_0050.jpg

You can see how the brush strokes follow the base of the clock 
circumferentially. Ideally, if one were to model the same object, one 
roughness vector value would align itself around the clock base. The other 
value would be in the radial direction. For an object such as this, I can 
model the object such that the image map will align around itself in a 
similar manner (see image below):

http://i35.photobucket.com/albums/d178/marcdevon/ring01_render.jpg

Since I can align a texture in the direction that I want, I was wondering if 
there is I can translate the uv coordinates in a manner that could be used 
for specifying the anisotropic roughness values.

Please let me know if I do not make sense. Sometimes I have been known to 
confuse myself :>)

Thanks,

Marcus

Hi Marcus,

A radial anisotropy is one of the easiest types to generate.  The  
values for the vector [ux uy uz] are variables for a reason.  These  
can be set to [(Px-xcent) (Py-ycent) 0] for a clock face in the x-y  
plane, which may be rotated and moved wherever you like afterwards.   
To make things even simpler, we can assume [xcent ycent] == [0 0] and  
use:

void metal2 brushed_around
4 Px Py 0 .
0
6 .5 .5 .5 .9 .03 .12

brushed_around ring shiny_face
0
0
8
	0	0	0
	0	0	1
	0	2

Using xform, you can then move the surface into position.

Hi,

once more the documentation thread, seams that Greg wants us to get 
something done before the end of the year ;-)

It is possible to enforce authentication in Wikis, while I doubt that 
ideas like access rights, user management and publishing workflow are 
Wikis' strengths. One the other hand, many of us are familiar with 
wiki-syntax, and if the idea is to get a platform where everyone can 
just start entering his ressources, this may be a solution. Actually, we 
already had such a Wiki for some time in the past, and Schorsch is 
maintaining a very useful lighting-wiki:

http://lightingwiki.com/FrontPage

I opted for a more (pre-)structured system, more in a classical content 
management way, with users, authors and editors, and with the 
possibility to generate offline-documentation. I have a 
demo-installation up and running at

http://radiance.free-architecture.org

The installation is based on Drupal (www.drupal.org) and allows 
authenticated users to create and edit content, while this has to be 
approved by editor users before being published. Drupal allows not only 
pdf-export, but also ex- and import of chapters of its 
"book"-document-type, allowing offline editing. For Radiance, I would 
like to enable two more features, cvs-access integrated in the content 
management (which would require to have the Drupal set-up and the 
cvs-repository on the same machine) and Tex-input, because Radiance 
documentation (and useage ;-) relies a lot on maths... For Tex, I would 
have to extend the space I rent from my provider a bit, and I would do 
so if I knew that there is interest in this.

Besides, there is a third option, a directory linking to external 
ressources, as Axel's webring project, which was an advanced 
keyword-based system.

Anyway, I just wanted to offer again others here to play around with the 
installation and also to maintain it for some time (I mean more then a 
year), given that there are one or two willing to do some editor-work 
like approving new registrations, reviewing the articles / contributions 
etc. If there is a decision for another kind of documentation, I will 
stop these efforts and try to contribute there. Anyway, I think we 
should take this decision in the not too far future, as all those small 
documentation projects eat up our time and ressources, and cause a lot 
of frustration if there is no visible success and acceptance.

BTW, IMHO we face not a technical or financial problem - we have to 
motivate people to spend their spare time on a project where they have 
to work together for free and not only for some weeks. That is why we 
have so many small projects and few working examples of large maintained 
sites...

CU and have a nice week-end!

Lars.

Greg,

 

We can try MOODLE, it's a PHP aplication, with very nice features like wiki,
f?rum, chat, etc.

 

I have used this for two years in my classes in Universidade de Brasilia
(Brazil)

 

It's possible to control the login and administration is very easy.

 

 

"Moodle is a course management system (CMS) - a free, Open Source software
package designed using sound pedagogical principles, to help educators
create effective online learning communities. You can download and use it on
any computer you have handy (including webhosts), yet it can scale from a
single-teacher site to a 50,000-student University. This site itself is
created using Moodle, so check out the Moodle Demonstration Courses or read
the latest Moodle Buzz."

 

Please, look at 

 

http://moodle.org/

 

Nice to hear from you

 

vangelis

 

 

We tried a Wiki for Radiance already and it didn't go anywhere, and  

was inundated by adware.  I don't really blame Wiki for this -- the  

problem was more lack of groundswell and necessary controls, which  

I'm sure we could remedy if we were a little more organized.

 

I am not versed on the merits of or differences between Plone and  

Wiki, and I know very little about either.  Both Peter Apian- 

Bennewitz and Daniel Fuller (the sysadmin for LBL's website) say  

Plone is better, but you would have to ask them for details.  I'm  

willing to trust others' judgement on the matter, as I have no  

expertise in the area of web management.  I can make some simple  

HTML, and that's about it.

 

The important thing is that we agree to contribute material, and the  

site administrator should be happy and/or paid for their efforts,  

which I suspect would be substantial using either system.  In other  

words, setting up a Wiki site may be easy, but protecting it from  

adware while developing useful content may in fact be easier with  

Plone.  I leave the debate to others.

 

-Greg

I agree, which is why it's important to have an officially  
sanctioned, long-term solution to the hosting of web  
documentation.    No one can afford to spend time developing content  
without assurance that it will be maintained and accessible over the  
long haul.  We need to plan our destination in advance of setting  
out.  This is why agreeing on the technological solution and how a  
site will be supported is important now.  Later, it will be too  
painful to "switch boats in the middle of the river" as we say.

Hi All,

I just want to follow-up on this a bit.

Clearly there are a lot of CMS options such as Wiki and others that have 
already been mentioned. I think though rather than revisiting what tool 
to use, we really need to focus on what content would be valuable, how 
it is organized and who would be interested in producing what content. I 
think that we really need to rely on care and thoughtfulness that Peter 
A-B and Daniel Fuller have already given to what is the appropriate 
solution for managing the content, in this case Plone.

There is a huge amount of valuable information that gets generated on 
this list. However it is sometime difficult to realize the value because 
one has to dig through email archives. There are a lot of topics that 
once resolved could do with some kind of summary, how-to, faq, mini-faq 
(whatever you want to call it). I know there are probably several 
instances where I can contribute some content for example. Perhaps we 
need to start to get people lined up for contributing to various topics 
based on Greg's previous outline?

I. Installation and Set-up
    A. Standard (UNIX) distirbution
    B. Radzilla
    C. Windows alternatives
    D. Other packages

II. Tutorials
    A. Basic
    B. General, Advanced
    B. Electric Lighting
    C. Daylighting

III. Input
    A. CAD links and conversion tools
    B. Photometry & Sky models
    C. Generator programs
    D. Scene processing (xform, replmarks, oconv, etc.)

IV. Computation
    A. Rendering (batch & interactive)
    B. Illumination calculations
    C. Executive programs (rad, rayfront, etc.)

V. Output
    A. Image processing
    B. Image viewing
    C. Image format conversion
    D. Graphing & plotting

I note that there is no section on materials. Perhaps there needs to be 
an item E in section III Input for materials. And perhaps as a sub item 
there should be something on translating glazing data from Optics to 
Radiance, for which I will put my name down as writing something about.

I want to support Jack on this point. Though a big part of us
has some experience with setup and administration of some kind
of content management/markup/publishing system we should focus
our discussion on the things we want to see on the system and
the way how we are going to use it, not how this could be
implemented with system XYZ.

In fact, I think that all popular systems will support the features
we need. Since there seems to be a consent about raising and
spending some cash for the setup and maintenance I would suggest
that we create a 'wish list' (specification) and ask a service provider
or consultant to do the configuration for us. This could as well be
something else than Plone, provided that the chosen SP has better
experience with it and can implement our features.

This could be a possible feature of the new platform. Should the
mailing list migrate to the CMS as well, should we only have a
'connector' to reference and archive emails from the lists or can
we do with a simple externally created digest page for each month?

My personal wish list for the system is this:

1) transparency of content management and storage
    this is more of an admin issue, but should we decide to have
    a hosting solution, guaranteed access to the data and backup
    is a feature we have to request

2) authentication
    could be weak and simple, though, this is mainly to prevent
    excessive spamming and point 3

3) controlled editing
    I like the instantaneous access of wiki pages. But in this
    case I'd prefer to have a dedicated editor for each topic
    who controls and edits the content of the page. I like the
    idea of a 'shadow page' that's open for everyone to write.
    That keeps writers with a short attention span interested.

4) cross referencing
    Judging by our current content structure we will have several
    topics which a dealt with in different places. There should be
    an easy way to navigate between these connected pages. Wikis make
    that very easy - but also very messy. I hope we can find a better
    solution.

5) support for different content types
    there will be at least:
    - plain web pages with images (reference, tutorials, etc)
    - code samples
    - probably quite a few equations mixed in the text
    - PDF and Powerpoint documents from the workshops
    - source code (CVS controlled?)
    - mails (see above)

6) external editing
    Those of us who will write a lot will prefer to use their
    own editor of choice instead of a browser text box. Maybe
    there's a chance for revision control as well.

7) PDF output
    I'd like to be able to 'dump' selected chapters in a PDF
    document. That will make a revised edition of RwR easy -
    and of course useless.

8) email notification/reminders/digests
    basic feature i guess

9) navigation and appearance
    It should be easy for occasional users to find their position
    within the content structure and find related content. It's
    amazing how complicated web pages can be.


In my opinion those are the most important features the system
should provide. Order and relevance is of course open to discussion.
I'm sure someone else will find other features that should be
included or identify some we can do without.

Some of the points above need further detailing (like the editing
workflow) but we could agree on the general functionality we expect
from our new home in cyberspace.


I'm sorry I will be away from keyboard and broadband for the
next week. So please do not feel offended if I can not answer
any replies to this message.

And of course the standard disclaimer:
I'm happy to contribute to the documentation project whatever
I can and in whatever form it will appear.

Regards,
Thomas

Hi All,

I appreciate Thomas' notes and thoughts. I think that people obviously 
have a lot to contribute when it comes down to it. I really think though 
that we need to just assume that the CMS is going to be Plone. This 
looks to be quite a robust tools with a wide range of functionality. 
Let's move the discussion up to the next level please.

Again what we need to do is identify what some valuable content areas 
are and who can contribute content. Greg has already put some energy 
into a preliminary outline of content areas. He can't write everything. 
So who out there is ready willing and able? What are you able to 
contribute? Where do we have content (papers, presentations, whatever) 
that with some editing could be contributed? Where do they fit into the mix?

Here is what Greg, originally suggested in his initial email on the topic:

    I strongly encourage others to rearrange these topics, change names,
    add categories, etc.

OK. I am not sure the best way to keep track of this and/or if there 
should be an approval process. We need an item as follows:

Materials

    primitives
    modifiers
    acceptable/typical ranges
    how to correctly define a trans material!
    how to incorporate glazing information from Optics
    procedural materials (eg modifiers using the .cal functional language)
    methods for sampling (measuring) physically materials

Obviously some of this comes from existing content, some of this 
probably needs to be updated, some could perhaps be integrated from 
other sources (assuming their agreement), for example Georg has a really 
excellent diagram/explanation that I think goes a long way to explaining 
trans materials, and some needs to be written or codified from multiple 
email/list exchanges.

Another possible area where I know at least two other have some interest 
(Lars, Francesco and myself at least), running distributed jobs on 
computing clusters.

I guess I will leave it here as my thoughts are not extremely well 
composed at this point.

Best,

-Jack

Hi again,

I won't post anything any more regarding cms/software for now, if everyone wants Plone, I have nothing to argue against it (as I do not know it) except that I do not see a reason to get an expensive solution for a task that should be simple to implement (meaning that a setup for a working site should be done in a day and without the need to install specialized software). So if someone can do what we need with Plone without spending much money (at least me I do not earn money with Radiance, so my budget is, ahem, limited), do so :-)

I have something to throw into the content discussion. As I see it, Radiance provides users with several learning / support ressources, and not all of it has to / can be covered by a website.

More or less everyone will start by installing the software. Those who do so will first look for an installation guide at the same location where they get the software, it should be linked from the download page and be available as a file called INSTALL.

Than they will start to play around, and we have some kind of a "guided tour" thru Radiance with the tutorial that comes with Radiance. This could be transformed into something more html'ly, like an illustrated step-by-step tour which is something that can be done easily in html, especially if I make the tutorial up with some more hypertext, e.g. linking from the commands used in the tutorial to the online manpages.

Everyone who decides to do a serious work with Radiance (as well as most who do anything with light simulation software) will buy the book "Rendering with Radiance" than, and will get all the ressources of the basic work with the system and the underlying theory from there.

Because we are all lazy sometimes and don't immediately find what we are searching, users will continue to ask on the mailing list, and that is what could be improved a bit by installing a FAQ - not by developing any kind of structure and topics, but by analyzing the archives of the mailing lists.

Than, what is left, what is really missing right now, and what could really be handled by the website? I think it is mainly information that is

1) subject to (frequent) changes, like new / changed tools and features (the mesh type, function files, import- export workflow which always depends on the current software environments)

2) too specialized to be covered in the book in every detail, like function files, distributed rendering, materials

3) updated libraries, for materials, light sources, textures

4) updated links, related projects (e.g. the radzilla project, whih is not and cannot be covered in the book, but is an exciting development people want to know about)

5) projects, people, papers (also the workshop cd-images)

So basically, I think we should not try to rewrite the tutorial or the book in a website, and to keep this in mind when we define a structure.

And yes, as others have been promising before me, yes, I will do my best to put my experiences into this project, and if it is only to learn where I understood things wrong in the past ;-)))

CU Lars.

Dear Radiance colleagues:
 
One of my students is interested in modeling an under-water light
fixture for a swimming pool in Radiance. I have modeled a water surface
in the past, but I am not sure how to model light traveling through
water. I vaguely recall hearing that to do so one must model the water
volume as a dielectric. Could anybody explain to me how this is done? An
example file would be very much appreciated.

"A dielectric material is transparent, and it refracts light as well as 
reflecting it. Its behavior is determined
by the index of refraction and transmission coefficient in each wav 
elength band per unit length.
Common glass has a index of refraction (n) around 1.5, and a 
transmission coefficient of roughly 0.92 over
an inch. An additional number, the Hartmann constant, describes how the 
index of refraction changes as a
function of wav elength. It is usually zero. (A pattern modifies only 
the refracted value.)"

dielectric is needed to simulate water refraction

The problem with dielectric in Radiance is that direct light doesn't 
know how to return to light sources when it cross dielectric, when you 
are seeing a point under the water radiance tries to illuminate it with 
direct light connecting it with direct lights with a stright line but 
when it traces the ray to the direct light the ray deviates with 
dielectric and it probably doesnt arrive to the light source(depending 
on its size and angle of incidence with dielectric).
Probably you will get better results using photton mapping of roland 
with dielectric surface,

Hi Christoph,

> how to model light traveling through water

If you mean seeing the beam that results from scattered light, then  
you'll need to use the mist material.  Check out Section 8.4.2 (p  
457) in RwR.  I recall seeing somewhere that the mist material is  
also implemented in pmap.

Cheers,

Hi Axel,

It's a fair question.  I was inspired during last year's attendance  
of the Color Imaging Conference, where I find myself again this  
year.  It occurred to me that the original scale in false color  
didn't actually traverse that many "named colors," making it more  
difficult than it needed to be to differentiate values.  Having seen  
a number of color scales, including spectral scales like the original  
one I used and thermal scales, I decided that some mix of the two  
might work better.  So, I essentially chose colors from a palette  
moving through the cooler spectral colors, then shifting to a thermal  
scale in the green-to-red (which became a green-to-brown)  
transition.  This then continues on through red and orange to yellow,  
avoiding white at the end as I found it to be confusing.  I can't say  
the results are terribly aesthetic, and the images look a bit bloody  
in some cases, but it is much easier to pick values off the resulting  
scale.

The curves you plotted are simply a result of interpolating the  
colors I chose along the way.  I made some effort and went through  
numerous iterations to balance out the perceptual movement in an  
attempt to keep the scale uniform, again with debatable success.

Subject: [Radiance-general] 3.8 Falsecolor Scale
Message-ID: <4554E25B.2000907@rumblestrip.org>

Hi Greg,

Well, I have been using the new falsecolor scale (in conjunction with 
that very cool vwrays trick you developed with John M. to render 
non-planar clipping "planes" a while back -- very nice!!!), and I have 
to agree with Axel that it's very unusual.  While I totally applaud the 
effort to provide more color points from which to pick off values, there 
are a couple of issues I'd like to point out:

First off, everyone I've ever "trained" in the use of these images and 
indeed most lighting professionals who are facile with the 
interpretation of these images expect blue to represent the lowest and 
red to represent the most intense values.  I'm not up on color spaces 
and indeed even have partially "defective color vision", as the FAA 
kindly calls it, but my brain seems to understand a low-to-high 
intensity progression of blue-cyan-green-orange-red.  It makes sense to 
me, but more importantly it's what I've been generating (and teaching) 
for years.  So to force my brain to remember that blue now trumps 
magenta in intensity has been a bit of a trick this morning.  I wonder 
what the impact will be with clients already versed in the 
interpretation of the older scale of these images.

Second, I have generally overcome the limited color range by playing 
with scale limit and logarithmic mappings whenever a more finite scale 
is required.  This often limits the usefulness of the scale range to a 
specific area of interest in the image, perhaps a wall with a subtle 
luminance gradient that I wish to study, but it works.  I agree it's 
more work, but again it successfully applies the currently-accustomed 
color scale to a fine-grained area of interest.

I propose two solutions to this.  One, re-ordering the colors to better 
fit the old scale, at the very least putting blue at the bottom and red 
back at the top, spectral/thermal realities notwithstanding.  Two, give 
the user an option of using the old scale or the new one.  Like I said, 
I think the additional colors help, and maybe your new scale really is 
superior, once a little adaptation occurs; the option to use either 
scale might ease that transitional process.  Thoughts?

Hi Rob,

Thanks for your feedback.  In retrospect, it would have been smart to  
add an option to get back the old color scale, and I can work on  
adding one.  In the meantime, you can alias your falsecolor to:

	falsecolor -r '1.6*v-.6' -g 'if(v-.375,1.6-1.6*v,8/3*v)' -b '1-8/3*v'

to get back the old scale.  Easier might be to uncomment lines 14-16  
in your falsecolor script and comment (or remove) lines 17-19.

If anyone has references to a preferred scale that runs through at  
least 8 named colors on a natural-appearing scale, I'd love to hear  
about it.

Cheers,
-Greg

Hi Christoph,

John is right.  If you want to see the light beam in the water, the  
mist material is for you.  Follow the examples and stop the mist  
volume right before the light source, and preferably just inside the  
walls and water surface of your pool.  List the underwater light  
source(s) in your mist's string arguments.  You should specify a high  
scattering albedo (probably 0.97 0.99 0.99) and a fairly high H-G  
constant (0.85 or so).

The water surface needs to be a dielectric as Ignacio indicates.  If  
you apply a texture for a natural wavy appearance, you will see the  
distorted bottom of your pool and the scattered beam of your source,  
but you will be missing caustics from the water's surface on the pool  
bottom and the surroundings above water, as Radiance doesn't know how  
to calculate those properly.  Even without a texture, you won't get  
proper illumination of the bottom from lights above, I'm afraid.  The  
best you can hope for is sky contributions from the ambient calculation.

Attached is an example description of a 10 by 5 meter pool with two  
(diffuse) lights.

A new "-spec" option will be incorporated into the HEAD version of  
falsecolor, which you can grab from:

Rob,

> expect blue to represent the lowest and
> red to represent the most intense values

I beg to differ.  When I first decided on a false-colour scale (quite  
some years ago) I had about 15 to choose from in IDL (data analysis/ 
visualisation package similar to MATLAB).   The one they called  
"gamma" (black-blue-red-orange-yellow-white) seemed a natural since  
it corresponded to my expectations (i.e. cold through to hot).  I've  
been using it ever since.  I clip the scale to go from the brightest  
blue through to yellow.  I clip at the low end because part of the  
black to blue transition looks a little too close to the blue-red  
transition.  White at the top is removed so that high values in  
figures wouldn't bleed into background white paper on hard copies.   
Example:

http://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm/pickup/pipe_figure.pdf

I certainly prefers Greg's new scale to the previous version.   
However I will continue to use my gamma scale even though it offers  
less discrimination than Greg's new scale.  I guess I just prefer a  
simple thermal scale.  The only other scale I use in IDL is a red- 
green-blue scale whenever I need to show values either side of zero  
(e.g. the difference between two images).

I suspect the red=high expectation originates with the common  
red=danger/warning usage.  Plus the fact that the red light in a  
traffic signal is always at the top (any exceptions?).  These are of  
course uses of colour in a discrete rather than continuous sense.   
Indeed, whilst red=danger etc. does lead to an expectation that red  
should be the colour for the most intense values (i.e. at the top), I  
don't believe that there is any intuitive expectation for what should  
be below [1].  Or, how the transitions should look.  The rainbow  
scale provides a "natural" solution of sorts.  However, despite a  
training in physics and a familiarity with the progression of colours  
in a rainbow, I still find the thermal scale more of an intuitive  
progression than the rainbow scale.  Whilst I don't see too many  
examples I'm not entirely alone in having this preference: the false- 
colour scheme used in ECOTECT seems similar.

-John

[1] Those familiar with Doppler broadening of spectral lines (where  
the line is both red and blue shifted) excepted.

Message-ID: <4555BEC1.B450.0049.0@wmtao.com>

I find people understand the blue - red scale as well.  Since falsecolor
images are usually presented to clients, having "bloody" pictures is
often a very effective communication tool.  Probably some psychological
thing that dates back to hunting mammoths saber tooth tigers!
 
The one drawback I always saw to the old scale was that if one sets the
scale at 3500 lux, the fist number shown is something like 3281.25. 
(Under that lighting condition, my light meter measures at +/- 10 lux!)
It would be great to start at 3500 lux and have the ability to drop or
set the decimal places.  It always confuses people when I tell them red
is 3500 lux but they can't find the number as they scan the scale.
 
I've not had a chance to try out the new scale but offer the
following:
 
In AGI, one is able to set the maximum light level in the image as the
top of the falsecolor scale like so.
 
http://members.fortunecity.com/dela2/agi1.jpg 
 
Or You can set the scale and make it so whatever you set is displayed
at the top.
 
http://members.fortunecity.com/dela2/agi1.jpg 
 
I suppose in Radiance one could to a pextrem command on a picture to
get the maximum value and then use that to set the scale, but having it
spit out something like the following can be a little intimidating.  :)
 
499 499 0.000000e+00 0.000000e+00 0.000000e+00
322 218 2.706250e+01 2.693750e+01 2.706250e+01
 
I've tried to use this before, but have come up with numbers I don't
feel comfortable using.
 
Seems like a "-s max" setting would be useful.  Where setting the scale
to "max" would automatically check the image and set the scale to the
max pixel value automatically.
 
Hope some of that is useful.

I agree with the red=danger aspect; it's one of the things I like  
about the scale.  Blue is calming, red is alarming.  And another  
thing: clients freak out enough with the few colors we show them  
sometimes; adding more color to the mix may make things worse.  John,  
I can see where you are coming from (Greg too), and I think both  
scales have merits.  THanks Greg for adding the "-spec" option.

Hmmm, what do you mean, you don't feel comfortable with these  
numbers?  I use pextrem all the time in conjunction with falsecolor.   
If you simply run 'pextrem -o' on a radiance image and multiply the  
green channel of the high pixel by 179, you have your maximum value  
for the -s option.

yeah, and this is probably easy for anyone who doesn't suck at  
programming, as I do.  I just spent longer than I care to share  
trying to add such an option to falsecolor.  It should be easy, but I  
couldn't sort out what values to use for certain variables.  Greg has  
already done a lot of the work, since the -e option already has code  
to run pextrem to find the max (and min) values and assign them to  
variables within the script (falsecolor is actually just a shell  
script).  But I don't know how the scale option gets applied to the  
legend.  (Greg, I can share with you what I have so far, if you wanna  
take it the rest of the way. )

I never put in an option to set the falsecolor scale to the image  
maximum because it's usually the wrong thing to do.  There are often  
a few really bright pixels in a scene that may be orders of magnitude  
above the rest.  It's better to go in manually with ximage and use  
the 'l' key to pick out luminance values in the bright regions and  
set the scale based on those.

I think most Radiance users know how to use such an option with  
caution.  If anything, it's a nice starting point, a way to see what  
you're dealing with in a given scene.  I don't see how it's much  
different from defaulting to '-s 1000'; certainly there is potential  
there for gross misrepresentation of the luminous environment as well?

OK, fine.  I added a "-s auto" specification to set the maximum to  
the penultimate foveal maximum as reported by the "phisto" command.   
I didn't make it the default, because it takes a bit longer to  
compute that way.

Even better than a simple max scale; much better, in fact.  As usual,  
you've improved on the idea and, more importantly, executed.  Thanks,  
Greg. Looking forward to grabbing it up tomorrow.

Message-ID: <B8DD8375FCE2C94B9F170D9277C1FA2B8C6484@corvallis>

I ran Mark's Benchmark test on my iMac 10.4.7 Core2Dou 2.14 GHz 1 GB RAM
with Radiance 3.8 Universal binary and I got times around 9000 seconds.
Seems too long. 
I was hoping it would be in the 4K region. Of course I closed the shell
before copying the times, so I don't have the exact number.
For a Core2Duo, does Radiance use both processors, or would I have to use
rad with -N 2?
I know you have to do that with a render farm or any multiple processor
machine, but since the Core2Duo is 2 on one chip, I'm not sure.
For the benchmark itself, I saw Mark only wants single processor results.

That's right, people.  One of the beloved render farm machines at my office
just turned in a sub-4K second timing on the Mark Stock Radiance benchmark
scene.  SSSssssssss!

What's interesting to note is that there are subtle differences in cpu
speed, even among the same cpu model.  I assume this is due to different
voltage settings on the motherboards, but I'm not positive.  I also wonder
how much of the speedup is attributable to the use of the new official
release of Radiance 3.8.  Another interesting thing is that three of four
benchmarks had the same exact number of rays traced.  I find this a little
odd. 

I was hoping Greg and maybe Ferdinand (builder and maintainer of my office's
render farm systems) could weigh in on this.  I have a couple other
benchmark timings and stats to add to the site
(http://mark.technolope.org/pages/rad_bench.html) as well, I was hoping
others have installed the official 3.8 and were doing similar testing.

Happy benchmarking.

Rob,

As it stands, rpict will only open one process, which will only 
load up one core.

I would also like to begin collecting multiprocessor benchmarks, 
but there was once confusion as to how to get a consistent 
measurement across different platforms. Is rad with "-N" a better 
or more consistent tool for preparing multiprocessor benchmarks, 
or is the runsmp script in bench4 better?

I already have a handful of benchmark runs using the runsmp 
script (though it allows more variables such as NCPU and number 
of subdivisions, both of which strongly affect runtime).

Or is it likely that rpict itself will soon support pthreads?

Any input would be appreciated.

Mark is right -- two cores on one chip doesn't mean they both get  
used automatically.  The OS isn't quite that helpful...  The runsmp  
script that uses rpiece (I think?) is better than using rad -N 2,  
since the latter requires multiple views to even run in parallel.

Message-ID: <204C637D-24BD-4086-9FEE-917F690282D0@anyhere.com>

Hi All,

Martin Moeck, who recently moved from Penn State to teaching at  
Arizona State University, has agreed to host next year's Radiance  
workshop at ASU in Tempe, AZ <http://design.asu.edu/sala/>.  We have  
been trying to keep with the alternation between Europe and North  
America, to stay within limited travel budgets for everyone at least  
every other year.  Since last year we were in Leicester, and Quebec  
City didn't work out for 2007 (maybe 2009), I started asking around  
for alternatives.  In 2008, I'm hoping we'll be back in Fribourg,  
Switzerland, if Raphael's offer is still good.

The next question is about the dates.  We were thinking sometime in  
September or early October would be best, but I need some information  
from people as to what week would be best.  We want to avoid any  
conflicts with school years and other conferences, and take advantage  
of colocation opportunities if there are any.  So, please help us out  
with anything you know about.

Thanks,
-Greg

Dear group,

Our University needs a good radiometric CCD camera to make a visual
comparison between physical scale model shots and images rendered in
Radiance. Also we'd like to undertake some measurements of
irradiance/illuminance inside the scale model under artificial skies.

So I need your suggestions concerning what camera to choose.
At the current moment I keep an eye on SBIG ST-8XMEI and ProMetric 1400/1600
series. What else can you recommend?

Hello All,

Does anyone know of a reliable way to use BTDF data with Radiance
simulations?

I am currently working on complex fenestration systems, which I have BTDF
data for, and am looking to asses those technologies via modeling with
Radiance.

How can Radiance deal with BTDF data?

 

Thanks in advance,

Hi Guedi,

You should check out Christoph Reinhart's presentation "Development  
and validation of a Radiance model for a translucent panel " from  
last year's Radiance workshop:

	http://irc.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ie/light/RadianceWorkshop2005/

He has written a paper on the topic with Marilyne Anderson of MIT  
(formerly EPFL), but I'm not sure it's out yet.

Hi Guedi,

You should check out Christoph Reinhart's presentation "Development and
validation of a Radiance model for a translucent panel " from last
year's Radiance workshop:

	http://irc.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ie/light/RadianceWorkshop2005/

He has written a paper on the topic with Marilyne Anderson of MIT
(formerly EPFL), but I'm not sure it's out yet.

Message-ID: <20061122095537.27CB853485@outmail.freedom2surf.net>


Hi All, 

I have a GENSKY question that I cant find the answer to in the archives. I
suspect that the answer is straightforward, but I am now challenging all my
old assumptions as I have just switched from old school desktop radiance to
3R7P2 with photon mapping running under Ubuntu on VMware Workstation.
Daunting, but I like it!

Perhaps first I should state that I am aware from the listings that perhaps
I should be using Gendaylit rather than Gensky, but I have not managed to
compile it yet. Compiling makes me anxious. I used Francesco's Linux
binaries in the end as I couldn't get photon map to compile properly after
3R7P2. My /bin and /lib files are not in the standard location, but I have
altered PATH & RAYPATH accordingly. 

So, to the questions:

Firstly, I have some data for sky brightness from BRE Availability of
Daylight, for diffuse and direct illuminance. If for example, I have
illuminance values of 34 klux diffuse and 26 klux direct can I explicitly
set these in Gensky (assuming 179lux per watt) with 

Gensky (location details, azimuth etc) +s -B 189 -R 145.25 > skyfile.rad

My concern is whether -B or -R overrides the other, or will I ultimately
result in approximately total 60klux horizontal illuminance? 

Secondly, do I have to manually add the following to the bottom of
skyfile.rad. I presume that I don't need to alter any of the parameters here
for a basic sky and ground plane and that it references the skyfunc output
from the gensky command. 

skyfunc glow skyglow

	.8 1.1 .8  0

groundglow source ground

0
4
	0 0 -1  180

Finally, if I explicitly set -B & -R for an intermediate sky with +i does
the +i setting result in an adjustment to the -B & -R values? 

Many thanks in advance

Nick Devlin.

Nick,

-R -B are supposed to specify direct and diffuse contribute.
a quick and easy check is to create a -s (diffuse only) and a +s
(global) sky with the same -R -B and check illuminances at a point (0 0
0, 0 0 1)
Now try without the sky dome and +s (direct only) and see...
you should get diffuse and global and direct values.
Please try it.


About the source primitive, you need it all the time.
Coefficients can be just (1 1 1) for the sky 
and a reduction like (0.1 0.1 0.1) or (0.2 0.2 0.2) for the ground
depending to the model you are working on.
If you use your coefficients you will be working with colour but you
need to check that the photopic average is correct.


Hope this is +s,
i.e. 'clear' 
:-)

Ciao

Hi Nick, Giulio,

One comment to add to Giulio's message...  Just be careful of your
ground definition.

The gensky model includes a default ground reflectance of 0.2.  This can
be changed using gensky's -g option.  So, the normalised emittance of
Nick's groundglow material should be 1.0, not 0.1 or 0.2 as Giulio
suggested.

Cheers all,
Phil.

oops :-)

but be careful when you use the options -i and -s, without the sun
you need also to say -R 0.

If not the 20% ratio will not work, because the ground will include the
reflected sun component anyway...  

Try to compare:

gensky 12 12 12 -i -B 56 

and

gensky 12 12 12 -i -B 56 -R 0

The ground is different.... why is it?

Well this is a funny little thing...  Giulio has found something
strange!

Having followed his test below, both sky definitions provided a global
irrad of 55.7 W/m2.  The reflected ground glow was 5.27 W/m2/sr for the
former model and 3.57 W/m2/sr for the latter.  These correspond to
ground reflectances of ~30 and 20% resp...

Like Giulio, I have never noticed this as I prefer to use a local ground
plane, particularly where sunlight is involved...

What's going on here?
Hmmmmm...

Giulio & Peter, 

Many thanks for the prompt responses. 

I followed Giulio's advice regarding testing the resultant illuminance
values. I am responding purely so that other newbies can find the answers
more quickly next time. 

To test the sky output I produced just one sky description with +s and -B &
-R defined. Created octree with a simple horizontal surface (not sure this
was necessary) and sky. Then: 

Rview -i -vf viewfile.vf test.oct

>From this I derived the direct illuminance on the surface using TRACE
command. 

Then restart rview with same parameters but include -ab 1 to include the
diffuse component from the skydome. Easy. Trace again, and check the values
against my assumptions. 

In short, specifying -R & -B explicitly define. Had just managed to confuse
myself by thinking too hard! 

Many thanks

Nick

Nick,

-R -B are supposed to specify direct and diffuse contribute.
a quick and easy check is to create a -s (diffuse only) and a +s
(global) sky with the same -R -B and check illuminances at a point (0 0
0, 0 0 1)
Now try without the sky dome and +s (direct only) and see...
you should get diffuse and global and direct values.
Please try it.


About the source primitive, you need it all the time.
Coefficients can be just (1 1 1) for the sky 
and a reduction like (0.1 0.1 0.1) or (0.2 0.2 0.2) for the ground
depending to the model you are working on.
If you use your coefficients you will be working with colour but you
need to check that the photopic average is correct.


Hope this is +s,
i.e. 'clear' 
:-)

Ciao

Allright, added.

It's nice how the number of rays traced doesn't change from -O2 
precompiled binaries to the -O3 -fast that Matt used. The 
precompiled binaries seem quite fast already on Macs.

Those new macs seem quite nice.

Thanks for submitting!

Just so you know, you can change parameters within rvu without 
restarting.  Simply type 'set' at the command line in rvu, and you will 
be presented with all the options.  Typing 'set', 'ab', '1' and then 
'new' will regenerate the view with the new ambient setting.

The glow computed for the ground includes whatever sunlight should be  
falling on it.  An intermediate sky has some sun, so the solar  
irradiance (-R) setting has an effect.  (Even if you use -i or -s,  
gensky still computes the ground radiance based on the sun being out  
-- it just leaves off the solar source.)
