Hi Greg,

Thanks for the advice - it's sorted out my problem.  The only slight
change that I made to the commands that you suggested was in the total
command I added 216 after the -id option (since I have 72 modifiers * 3
colour channels=216 columns in the file):  

total -m -id216 -16 -od solar_coefficients16.bin >
solar_coefficients.bin

Thanks,

Andy

Hi All,

Chas has managed to get "Rendering with Radiance" back up on Amazon,  
which was apparently quite painful.  Thanks to his efforts, people  
can now order copies and expect to receive them faster than (n)ever.

Cheers,

Good catch.  I think -id3 would work just the same, and save memory,  
but what you have is fine.

Hello all,

Sorry but I have a basic install question.

I am trying to install radiance on my Apple Powerbook running 10.4.10  
and everything I read talks about a directory "/usr/local/lib"  
however there is no local directory in my usr directory. Should I  
simply make one?

I have been working mainly from the instructions I found here:
http://www.designcommunity.com/forum/8756.html
they were the best/simplest directions I  could quickly find online.

Thanks!

Yes. Just go on and create '/usr/local/' and all the directories that  
might be
required below that (although I think they will be created  
automatically by the
installer if necessary). These are '/usr/local/lib', '/usr/local/bin'  
and
'/usr/local/man'.

'/usr/local' was traditionally the place were software was installed  
by the
administrator. OS X doesn't need it and Apple doesn't expect their  
type of
customer to fiddle with the file system; so they don't provide it out  
of the
box. But it won't hurt your system.

Simple indeed but not particularly admin-friendly. You will end up  
with a
system that mixes the system binaries with the Radiance specific files.

And as I just realised the current download from http:// 
radsite.lbl.gov/radiance
does not include all the files, only the binaries. Following the  
above instructions
would result in an error message after the first 'cd ...' command.

If you are familiar with Linux or another Unix system and think you can
compile the whole think yourself I would recommend you to do that. Read
the README file in the source distribution, run the 'makeall' command
and everything will be installed for you. You have to install the  
developer
tools for OS X first, though (2nd CD iirc or download the updated  
version
from the web).

If you want to go with the binaries you still have to download the  
source
to get the various other files the installation instructions mention.
I would copy the binaries to /usr/local/bin and set the $PATH variable
to include that in your search path. I have modified the instructions  
from
the web page for that:

STEP 2:

sudo mkdir /usr/local
sudo mkdir /usr/local/bin
cd rad3R8_macosx
sudo cp * /usr/local/bin

Whenever you use the sudo command (superuser do) you will NOT be  
asked for the password
you just set for root. You will be asked for YOUR password (once for  
a certain period of
time - a few minutes, usually) and you will be allowed to continue  
with proper rights
only if you have set up yourself as an administrative user
("System Panel -> Accounts -> Allow user to administer this  
computer"). If you are
root there is no point in using 'sudo'.
Use the sudo command with care. There is no limit to the damage you  
can cause with this omnipotent command.

You will get an error about dev being a directory, so it wasn't  
copied. This is fine.

Step 3 Install standard libraries
---------------------------------

Now do the following:

-> Download and unpack source distribution from the above website. I  
will assume the directory created is called 'ray' and it's in your  
home directory

cd ~/ray

mkdir /usr/local/lib
sudo mv lib /usr/local/lib/ray

cd ~/ray/src/rt
sudo cp rayinit.cal /usr/local/lib/ray

cd ~/ray/src/gen
sudo cp *cal /usr/local/lib/ray

At this point you have a functional standard Radiance installation.

The last to steps

sudo mkdir /usr/tmp
sudo chmod 777 /usr/tmp

are not necessary any more. You can install the manual pages, too:

sudo mkdir /usr/local/man

cd ~/ray/doc/man

sudo cp * /usr/local/man

I'm not sure /usr/local/man is included in the search path of the man  
command, though.

After installing into '/usr/local/' you have to change the '$PATH'  
setting
of your shell to include that directory structure into the search  
path - in
particular the '/usr/local/bin' directory. You should find a line  
that starts
with $PATH in the '/etc/profile' file. Make a copy of that file  
before you
change it so you can go back to the original version. Change the line to

PATH="/usr/local/bin:/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin"
export PATH

Finally you can set the RAYPATH environment variable (in the same file):

RAYPATH=".:/usr/local/lib/ray"
export RAYPATH

(I can't find this set on my system and yet all that I do with Radiance
works fine.)

This sets the environment for commands typed in the terminal  
application.
It's only active after you start a new terminal session or type
'bash -login' in your current terminal. This is a good way to find out
if everything is right.

Now you really should have a functional Radiance installation.


Cheers,
Thomas

Thanks a lot Tom!

I believe everything is working, I just need to get my files from  
class to actually check it all out.

Thanks a lot for taking the time to spell everything out, it really  
made everything easy for someone who is very new to playing around in  
the terminal.

Thanks!

yes you can but with some limitations.

you need to write a cal file to describe how the data is collected.

plasdata/transdata are a good start.

Thanks Giulio,

 

Could you explain me the limitations.

 

Thanks again

yes you can but with some limitations.

you need to write a cal file to describe how the data is collected.

plasdata/transdata are a good start.

Dear All,

 

Some one can tell me if it possible to render BRDF data measurement with
Radiance?

 

Thanks in advance.

one is that for indirect calculation it's all based on the r g b
coefficients.

the second is that 'specular reflection' will work just with sources and
not the environment.

so for instance if you are rendering a motorway with a wet asphalt it
will how the reflection of the luminaire but not the reflection of the
other objects.

what are you using BRDF for?

I would like to render BRDF measured data with global Illumination
technique, having predefined complex light source.

 

I would like to simulate the reflection process on the material, for
having a realistic representation of it.

Hi,

 

 

Thanks a lot of the example.

With complex light source I mean that I measure it.

 

Concerning your example I am beginner with Radiance, in test.data I
guess are included the measured BRDF right?

 

Alessandro.

Hello all,

I am completly new to Radiance and I am trying to use it on my AutoCAD,
2007, here is the catch.
I didn't find enough information to build a workflow that allows me to
process daylighting simulation on a windows based machine.
Do I have many, open source or not, options to go from the drawning to the
light simulation?
Thanks,

If you're committed to using AutoCAD as your modeling program, you can 
also check out Georg Mischler's AutoCAD export utilities.  They only 
work on older versions of AutoCAD, though:

http://www.schorsch.com/download/radout/
http://www.schorsch.com/download/torad/

Another option you have is the dxf2rad utility, which is part of the 
Radiance suite of tools.  If you use ACIS solids, you can use 3DSOUT (in 
AutoCAD) to export a polygonal model, then bring it back in with 3DSIN, 
then back out with DXFOUT, then use dxf2rad to convert the geometry to a 
radiance scene description.  A bit circuitous, but it would work.

Good luck and have fun!

I use the circuitous method Rob mentioned.  Also, you can run Cygwin on your Win machine in order to have Unix and a way to run radiance.

Hi Valere,

I think you'd try ECOTECT+RADTOOLS+RADIANCE for windows

1- model geometry in ECOTECT, set location, materials properties
2-export for RADTOOL, set sky, resolution, etc analysis configuration
3-run simulations
4-analyse in IMAGE VIEWER

it's very easy and fast.
You dont have even to buy ECOTECT just use it as a interface to RADIANCE!!!!

see more details in http://squ1.com/projects/freeware

regards,

evangelos

PS. you have to download the RADIANCE 3.7 binaries compiled for windows,
from FRANCESCO ANSELMO site
(here<http://www.bozzograo.net/radiance/modules.php?op=modload&name=Downloads&file=index&req=getit&lid=12>
)

Hi Val?re, and all.

I tried to summarise the possibilities to convert from AutoCAD to Radiance
on this wiki page:
http://www.bozzograo.net/radiancewiki/doku.php/converting_models_from_autocad_to_radiance

Also, I put some quick links to Blender to Radiance exporters here:
http://www.bozzograo.net/radiancewiki/doku.php/blender_exporters

If you're interested in b/rad, please subscribe to the mailing list
http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/brad and send your questions there.
The b/rad presentation page 
http://www.bozzograo.net/radiance/index.php?module=ContentExpress&func=display&ceid=1
has an introduction that I hope is useful enough to get the programme working.

This message is also my "official" announcement of the "Radiance Knowledge Base"
wiki. Feel free to register yourselves and add the bits of Radiance related
information that you think are more relevant for our growing community.

I have started putting the skeleton proposed by Greg 10 months ago (time is running!)
http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2006-October/004054.html

I welcome your comments and contributions to the documentation. There is so
much information scattered across the mailing list posts!

Ciao for now,

Francesco

This is great, Francesco!  Did I miss a meeting, or did you just set 
this up??  That's a great idea to pull key posts from the mailing list, 
distill them and place them in your wiki.  It's a good way to initially 
populate the wiki with good content.  Great job! 

Is the graphic on the masthead a close-up of one of Mark Stock's cool 
renderings, or is that something you did yourself?

Hi Rob,

Thanks for your feedback!

I think that the idea of a collaborative effort to put together the
Radiance documentation has been now around for quite a while, and
briefly discussed during the past workshop.
I just thought it is about time to start working on it ... 
Have you tried to register your account? ;-)

As your eye has already suggested, it is largely inspired by Mark's
magnificent work, but it is only one of my naive attempts, I'm afraid 
:-/ 
It would be nice if each page had some pictures of random Radiance 
artwork, any volunteers?

Among the others ideas discussed, there was the possibility to formalise
our community by starting a "Radiance foundation" (? la Apache
http://www.apache.org/ for example), that is a non-profit/charity
organisation that organises and manages Radiance related projects 
(like further development, setting up a wiki, writing documentation, 
organising workshops and so on ...) and can receive donations:
http://wiki.oss-watch.ac.uk/SustainableOpenSource

But this is a different story ...

Ciao!

Francesco

I'm a newbie of Radiance, I'm now trying to render the illumination in
a building with advanced window materials in Radiance. I've got the
raw BTDF data of these window materials. However, I don't know how to
use them in the material type BRTD. The information given in the
manual and reference are limitted. Could someone give me some examples
on how to use the BRTD function? Thanks a lot.

Hi Yu,

Try starting from here:

	http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/digests_html/v2n5.1.html#BRDF

Unfortunately, Radiance does not compute indirect lighting through  
BRDF materials except for the direct component.  I am working on a  
specialty program, similar to mkillum, to handle cases where a BSDF  
material covers a window or skylight opening, but that is months away  
from completion.

Best,
-Greg

Lots of the posts I sent here were due to a project I was working on
about Hagia Sophia in Istanbul. We used a bunch of modeling apps,
radiance for the daylight and material simulation, and, to mention here,
made heavy use of Schorsch Mischler's dxf2rad. So to give an idea, one
of the images that have been generated from the highly detailed model:

Sorry for that URL... ;-)
