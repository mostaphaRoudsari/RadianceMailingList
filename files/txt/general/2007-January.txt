Subject: [Radiance-general] Modelling glass lamellas in Radiance.
Message-ID: <51FF0016B877EA4B8105EB56B5BC34E01A5D1A@mail2.byg.dtu.dk>

I'm a relatively new user of Radiance and using it from within IESve
(the IES virtual environment program suite), which means there are
certain limitation for the input to the program. I'm currently working
on a research project on glass lamellas for daylight directing and solar
shading purposes at the technical university of Denmark. 

Here's the question:
What is the best way to model the glass blinds in Radiance? 
The glass that I'll be using for the project has the following
characteristics:

Visual properties		
Ext. Reflectance, LR [%]	31	
Int. Reflectance, LR [%]	31	
Transmittance, LT [%]	59	
RA-index	97.3	
		
Solar properties		
Solar reflectance [%]	32	
Direct solar transmittance [%]	40	
Solar Absorption [%]	20/8	
g-vl/solar factor	0.48	

I have been trying to use the material types "trans" and "dielectrica",
in order to benefit from the angular dependent properties of the glass,
I would prefer to use a matrial type which includes the refraction
index.  
Here comes my dilemma:
The material type "glass": in IESve the type does not include the
refraction index which means that the only input is the transmissivity
of the glass. 
The "trans" material type: same problem but at least I'm able to define
the reflectance of the glazing. 	
The "dielectrica" material type: IESve only allows me to enter values
between 1 and 2 for the refraction index which in this case have no
significant effect.
I'm sure that the best thing I could do is to model the whole thing over
again in the "original" Radiance - but as I have a short deadline, I
prefer to get it done in IESve!

Hope someone out there is able to help me out on this one!

Kind Regards

Hi Jacob,

It's difficult to answer your question without knowing anything about  
IESve or what it permits.  You also didn't specify what you mean by  
"glass blinds."  Is this just a window with some odd coating(s) on  
it, or does it have some structure?  Is there some way to give a  
Radiance material description to IESve directly?  When is your deadline?

Hi Jacob.

I've not exactly used IES in our office to create Radiance input
but I have looked at it's scene description files once. There is
somewhere in your IES project directory are folder called 'obj' which
contains all the radiance input files. I think the material library
files are simply copied into that directory where you can modify the
material descriptions after you have exported/rendered your scene.
After you made your changes you can use the Radiance binaries
directly from the command line or a script to do your simulations
with the new materials.

I think you can change the library files (edit with text editor)
or even import an external material file. That allows you to assign
your material in the IES interface and control the rendering from
the interface (for very small values of control ...).

Now, what do you need to write into your files:

I'm not an expert in material definitions. This thread from 3 years ago
suggests to use a BRTD material to define the glass and get a proper  
incident
angle dependent refraction:

http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2004- 
January/001396.html

There is now a script that allows you to
convert Optics5 glass descriptions to Radiance BRTDfunc based materials.
So if your department has Optics5 running somewhere you could look
for a material that matches your glass for the blinds and try to
convert it (the script needs a Unix system, i think).


If you are interested in sun patterns created by reflections on the
blinds you have to use a 'mirror' material. Otherwise the ray tracing
is likely to miss the sun and therefore will not create a bright
spot where you expect it.

'glass' is a specialized form of dielectric with a preset refraction
index of 1.52. It's refraction/reflection does not depend on the angle
of incident light, though, which is what your looking for. It was  
created
to avoid the calculation of reflections between the two sides of a glass
pane and you have to convert your 'Transmittance' value to the  
'transmittivity'
needed for the glass primitive definition if you go that way.

[Note: that's what I understand about glass reading the 'usman.pdf'
        document. Someone should correct me if I'm wrong.]

'trans' materials don't have an index of refraction (not that I know  
of).

If you know how to define the Radiance 'dielectric' material (you can  
look
up the man pages and other texts on the web) you can define your own  
dielect
material in the IES library.

The IESve Radiance files are very simple (as the geometry tends to be).
You just have to redefine the material descriptions to suit your needs.

Thomas

Actually, the "glass" primitive does correctly model reflection and  
transmittance changes as a function of angle, and it is possible to  
alter the index of refraction.  However, I don't think it's  
reasonable to set an index of refraction high enough to get a  
reflectance of 31% as Jacob specified.

Correct.  But you can apply a pattern such as "winxmit.cal" to  
incorporate the influence of incident angle.

Hi Andr?,

I forwarded your question to the radiance-general discussion list,  
asking if anyone there is on the Good Lighting forum.  Since no one  
responded as yet, I assume they're either busy or the overlap is the  
empty set.  It might behoove you to subscribe to radiance-general at  
www.radiance-online.org so you can get future questions answered there.

Radiance is well-supported on Mac OS X, and the precompiled 3.8  
"universal" binaries with instructions on installation may be found  
at the main website:

	http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/download.html

You should download both the complete distribution with source code  
and the rad3R8_macosx.tar.gz link.  Once you unpack the main  
distribution, you'll want to run "makealll library" from a Terminal  
window in the main "ray" directory.  Then, move the unpacked binaries  
to a /usr/local/bin or similar directory and add this to your shell's  
path.  Radiance is a suite of command-line tools, so if you are  
unfamiliar with Terminal and X11, they will undoubtedly give you  
trouble.

The best reference for the system is still "Rendering with Radiance,"  
edited by Larson and Shakespeare.  Charles Ehrlich, the author of the  
lighting chapter, worked diligently to make this book available  
through a print-on-demand service, which seems to have dropped us at  
the moment, so getting a copy is problematic.  I suggest you write to  
Amazon (see <http://tinyurl.com/ycajwm>) or BookSurge.com telling  
them you would like one if you don't have the book already.

Best of luck.

I should simulate a screen material with highly specular reflection

The parameter of spec for trans material isn't described very well in

Hi Friedemann,
 
The trans material is indeed a bit confusing (no offense Greg:)). We did
a validation last year for a translucent material along with some
measurements of a real material. Maybe you'll find the paper useful:

model for a translucent panel", Energy and Buildings 38:7 pp. 890-904,

Also, you might want to have a look at

Hi All,

Yes, trans is very confusing. The link to Schorsch's page is very 
helpful, particularly the diagram. You should also look at pages 325 and 
326 of Rendering with Radiance to see how parameters for the trans 
material can be derived. It would probably also be worthwhile to do a 
search on the archives as the trans material is a recurring topic of 
question, discussion and answer.

I am a bit unclear though about the makeup of your material. You use the 
word "screen" to describe it, this could be interpreted as a material 
that actually has holes in it, in which case the material would also 
need to have a specular transmittance component (arg 7), that is the 
portion of light that pass un-diffused through the material. I am not 
sure but this might even need a more complex material description.

Also you may have some more basic problems in the definition of your 
material. You have the following:

    screen trans spec-diff_80-10
    0
    0
    7 1 1 1 .8 0 .1 0

Note that this implies that there is actually some material modifier 
called "screen" that is modifying the material (of type trans) called 
"spec-diff_80-10". Is this what you intend? Or do you mean:

    void trans screen
    0
    0
    7 1 1 1 .8 0 .1 0

where "screen" then gets applied to geometry?

Note one other item. I believe that it would be extremely unusual for 
the first three parameters to be 1 1 1. Schorsch's page indicates a 
realistic range of .2 to .9. The first three arguments are derived based 
on the interaction of the "diffuse" reflectance of the material with the 
"reflected specularity" (arg 4) and along with (arg 6).

-Jack de Valpine

Hi Jan,

just wondering if there is any news on pmap being made compatible with
R3.8. I'm ready to finalise LEARNIX, and need to pull the plug on pmap
otherwise. I'm happy to wait another few weeks (a month?) if necessary,
but would like to know if it is going to happen.

Hello,

I am just starting to use Radiance and I would like to use it to simulate different luminance sky distributions. I am particularly interested in generating some of the new CIE general sky distributions (there are 15; cf Darula and Kittler "CIE general sky standard defining luminance distributions").  

I found that the "gensky" program can generate a Radiance description of the sky, but gensky appear to be limited to the three classic CIE standards (clear day, overcast, intermediate).  Is there another program that could be used to generate these new standards?

Thank you!

Juan

Hi Juan,

There is a radiance algorithm for modelling the SSLD (new CIE general
sky model) distributions.  It was developed a few years ago now, and is
a bit clunky, but works fine.

I'll send it to you off the list.

Cheers,
Phil.
