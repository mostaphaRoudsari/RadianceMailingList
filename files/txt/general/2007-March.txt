Subject: [Radiance-general] rtrace -i -I flags
Message-ID: <000601c75cd8$5b731af0$c000a8c0@JELLE>

Hi,

 

I'm running a simulation with rtrace, where I've set -I to compute
irradiance rather than radiance values.

Though reading the man pages, I do find the explanations of the flags
somewhat confusing:

 

-i 

Boolean switch to compute irradiance rather than radiance values. This only
affects the final result, substituting a Lambertian surface and multiplying
the radiance by pi. Glass and other transparent surfaces are ignored during
this stage. Light sources still appear with their original radiance values,
though the -dv option (below) may be used to override this. This option is
especially useful in conjunction with ximage (1) for computing illuminance
at scene points. 

 

-I 

Boolean switch to compute irradiance rather than radiance, with the input
origin and direction interpreted instead as measurement point and
orientation.

 

In what cases should one use the -i flag and in which cases is -I the
preferred option?

I find it hard to make the distinction from the docs.

 

Thanks,

 

-jelle

option -I

you want illuminance at 0 0 0 looking up (0 0 1), you sensor is at 0 0 0
and has the photocell up.

 

 

 

option -i

you want to measure that object you can see in direction (1 1 1) from
point 0 0 0. The meter is on the object you are looking at.

(similarly to when you run rpict -i, you get the illuminance over what
you see)

 

hope this makes is clearer...

Jelle.
 
As Giullio has already explained
 
-i    will return the value for a 'light meter' at (x,y,z) pointing in
direction (dx,dy,dz)
      Only that one point will be calculated.
 
-I    will return the value for virtual light meter at (x,y,z) pointing
in direction (dx,dy,dz)
      but it will sample the whole hemisphere around the direction
vector.
      Basically rtrace introduces a virtual plane and turns the 'virtual
light meter' around
      to get the value of a point on this plane. You have to increase
-ab by 1 to get the
      same number of effective bounces as with '-i'.
 
Try a simple scene with both options and low -ab values (0,1,2).
 
If you print origin and direction of the rtrace ray as well you will see
that '-I' changes
them. Quite confusing if you're not prepared for it.

I guess the man page is pretty confusing.  The '-i' option sends a  
ray into the scene, just as rpict would for generating an image or  
rtrace would for generating a radiance value, but then computes the  
incident irradiance at that surface point rather than the radiance.   
In other words, it makes most surfaces (with the exception of glass  
materials) look perfectly diffuse, with a normalization factor that  
computes irradiance.

The '-I' option, which is only supported by rtrace, changes the  
notion of the input to be interpreted as an illuminance measurement  
point as Guilio said, rather than a ray origin and direction.  This  
makes it convenient for placing virtual irradiance meters anywhere in  
your scene.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Stencil method to reduce light leaks from
	adjacent spaces
Message-ID: <FBA1E321-69FC-44AA-BDA6-0B2B582BCE7E@dmu.ac.uk>

Scenario:  Creation of images showing the distribution of illuminance  
across a workplane from a high viewpoint and using the fore clipping  
plane to remove foreground objects.

Problem: With arbitrary shaped/orientated workplanes it is generally  
not possible to avoid including adjacent spaces and wall voids etc.  
in the final image. I usually create a stencil rendering for the same  
view parameters showing just the workplane (now set to "glow") and  
use those pixels to pick-out the pixels I want in the illuminance  
rendering (say, to profile the illuminance distribution across the  
workplane).  See the top two images in this PDF:
http://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm/pickup/stencil.pdf

Now, this method works fine most of the time provided that you can  
crank-up the ambient parameters to avoid light leaks.  These can be  
fairly nasty when they do occur -- the pixels affected by a leak can  
have an illuminance much higher than nearby unaffected pixels.  In  
the example shown, the leaky pixels have a value >1000x (!) that of  
their non-leaky neighbours.  Needless to say, these affected pixels  
play havoc with any numerical measure of illuminance that you might  
want to get from your image.  The computational cost of leak  
prevention can be expensive [1].

I've long had this hunch that the propensity for leaks might be  
reduced if we could prevent rpict from doing any initial sampling   
off the workplane, and so avoid populating the ambient file with  
outside and wall-void values at the zero level.  It turns out that it  
can't be done directly with rpict.  However there is a way using  
rtrace and potpourri of other Radiance programs.  I couldn't figure  
out how to do it.  Fortunately, Greg could -- he came up with this  
suggestion:

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
----

Rpict isn't very good about working on subimages, unless they're  
perfectly rectangular.  However, you can use rtrace to accomplish  
this, with a little effort.  Basically, you need to zero out the ray  
directions on all pixels you don't want computed.  Something like:

	vwrays -ff -x 512 -y 512 -vf best.vf \
		| rlam -if6 - -if1 '\!pvalue -h -H -df -b stencil.pic' \
		| rcalc -if7 -of -e '$1=$1;$2=$2;$3=$3' -e 'out(v)=if($7-.5,v,0)' \
			-e '$4=out($4);$5=out($5);$6=out($6)' \
		| rtrace -ffc `vwrays -d -x 512 -y 512 -vf best.vf` -i scene.oct \
		> stencilled_ill.pic

If I didn't mess up, irradiances should be calculated wherever the  
stencil pixels are greater than 0.5, and zeros will be written to the  
output picture everywhere else.  You can tweak the definition of the  
out(v) function to get a range of values, instead.

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
----

Which worked first time!  Indeed, the approach does seem to be very  
effective.  The lower two images in the PDF show the "usual rpict  
method" and the "stencil method" renderings set to the same  
falsecolor scale (in Photosphere).  In addition to preventing the  
leak, the stencil method was four times faster (I expected it to be  
quicker, but not by this much).  Both renderings were, of course,  
generated using the same ambient parameters -- in this case:

-ab 2 -ad 2048 -ar 128 -aa 0.2 -as 512

These need to be included in the rtrace command for the stencil  
method.  The effectiveness in terms of leak prevention and increased  
speed will be highly dependent on the scene, the view and the ambient  
settings.  As ever, some testing is advised.

For me at least, this is a very useful technique.  And thanks to Greg  
for figuring out the command.

A (slightly belated) Happy (Chinese) New Year to you all.

Hi John and Greg.

Thanks for sharing this tip. I tried it on a simple scene and it works
nearly out of the box:


> 	vwrays -ff -x 512 -y 512 -vf best.vf \
> 		| rlam -if6 - -if1 '\!pvalue -h -H -df -b stencil.pic' \
> 		| rcalc -if7 -of -e '$1=$1;$2=$2;$3=$3' -e 'out(v)=if($7-.5,v,0)' \
> 			-e '$4=out($4);$5=out($5);$6=out($6)' \
> 		| rtrace -ffc `vwrays -d -x 512 -y 512 -vf best.vf` -i scene.oct \
> 		> stencilled_ill.pic


I had to change the 'rlam' command in the second line to

	| rlam -if6 - -if1 '!pvalue -h -H -df -b stencil.pic' \

i. e. no backslash in front of the exclamation mark.

After that I created a view of the scene and a falsecolor image from the
illuminance picture and used pcomb to combine them:

pcomb -e 'ro=if(ri(1),ri(2),ri(3));go=if(gi(1),gi(2),gi(3));bo=if(bi 
(1),bi(2),bi(3))' \
       stencilled_ill.pic fc.pic scene.pic > combined.pic

This command uses the stencilled_ill.pic as a mask for the  
combination of the scene image
and the illuminance plot: where there is a bright pixel in the  
stencilled_ill.pic the value
of fc.pic is used, else it's the scene.pic. The result is a view of  
the scene with the
falsecolor workplane 'floating' in it. I'm sure there is a more elegant
way to do this but I'm happy with mine.

The only problem here is that pcomb requires images of equal size.  
While resizing
the background to the exact resolution of the mask image is no  
problem, the falsecolor
image can have no legend. If you want to create a combined image with  
falsecolor legend
you have to add a space to the left of the scene.pic and the  
stencilled_ill.pic
before you combine the images.

If I can find some time I'll illustrate the whole process.

Hi Thomas,

The necessity of the '\' (backslash) character to escape the '!'  
depends on which shell you use.  The C-shell requires it, whereas  
most other shells don't.

Regarding pcomb and the falsecolor legend, it's possible to cut the  
legend off using pcompos and reattach it also using pcompos after  
processing with pcomb, as an alternative method.

Marija.

I might still have a copy at home which I could
send you this evening. However the patches where
written for an old version of PIL (1.3) and do not
work for current versions.

Depending on what you want to do with it you could
try another HDR toolkit or just call the Radiance
p-binaries (pvalue, phisto etc) in your Python scripts.

Right now I don't know whether ImageMagick does support
Radiance RGBE format and - if it does - what you could do
with it.

Cool to see a growing interest in pilray.
It sure would be great to be able to work with Radiance/HDR imagery in PIL.
If you could share your findings Marija, that would be appreciated!

Hi all,

Which Radiance programs write COLORCORR variable in the .pic image header?

Hi Marija,

Only pfilt writes out the COLORCORR string, and only if you use the  
separate -er, -er, and/or -eb options.  Pcomb, pextrem and pvalue use  
the recorded value to undo exposure changes.

1) What algorithms or freeware would you suggest to make triangles or polygons out of point cloud data obtained by 3D laser scanning (historic architecture)? I need to minimize the number of triangles and would prefer polygons.

2) Now that PowerMac laptops are on the rise, how can I get the most out of hardware life? Turn the computer off at night or use the sleep function whenever possible? Put ice packs under the powerbook? 

Thanks

I have used MeshLab http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/ and VTK 
(directly or through MayaVI or Paraview) for similar purposes.

Hi Franceso,

Meshlab seems to support meshes, but not point clouds? I have raw xyz coordinates from a scanner - no mesh.

Martin,
 
Every laptop I've had said to not leave the computer plugged in 24/7.  Better to buy the best battery up front.  In 2-4 years, you will not want to shell out $150 on a new battery for an old computer.  Ice packs?  Only if you decide to overdrive your processor!

Hi Martin,

I agree with Francesco, (t)vtk is a good option, there is a powerful surface
reconstruction method.
https://svn.enthought.com/enthought/wiki/*TVTK*
Something else you might want to look into is cgal's alpha-shapes.
If you allow me for yet-another-python-plug:
http://cgal-python.gforge.inria.fr/
implements this functionality:
http://www.cgal.org/Manual/3.2/doc_html/cgal_manual/Alpha_shapes_3/Chapter_main.html

Here's a tvtk snippet that might of some use:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

import random
from pickle import loads
from pprint import pprint
from enthought.pyface import GUI

import numpy as np
import scipy as sp

from enthought.tvtk.tools import ivtk
from enthought.tvtk.api import tvtk
from enthought.pyface.tvtk import actors

gui = GUI()
window = ivtk.IVTKWithCrustAndBrowser(size=(800,600))  # Size is optional.
window.open()

# note that this data is generated with ALL rtrace output flags enabled!
f =
open('E:\\EZCT\\EZCT___projects\\Seroussi_House\\01_Correspondance\\send_program_to_marc\\rtrace_values.pickle')
rtrace_values = loads(f.read())

radiance_origin     = rtrace_values[:,:3]
radiance_direction  = rtrace_values[:,3:6]
radiance_value      = rtrace_values[:,6:9]
radiance_value      = ((radiance_value * sp.array((0.265, 0.670,
0.065),'f'))*110.)/3683.
# -> Lux conversion
radiance_vec_length = rtrace_values[:,9:10]


radPts  = tvtk.Points(data=radiance_origin)
radPoly = tvtk.PolyData(points=radPts)
radPoly.point_data.vectors = radiance_direction
radPoly.point_data.scalars = radiance_value

reducedRadPts = tvtk.MaskPoints(input=radPoly, on_ratio=10)
reducedRadPts.output.point_data.vectors = radiance_direction
reducedRadPts.output.point_data.scalars = radiance_value



thresh  = tvtk.ThresholdPoints(input=radPoly)
thresh.threshold_between(radiance_value.mean(), radiance_value.max())

ugrid = tvtk.UnstructuredGrid(points=radPts)



#srf         = tvtk.ContourFilter(input=thresh.output)


srf     = tvtk.SurfaceReconstructionFilter(input=thresh.output)


cf = tvtk.ContourFilter(input=srf.output)
cf.set_value(0, 0.0)

srfMap  = tvtk.PolyDataMapper(input=cf.output)
srfProp = tvtk.Property(representation='s')
srfActor= tvtk.Actor(mapper=srfMap, property=srfProp)
window.scene.add_actor(srfActor)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

from here use window.scene.(save_obj?) to export the reconstructed surface
to a polygon file.

By the way, are you still working on top-down-lighting design approaches
Martin?
Very inspiring research!

Message-ID: <20070319113626.AMI18979@expms5.cites.uiuc.edu>

Dear all,

If at all possible, could you please help on that.

I'm in the process of modeling an office space in Desktop Radiance. Greg provided for me an accurate monitor model as part of the furnishing to be incorporated in this space. The monitor is a .rad file format. I didn't get the chance to insert the file in the cad system. I asked Greg about this and he doesn?t know enough about Desktop Radiance to advise me on how to incorporate the monitor in my model. Is there an advice that might help. The option of accessing the file using the furnishing folder in the radiance menu (by uploading the monitor in the library) didn't work.

Is there is an efficient way to upload the monitor into my Desktop Radiance model.

With thanks and you are much appreciated.

Respectfully,
Mohamad

Are you asking for a radiance to autocad geometry converter?  That I know of, there are only tools for exporting TO radiance, not from.  You might be better off either drawing your own cad furniture or downloading furniture off the internet.  If you use the regular radiance, you could combine both exported cad geometry as well as radiance geometry (from some library) into your scene.

As I understand it, Mohamad is asking how to incorporate a model

be a back door or some trick, but I don't know anything about DR.

Hi Mohamad,

I believe the best way to do this is by using a triangle marker in your desktop radiance scene and then using the replmarks command to replace that marker with the previously created Radiance monitor model.  I don't think Desktop Radiance has a clean way to do this in the interface so you may have to add this to the created rif and rad files behind the scenes.  This is a more complex process and I would suggest reading the Radiance manual pages on rif and rad formats and on replmarks.

Regards,
Zack

The general procedure that I would use is to run Desktop Radiance first 
without the monitor in the scene and then to modify the files that 
Desktop Radiance has produced to include the .rad file for the monitor. 
If the .rad file for the monitor represents a monitor already 
positioned at the right location in the scene (and of the right 
dimensions) then one simply has to add the following line in the .rif 
file:
scene = monitor.rad  and  to add the monitor.rad file to the list of 
rad files that Desktop Radiance has already produced
Assuming the file is called monitor.rad

If the monitor is not scaled correctly and/or not positioned correctly, 
then one must convert the monitor.rad file to an octree first by typing 
the line,  oconv monitor.rad  > monitor.oct, at the  command prompt.
Next you need to create a new .rad file with this octree to position 
and scale the monitor  correctly. This new text file would have the 
following lines:
void instance monitor1
13 monitor.oct -s 1.0000 -rz 0.00000 -rx 0.0000 -ry 0.0000 - t 0.0000 
0.0000 0.0000
0
0

where the number after the -s represents the scale factor
the numbers after the -rz, -rx, -ry represent the rotations (probably 
in degrees)
and the three numbers after the -t represent the x,y,z translation of 
the monitor to the right location in the scene
This new rad file should then be included with the list of rad files 
that Desktop Radiance has already included and, as above, the following 
line should be added to the rif file:
scene = monitornew.rad
where monitornew.rad is the new rad file.
In order to do this you will, of course, need to find out where Desktop 
Radiance stored the files it created.
Lastly, after you have made all these changes, you need to run Radiance 
from the command line rather than from the Desktop Radiance menu.
In know this sounds a bit complicated but only if you are doing it for 
the first time. You do this by clicking on the last .bat file that 
Desktop Radiance created.

Hi all,

Thanks so much for your help. You are much appreciated.

Greg described my problem exactly right. Mark, I started by drawing my own furniture, but I realized that they won't have accurate photometric data. If there is a possible way to model accurate model in cad (Desktop Radiance), I'm totally open to this option. I master the work in the cad system.    

Zack, I couldn?t find the replmarks command in Desktop Radiance. I think it's only available in Radiance. Am I right. Also, I don't know if the DR has the Triangular marker option to use. I read all the information available in the Radiance manual pages, but nothing helped on this issue with the DR. 

Best regard.

Respectfully,
Mohamad

I don't think Desktop Radiance has a clean way to do this in the interface so you may have to add this to the created rif and rad files behind the scenes.  This is a more complex process and I would suggest reading the Radiance manual pages on rif and rad formats and on replmarks.

Subject: [Radiance-general] dtp-rad
Message-ID: <001e01c76b1d$5a32a2c0$c000a8c0@JELLE>

Am I far out of line adding to this discussion that dtp-rad is probably one
of the worst things that ever happened to the general radiance project?
The power of Radiance is exactly that it is founded on Unix principles,
rather than relying on some GUI to abstract the complexities involved in
lighting simulations to the user. I think we should take a position on this
list and to strongly discourage anyone tempted to use dtp-rad. It's a corpse
of the nice (na?ve? )intention to encapsulate the power of Radiance in a
GUI, and choose (god forbid) acad as a place to do so... 

There is a ton of tools that will allow you to work perfectly with Radiance
on win32, but dtp-rad is *NOT* one of them! If you need a positive
definition of what those are, I'm happy to re-iterate those.
There are many competent converters out there, and many project that present
a good interface to Radiance (brad, conrad, schorsch.com)

Can I suggest that perhaps it would be great to have pointers to these
varies projects on the official radiance site, or perhaps
radianc-online.org? Radiance on *nix is pretty straightforward, and is a
different  audience from the win32 platform, where it is *far* more
difficult to set up a decent Radiance workflow, rather than the configure,
make, install routine. I think this knowledge needs to be condensed
somewhere soon.

Cheers,

-jelle

Hi Thomas,

It was easy to follow all the steps you mentioned, expect for the one responsible on how to edit the scale/position of the monitor. The reason is that I wasn?t able to convert the .rad file to .oct file. Basically, I have three .rad files for the monitor, not one. I think one of them is responsible for the positioning/scaling factor, namely VDTon.rad. When typing in the command prompt (oconv VDTon.rad > VDTon.oct), I get error massage. I even tried the option of converting the other .vdt files to .oct, but I got similar/different error massages. Is there a problem that I?m not aware of. 

I'm attaching these files for your convenience, especially if you are interested in taking a closer look.

Again, thank you so much for your help and you are much appreciated.

Respectfully,
Mohamad

My memory of DR is very old, but I seem to remember that it had problems
with two issues:
1) TAB characters in the file - cannot remember if the xform program was
able to sort that one out.
2) The LF versus CR/LF end of line terminations.

I remember I had some fun trying to use the Unix developed models in the
MS/DR environment, eventually giving up and using Linux and the latest
Radiance. (Now I am using VMPLAYER to run the Linux/radiance and sharing
the hardware/file systems via samba - works a treat) - Just export your
CAD model using 3ds or dxf, copy it across to the Linux file system (via
samba), convert with 3ds2mgf + mgf2rad or the dxf2rad method. Then use
trad as a nice friendly gui to radiance.

Hmmm, as long as you got everything, you should be able to create the  
octree.  How are you unpacking these files you got from Greg?  Reason  
I ask is that Greg sent me that very same monitor model and I was  
able to work with it, but when I first tried to use it I got errors  
working on Windows.  There are linefeed issues that can create some  
problems here, and I suspect that's your problem. I'd send you a  
frozen octree, but I can't seem to find the source files here on my  
laptop -- must all be at work (looks like I'm getting my priorities  
straight).  If you like, I can build a frozen octree tomorrow and  
mail it to ya, and we can go from there.

Hi Rob,

Thanks so much for your help and you are much appreciated. It's great idea if you can create the octree files and forward those to me. 

Best regards.

Respectfully,

To add to Terry's observations.

If you prefer a single-platform/single-OS solution, then SketchUp ->  
Radiance on the Mac works very well.  Export 3DS and convert to  
Radiance as described by Terry (or use the 3ds2rad script which  
you'll find on these pages somewhere).

Message-ID: <20070326091746.hxvmfvkis04csc4c@webmail.bankerinter.net>

Hi,

I want to define a material with colorpict pattern, and I plan to use 
non calibrated digital photos of a material sample taken by ordinary 
camera.
If I know the average reflectance of the real material (r ,g ,b) is the 
material defined with next procedure physically correct:
1)normalize photos average brightness with normpat
2)use it in a colorpict primitive:
void colorpict pattern1
7 red green blue picture_norm.pic picture.cal tile_u tile_v

1 A1

3)define basic material with the average grey reflectance as a real material:
void plastic mat1


5 grey(r,g,b) grey(r,g,b) grey(r,g,b) 0 0

4) define alias:
pattern1 alias mat_with_pat material1

I've read previous posts on similar topics, but most of the images 
mentioned were already calibrated, so I'm not sure if resulting 
material in my example would have appropriate appearance (pattern) and 
still appropriate reflectance (basic material). Of course I don't 
expect to obtainr 100% accurate reflectance in each point of the 
material :)

Thanks,
Marija

Marija.

The idea is to define a pattern in step 2 and use this
pattern as a base for the material definition in step 3:

void colorpict pattern1
7 red green blue picture_norm.pic picture.cal tile_u tile_v
0
0

pattern1 plastic material1
0
0
5 0.4 0.4 0.4 0 0


This will create 'material1' with an average reflectance
of 0.4. You can use 'material1' directly in your scene, there
is no need to define an alias.

Using a normalised picture allows you to change the material
reflectance by changing the rgb-arguments in the plastic
primitive (here: 0.4) directly. You don't have to take into
account the average of the picture as well because the average
of the normalised image is 1.

You don't have to use a digital image as source (normpat will
take care of that, too). Only if you want to use the image
as illumination source you need a properly calibrated HDR image
which can only be obtained with a digital camera.

I have a few comments on image maps here:

Nice page, but I think that picture aspect can be set with A1 variable 
in colorpict definition :)

void colorpict pattern1

Right. Think of the total reflectance as material reflectance
multiplied by 'colour reflectance'. If your image has an average
reflectance of 1 (after normpat) the result is equal to the
material reflectance.

Right. There are a few things I should add to that page.

Hi, friends,
   
  I am a post-graduate student in Sheffield University. My project is atrium daylighting and I want to simulate atrium daylight using Radiance. As a beginner of this tool, I have many questions:
   
  1. Do you think Ecotech 5.5 with Desktop Radiance control panel (the newest version ) is the right tool to do my atrium research? I like using it for its clear GUI, but if it could finish similar work and achieve the same results as its UNIX/LINUX brother?
   
  2.  I think a lot of complex atrium roofs have to be researched and constructed in my project, if UNIX/LINUX Radiance is the most suitable tool? If Linux version is good, could I use the Radiance on Cygwin Environment?
   
  3. Someone has told me that Radiance in Adeline is a cut-version, but I found some atrium daylight papers which have used this tool (Anca D. Galasiu, Morad R. Atif from Canada, B. Calcagni, M. Paroncini from Italy). How about your opinion?
   
  4. Mac Radinace is a new choice , I found some researchers recommended the Sketchup + Radiance is a good way. Could you compare this with Sketchup (or Autocad) + Ecotech +Radiance?

I have been unable to find documentation on how HDR images are tone-mapped 
and displayed in Winimage.

A variety of methods were mentioned in the book "High Dynamic Range Imaging" 
by Reinhard, Ward, Pattanaik & Debevec and I was wondering:

1) Which, if any, of the methods described in the book is used in Winimage?
2) How is the "exposure" value in .pic images used in tone-mapping?
3) Which method would be appropriate for building simulation output images? 
(described in cd/m2, global/local functions? computational time?)

Hi Yijun,

Are you referring to the "human sensitivity" exposure option in 
Winimage?  This is provided by the pcond program in the Radiance 
distribution.  The chief reference for that delightful little 
program--aside from the man page--is this paper:

radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/papers/lbnl39882/tonemap.pdf

Jiangto, 

Welcome to the wonderful confusing world of radiance. 

Firstly, I am a big fan of Ecotect, as it is a great tool for modeling. I
certainly prefer it to Autocad, 3d studio etc. It's development was always
intended for use during early design stages by providing quick iterative
results.

However, I would also suggest that using it with Desktop Radiance will not
only seriously limit the analysis process by limiting access to the newer
Radiance functions, but also potentially compromise the validity of your
results and cloud your understanding of the various Radiance analysis
functions and parameters.

So, if you have access to Linux and the latest Radiance versions, I would go
with that, but use Ecotect to build your models and export the relevant .rad
files. You can also export the analysis girds locations etc for use with
Rtrace directly within Linux version. Finally, you can then re-import the
values to Ecotect for certainly visualization tasks. 

I run Ubuntu Linux on my windows machine through VMware workstation, where
you can set up shared folders to move data between linux and windows. 

I would however strongly recommend that you have a look at Axel's Radiance
tutorials from London Metropolitan University as these are on the money as
they say. They can be found at:
http://www.learn.londonmet.ac.uk/student/resources/notes.shtml.

Good luck..

Please also consider the Mac option.

Radiance runs at full steam.

you can use vtk or opendx for cutting edge visuals or any other x11
based system (and these come either free of pre compiled for about 10
Pounds and do work well).

all maya, cinema4d, archicad, sketchup, formz, argon, vectorworks, modo,
solidthinking are native applications.... and many others for good 3d
modelling

Python is there so blender and Francesco and Thomas good stuff is ready
out of the box.

If you need to use Windows you can just have it side by side with
parallel and this works great (for instance you can drag and drop files
from one to the other or use copy and paste seamlessly... ask for a demo
and see it)

Tried keynote for presentations instead of PPT? 

finally you have a native, well working, Unix system but simple to use
and administer, with a nice coherent interface and a full set of system
options:
you do not have two system panels from two different distributions that
try to do the same and one is v1.1b and the other v0.1.1, there is just
one, graphically coherent version throughout...

But I guess if I push more it will be clear that I have quite some
shares 
:-)

Good luck!

I've gotta back up what Giulio said.  I struggled for years to get a 
decent, working Linux/Radiance installation, with limited success.  I 
spent more time learning Linux than radiance, and everyone knows, you 
need lots of time to learn the latter!  When Greg Ward mentioned that 
the latest version of radiance compiled on his mac (December 2001), I 
shot him an email asking for more info about this new Mac OS that could 
compile c code!  True to form, Greg obliged with lots of info, pointers, 
etc.  A couple weeks later I had a PowerBook and a working Radiance 
installation (a fast one, I might add) and was rpicting to my heart's 
content. 

Five years and one laptop upgrade later, I'm still quite happy.  
Especially for a one-machine solution, the Mac is a great way to go.  As 
Giulio pointed out, if you have to have AutoCAD (or any other 
Windows-based program) you can run Parallels on the Intel-based 
MacBooks/MacBook Pros; it's really great.  And you'll find all kinds of 
interesting tips, tools and tricks with Radiance on this mailing list, 
many of which require compiling code, or running a shell script, or 
whatever.  This is all so much easier on OSX since a full, compliant 
UNIX subsystem lies underneath the pretty desktop interface of OSX.

Of course you can get more horsepower for your dollar with a homebuilt 
AMD solution running Linux.  If budget is the driving force, then you 
may want to consider that route, and others on the list here can offer 
some advice in that arena.  Good luck either way!

I'd bet in ECOTECT 5.5 (not ver 5.2) plus the Radiance 3.7 compiled for 
    windows by F. Anselmo! Radiance binaries compiled with Mingw32 for 
    windows, look in: 
 
http://www.bozzograo.net/radiance/modules.php?op=3Dmodload&name=3DDownloads=
    &file=3Dindex&req=3Dgetit&lid=3D12

    Ecotect 5.5 is very fast and easy to model and run daylighting 
    simulations. Model your atrium, after that call RADIANCE Export Toll 
    and voila.
    ECOTECT has a very good interface trough RADtool, they run smooth and 
    you'll have very precise images and analyses.
    If possible, forget Desktop Radiance.

1. Do you think Ecotech 5.5 with Desktop Radiance control panel (the
newest version ) is the right tool to do my atrium research? I like using it
for its clear GUI, but if it could finish similar work and achieve the same
results as its UNIX/LINUX brother?
   
  2.  I think a lot of complex atrium roofs have to be researched and
constructed in my project, if UNIX/LINUX Radiance is the most suitable tool?
If Linux version is good, could I use the Radiance on Cygwin Environment?

How does Ecotect deal with mkillum?

Hi,

just to add it to the list of options, take a look at Rayfront 
(www.schorsch.com) which is a great cross platform tool to both organize 
your project and have a nice GUI for everything you want. There is a 
demo available on the site, so you can try it out.

Second, as you mentioned that you have to simulate a lot of atriums. 
This sounds a bit like a lot of serial and scriptable work. Having a 
Linux machine and learning some bash scripting may be more useful here 
then clicking in GUIs. If you follow some conventions in you models 
(e.g. material/layer names, units, filenames...) then you could automate 
a lot of work and concentrate on modeling and interpreting the results 
instead of starting simulations from a GUI a hundred times. I personally 
like to use make for such stuff, but there are lots of options.

A, and of course, scripting on a Mac is the same as on Linux, Solaris 
etc., I am working most of the time on an old Powerbook and send the 
bigger processes to some Linux machines (which are faster and better 
cooled big pentium4s in my case). So I can actually share the club of 
those encouraging you to set up some nice OS X environment for this 
project ;-)

Good luck, Lars.
