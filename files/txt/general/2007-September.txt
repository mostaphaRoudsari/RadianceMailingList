Hello, 

I wanted to ask sth regarding the view of the sky for different sky models like Perez, intermediate with sky ... to visually see the distribution of the luminance and the position of the sun. I created the sky.rad file as follows for intermediate sky with sun (in Vienna)

!gensky 9 5 14:00 +i -a 48.14 -o 16.2 -m -15 -R 106.5204882 -B 429.0795118

and after using

oconv sky.rad > sky.oct 

I used the rview command as descibed in the book:

rview -vta -vp 0 0 0 -vd 0 0 1 -vu 0 1 0 -vh 180 -vv 180 sky.oct 

But all I can get is an angular fish eye-view of the sky only white, without any  distribution. 

I would appreciate if someone could help me to fix this problem. 

Thank you very much

Regards, Sokol

I suspect is something really simple.

you probably need to change image exposure.

 'man rvu' is a good starting point for this sort of issues.

there is a bunch of settings that can be changed while you see the image
being created.

Message-ID: <5605ec640709050921u73a514e7pd3695b5d5137cc21@mail.gmail.com>

 Hello all,

I want to find the luminance values for a grid of points using rtrace but
from a specific position of an observer.

observer's position (2,0,1.5)

grid of points :  (0,1,0) , (0,2,0)
                      (1,1,0) , (1,2,0)
                      (2,1,0) , (2,2,0)
                      (3,1,0) , (3,2,0)

How do I have to write the rtrace command and the file which contains the
points and the vectors?

Thanks,

Nick

Hi Patrick,

 

If you put your grid points in a file called 'grid.pts' you can use the
following rcalc command to generate a file containing a series of
directions from the observer point to each grid point.

 

rcalc -e '$1=2;$2=0;$3=5;$4=$1-2;$5=$2-0;$6=$3-1.5' grid.pts >
directions.pts

 

Then use rtrace as normal to calculate the luminance values using the
file directions.pts. Ore more simply you could pipe the results of rcalc
directly to rtrace like so:

 

rcalc -e '$1=2;$2=0;$3=5;$4=$1-2;$5=$2-0;$6=$3-1.5' grid.pts | rtrace
...

 

By the way, your points need to be entered in the grid.pts without
commas or parenthesis like this:

0 1 0

0 2 0

1 1 0

 

Hope that's helpful,

Andrew

Hi Everyone,

If you are thinking about presenting at or attending the upcoming  
Radiance workshop at the beginning of next month, now is the time to  
take action.  There is less than a week until the abstract deadline,  
and just three weeks until the workshop is held, and we have many  
slots left to fill.  I am just starting to work on my abstracts, too.

	http://www.dtc.umn.edu/cgi-bin/seminars/symposia/radiance.php

It should be an exciting workshop, and Minneapolis is pretty nice  
this time of year.  I hope to see you there!

-Greg

Hi All,

This is just a friendly reminder that the deadline for abstract  
submissions to the Radiance workshop is today, Sept. 12:

	http://www.dtc.umn.edu/cgi-bin/seminars/symposia/radiance.php

Even if you only plan to attend, we ask you to register before the  
end of the week, so we can get a reasonable head count.  Through  
Katja's hard work and the generosity of the UMN Digital Technology  
Center and other sponsors, we have funding for two invited speakers:

	Roland Fleming of MPI T?bingen, who will speak on Material Perception
	<http://www.kyb.mpg.de/~roland>

	Susan Ubbelohde of Loisos & Ubbelohde, who will present some of her  
daylighting analysis work
	 <http://www.coolshadow.com>

And of course I shall be there, talking about a new method I'm  
working on to take advantage of BTDF measurements for complex  
fenestration in daylighting and annual calculations.

Hope to see you there!

Message-ID: <396328780709121351n5d3109d0gdec947bd48962807@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have a question on gensky. It is stated in the manual that "If the
time is preceded by a plus sign ('+'), then it is interpreted as local
solar time instead." However, I use the following command:
gensky 3 21 +10.00EST -a 40.77 -o 73.967
The program echoes:
gensky: bad time format: +10.00EST

I look into gensky.c and find out that
if ( (tsolar = *cp == '+') ) cp++;
if (tsolar || !isalpha(*cp)) {
		fprintf(stderr, "%s: bad time format: %s\n", progname, hs);
		exit(1);
}
If tsolar is 1, then the program will exit. Does it mean that the
local solar time is not supported? Thanks.

I believe that it is units of radiance: watts/steradian/m^2, this is 
what the manpage for gensky indicates.

Hi All,

We are still short on registrations for the upcoming workshop, and  
have room for additional presentations as well.  If you have been  
thinking about coming, Minneapolis is lovely this time of year, and  
we hope you can make it -- it's not too late.

To round out the talks, we've decided to hold a few tutorial  
sessions.  One will be given by Zack Rogers of Architectural Energy  
Corporation on his Sensor Placement + Optimization Tool (SPOT),  
explaining its design and use.  I plan to give a tutorial on image- 
based lighting, demonstrating HDR image capture, using mksources and  
using a captured lighting environment to illuminate synthetic  
objects.  I may give another tutorial on rtcontrib as well, depending  
on time constraints.

?Visual Perception of Surface Material?
Different materials such as silk, bronze and marmalade have  
distinctive visual appearances.  Human observers are remarkably adept  
at recognizing materials across a wide range of viewing conditions  
and we are only just beginning to work out how.  What gives a  
material its characteristic ?look??  What cues does the visual system  
use to identify materials?  How can we leverage the assumptions made  
by the visual system to improve computer graphics?  I will review  
some of our research on the perception of material properties such as  
gloss, translucency and refractive index that attempts to shed some  
light on these questions.  I?ll talk about how illumination and 3D  
geometry interact with material perception, and discuss the role of  
various image statistics (e.g. intensity histogram, amplitude  
spectrum) in the visual estimation of material attributes.  I?ll then  
show one application in which we exploit the heuristics made by the  
visual system to enable illusory modifications of material appearance  
in photographs.

"Comparing an interactive hybrid global illumination method with  
Radiance"
Complex fenestration systems (CFS) can be used to redirect intense  
illumination from the sun to more evenly illuminate an architectural  
space and thus reduce the lighting needs of buildings. However,  
standard distribution of Radiance does not support rendering of CFS  
or arbitrary BRDF/BTDF material data. In this talk, we present an  
interactive rendering system for architectural design which simulates  
a CFS based on 4D Bidirectional Transmission Distribution Function  
(BTDF) data. We use a hybrid method of shadow volumes for direct  
illumination and radiosity for indirect illumination to achieve  
interactive rendering rates.
Our system is appropriate for use in schematic design: an early stage  
of the architectural design process where scale, appearance, and  
adjacencies of an evolving design are explored. We demonstrate our  
system on several models inspired by field observations and the  
designs of architecture students we have consulted during the  
development of this project.

?Effect of test patch location on color appearance, in the context of  
3D objects?

Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA. (2) Department of  
Psychology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA.

The light reflected from different locations on a single object can  
vary enormously.  This variation is enhanced when the material  
properties of the object are changed from matte to glossy.  Yet  
humans have no trouble perceiving an object as having a unified  
color.  We conducted a psychophysical experiment to study how people  
perceive the color of different parts of an object.  Observers viewed  
graphics simulations of a three-dimensional scene containing two  
objects, test and match (generated with Radiance in conjunction with  
custom software that provided full spectral rendering).  The test  
object was a soccer ball that had one colored hexagonal face (test  
patch).  Observers were asked to adjust the color appearance of a  
match sphere to the test patch.  The match sphere was always matte,  
while we varied the surface gloss of the entire soccer ball  
(including the test patch).  The test patch could be located at  
either an upper or lower location on the soccer ball.  The data show  
that there is an effect of test patch location on observers? color  
matching, but this effect is small compared to the physical change in  
the average light reflected from the test patch across the two  
locations.  In addition, we found that observers exhibit stability of  
color perception of the test patch in the face of variation of  
surface gloss.

Tutorial: ?Image-based Lighting?
Image-based lighting (IBL) is a set of techniques originated by Paul  
Debevec for incorporating synthetic objects into real-world scenery  
<www.debevec.org>.  IBL is widely used by the movie industry for  
special effects production, and offers some interesting possibilities  
for daylight simulation as well.  In this tutorial, Greg will  
demonstrate how easy it is to capture a high dynamic-range  
environment map (a.k.a. a "light probe") using a standard digital  
camera and use it to render synthetic objects into a background plate  
with the help of Photosphere and the "mksource" program.  We will  
discuss how other researchers, such as Santiago Torres, have employed  
IBL and Radiance for daylighting simulation.

This talk will present recent updates to the Sensor Placement +  
Optimization Tool software that acts as a front-end interface to  
Radiance. SPOT has grown to provide more detailed electric lighting  
and annual daylighting analysis as well as providing photosensor  
control analysis. The focus of the presentation will be on the new  
features of the software and a case study will be presented of a  
project in which we used SPOT to help design a daylight responsive  
control system. The talk will be 25 minutes followed by a question

?Experiences with Radiance in Daylighting Design, Part III?
Zack Rogers, Galen Burrell and Jennifer Scheib, Architectural Energy  
Corporation

This talk will present some of the Radiance modeling Architectural  
Energy Corporation has done in support of our Daylighting Design  
Consulting work, focusing on the various ways we have used Radiance  
to guide the design process.
Radiance has proved to be extremely effective in analyzing and  
visualizing daylighting designs, allowing numerous daylighting design  
alternatives to be explored beforehand, informing and guiding the  
daylighting design decisions of a project.  The types of daylighting  
design projects that will be highlighted vary widely and include  
schools, laboratories, offices, museums, atriums, and others.  The  
focus of the presentation will be on new work that has occurred since  
the Montreal radiance conference in 2005.

The talk will be broken into three-20 minute sections, one section  
given by each of the presenters followed by a brief question and  
answer period.

?Utilizing BTDF Window Data?
This talk presents some new ideas and software for exploiting  
measured and simulated bidirectional transmittance distribution  
function (BTDF) data in Radiance.  Programs and standards for  
providing BTDF data are emerging (e.g., LBNL Window 6), and we wish  
to take advantage of it in our simulations.  Two approaches will be  
presented, one geared towards traditional daylight simulation and  
rendering and the other towards annual calculations.  The first  
approach resembles mkillum but without the usual restrictions, since  
BTDFs can represent virtually any complex fenestration type.  The  
second approach requires two passes of rtcontrib, one to account for  
the building exterior, and the other for the interior.  This fully  
separates illumination from geometry and permits time-based  
fenestration controls to be simulated efficiently.  As this  
constitutes work in progress, suggestions will be most appreciated.

?RenderToolbox: A MATLAB Toolkit for Hyperspectral Rendering with  
Radiance and PBRT?
Daniel P. Lichtman, Bei Xiao, David H. Brainard

We describe a set of Matlab software tools, the RenderToolbox, that  
aid in the modeling and rendering of images for use in psychophysical  
experiments. The toolbox, which we are making freely available, has  
several important features. First, it allows the user to model scenes  
in the popular Maya software package and export these into the  
remainder of the rendering pipeline. Second, although the toolbox  
inherits the scene geometry from the Maya modeler, it allows the user  
to associate full spectral reflectance functions and parametric BRDFs  
with each object, and full spectral power distributions with each  
illuminant. The toolbox then parses the scenes and associated  
reflectance/illuminant parameters and passes these to either of two  
renderers. These are Radiance and Physically Based Rendering Tools  
(PBRT). It invokes the renderers on a wavelength-by-wavelength basis  
to produce a hyperspectral image of the scene. The fact that the  
toolbox transparently supports two renderers allows easy comparison  
of their performance. In addition, the toolbox is configured to make  
it easy to re-render the same scene geometry with different choices  
of reflectance/illuminant parameters. Fourth, the package provides  
support for converting the hyperspectral image to standard color  
representations. Finally, the package supports parallel rendering of  
the separate wavelength images if a computer cluster is available.  
Several example scenes are included with the toolbox to demonstrate  
its use and to compare the two renderers? performance. The simplest  
example, a uniformly reflective surface and a single point-light  
source, yields two nearly identical images. Each of these matches an  
analytical prediction based on the light's spectral power  
distribution and surface's reflectance function. A second example  
scene includes a single sphere with uniform reflectance under a  
distant point-light source. Again, images rendered by Radiance and  
PBRT are well-matched to each other and to the directly calculated  
image based on the Ward model of surface reflectance. The close  
agreement of the two renderers with each other and with direct  
calculations for simple scenes provides added confidence that each  
renderer is doing a good job simulating physical light flow.

11:20-12:00
Susan Ubbelohde, Loisos + Ubbelohde Associates, Oakland, CA

?Daylighting in Practice: Radiance and the Design Process?
Loisos + Ubbelohde is a consulting and design firm specializing in  
sustainable architecture.  Our consulting work focuses on advanced  
daylighting design and performance, energy modeling and alternative  
energy sources. In practice, the use of tools such as Radiance and  
physical models is never as direct and linear as theory might  
assume.  Rather, our use of design and evaluation tools is  
continually adapted to the design direction of the project, the  
questions posed by the architects, the tradeoffs and negotiations  
necessary with mechanical, structural, electrical engineers, lighting  
designers and interior designers on the design team, and the goals  
and concerns of the building owners and the requirements of outside  
agencies such as the US Green Building Council. We will present a  
range of recent projects, both consulting projects and design  
projects, discussing our use of modeling tools in the projects.

12:00-1:30 Lunch	

1:30-2:30
Greg Ward, Anyhere Software, Albany, CA

Tutorial: ?Improved Color Rendering with RGB?
Accurate color rendering requires the consideration of many samples  
over the visible spectrum, and advanced rendering tools developed by  
the research community offer multispectral sampling towards this  
goal. However, for practical reasons including efficiency, white  
balance, and data demands, Radiance still employs a simple RGB model  
in its lighting calculations. Applied naively, this can result in  
colors that are qualitatively different from the correct ones. In  
this tutorial, we demonstrate two independent and complementary  
techniques for improving RGB rendering accuracy in Radiance without  
impacting calculation time: spectral prefiltering and color space  
selection. Spectral prefiltering is an obvious but overlooked method  
of preparing input colors for a conventional RGB rendering  
calculation, which achieves exact results for the direct component,  
and very accurate results for the interreflected component when  
compared with full-spectral rendering.  In particular, we demonstrate  
the merits of a particular color space transform that has emerged  
from the research community as the best performer in computing white  
point adaptation under changing illuminants: the Sharp RGB space.

Message-ID: <1249713113.8861190432374279.JavaMail.root@babel.archenergy.com>

Hello,

I am trying to simulate a window optical daylighting system (LightLouver) in Radiance and am seeing some weird behaviour.

The IES file I am modeling is completely asymmetric and it appears as if Radiance treats the horizontal angles in a clockwise fashion whereas the IESNA standard is to treat the horizontal angles in a counter-clockwise fashion.? A photometric representation of the file can be seen here:

http://home.comcast.net/~z.rogers/LiLo_photometric1.jpg

and here:

http://home.comcast.net/~z.rogers/LiLo_photometric2.jpg

This is an IES file that I made for a daylighting system that sits vertically in a window using a forward ray-tracing program (TracePro).? I defined it with Type C photometry; the 0 vertical angle is perpendicular to the window pointing into the room and the 0 horizontal angle is up (+Z).? The window is roughly 5' wide by 2' high and can be seen in these images as the blue rectangle.? It is apparent that the main daylight distribution is entering the room, above the horizontal and angled to the left as it enters the space.? This is as expected as this is for a south-west facade at noon.? This illustrates that the IES file was defined with the horizontal angles proceeding in a counter-clockwise fashion according to a right-hand rule.? And the the 0 horizontal angle is defined as up or in the direction of the smaller window dimension.

I then attempted to place this IES file into the room I am modeling, seen here:

http://home.comcast.net/~z.rogers/Lilo_room.jpg

which gives me this rendering (low quality but the distribution of light is apparent):

http://home.comcast.net/~z.rogers/lilo_e12pm_bad.gif

So my first question is relative to the 0 horizontal angle and which axis IES2RAD assumes for this.? It reads in the source.cal file that +x axis is the 0 horizontal angle and the -y is the 90 deg angle.? However, to get the rendering shown above I had to have my replmarks marker with +y up which seems to disagree with the header of the source.cal file.? I also have to define the longer dimension as x and the shorter dimension as y, similarly in disagreement with the source.cal file header.? When I try rendering it with +x as up I get a strange and obviously incorrect rendering.? Is this a bug or am I mis-interpreting this?

My second question is relative the progression of horizontal angles.? The rendering obviously disagrees with the photometric illustration as the light is entering the room to the right rather than to the left as it was in the photometric view and as it should be given my daylight conditions.? Does Radiance treat the horizontal angles in a clockwise (left-hand rule) fashion or am I mis-interpretting this?? IESNA does define the other way.

The fix I figured out for this second issue is in the source.cal file.? Instead of this:

src_phi = mod( Atan2(Dy, -Dx) / DEGREE, 360 );??? { 0-360 }

I made the -Dx a positive like this:

src_phi = mod( Atan2(Dy, Dx) / DEGREE, 360 );??? { 0-360 }

and this gave me a rendering with the light going in the direction I was expecting.

One final question; anybody have a way to get Type B photometry into Radiance?? It seems like IES2Rad does not like this type.

I hope all that made sense.? Any help is much appreciated!? I hope to see some of you at the upcoming conference!

Regards,
Zack

Hi,

I have a question about the rendering with sun. I generate the sun and
sky using
"gensky 3 21 10:00EST -a 40.77 -o 73.967 -g .2". The sun brightness is
6.63e+06. It's a big number.  When I render my scene with the sun &
sky, and adjust the exposure. The generated image can be viewed in
http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~shengyu/sunny.png. However, the exposure is
only 4.537687e-02. If the sun light directly reach the
sunlight-redirecting panel in the scene, how can an exposure of
4.537687e-02 can adjust the color in the range of 0 and 1 because the
sun brightness is such a big number?

Thanks.

Hi Zack.

I haven't looked at IES files in a while so my memory is a bit mushy
and I can't go into the details of the standard as I don't have a copy.

But:

I think it's ies2rad that creates the confusion here. In the man page  
it says:

"The light source geometry will  always  be centered  at  the  origin  
aimed
in the negative z direction, with the 0 degree plane along the x axis."

This is fine for luminaires as they usually have their highest output in
negative z direction ('down') but define this in the IES file as 0  
degree
vertical angle (the vertical angles start pointing down and then go up).
In your case ies2rad might simply have turned the z-axis around so  
that your
+z is now pointing down.

If you use replmarks to place your windows you have to define the longer
axis as x and the sorter will be y. This is just how replmarks works and
is independent of source.cal.

I used to check the Radiance renderings of luminaire files against a  
rendering
of another application like Dialux or Relux just to check if I did  
the placement
and rotation of the IES file right.

Regards,
Thomas

Thanks for your response Thomas.  I still think IES2rad is reading files differently than the standard (clockwise and with 0 as +y).  

I did figure out the Type B photometry issue, seems this is only a problem within Rayfront.  Using IES2rad outside of Rayfront does not have a problem, my apologies.  Everything else shown was also done outside of Rayfront as I was wanting to eliminate this from the equation.

Regards,
Zack

Hi Zack.

I haven't looked at IES files in a while so my memory is a bit mushy
and I can't go into the details of the standard as I don't have a copy.

But:

I think it's ies2rad that creates the confusion here. In the man page  
it says:

"The light source geometry will  always  be centered  at  the  origin  
aimed
in the negative z direction, with the 0 degree plane along the x axis."

This is fine for luminaires as they usually have their highest output in
negative z direction ('down') but define this in the IES file as 0  
degree
vertical angle (the vertical angles start pointing down and then go up).
In your case ies2rad might simply have turned the z-axis around so  
that your
+z is now pointing down.

If you use replmarks to place your windows you have to define the longer
axis as x and the sorter will be y. This is just how replmarks works and
is independent of source.cal.

I used to check the Radiance renderings of luminaire files against a  
rendering
of another application like Dialux or Relux just to check if I did  
the placement
and rotation of the IES file right.

Regards,
Thomas

Not IES2Rad - I think it's actually source.cal that reads the angles differently.  My apologies.
