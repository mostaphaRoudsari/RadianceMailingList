Hello fellow raytracers,

I have what I believe to be a rather oblique question. I've used Radmap
before, to get estimations on PV array feasibility. However, I was
recently asked about the feasibility of landscaping in a dense urban
environment. After a lot of searching, I could not find what I had hoped
to find - a categorical list of what grows given a quantity of light, in
terms of light energy, light power*time, illuminance*time, or something
along those lines. I'm left with finding spaces with similar geometry
and determining what is growing and what is not. The only reference I
could find with respect to Radiance was from 1995, with Greg suggesting
that replacing the RGB channels with some quantities that were better
suited to the response of plants. I know it's a stretch to hope that
there are any horticulturists on the list, but has anybody else come
across information or situations involving photosynthetically active
radiation? Any insight is appreciated.

Also, I use Linux on a VirtualPC (Microsoft freeware) in Windows
(Intel). It's sort of like VMWare where a computer is virtualized and
simulated in a "sandbox". It's a clumsy and resource hogging amalgam,
but does let you play around with some of the more fun features of the
*nix versions without a whole lot of hardware and setup hassle. cat
/proc/cpuinfo gives the specs of the main processor, so I wonder what
happens when you run it on a VirtualPC/AMD combination...

Thanks, Greg. I'll think about that one. This kind of issue is part of  
why I'm asking about platforms. I can see chasing down OpenGL issues  
for one or two platforms; six would be insane.

Thanks!

I suppose I'd qualify that as Linux; for my purposes it is, anyway.

Ecotect ships a native Windows version--not sure how that was built.

Hi Randolph,

 

I'm currently running RADIANCE on Cygwin, but previously used MS
Services for Unix.  I ran into a few weird compatibility type problems
with SFU (I don't remember the specifics now) and in the end decided to
switch to Cygwin because it seems to be better supported (for other Unix
type tools as well as for RADIANCE).

 

I've also previously made a comparison between Linux (Suse) running as a
virtual machine under windows (using MS Virtual PC) and Cygwin.  Using
the test case from Mark Stock's benchmark page I found that Cygwin was a
bit faster than the virtual PC (something like 15-20% faster) - at least
on my specific PC for that specific test case.

 

Andy

It's probably not possible to implement a virtual machine that's as  
fast as native operation without extensive support from the processor  
vendor. I think only IBM does this at this time, in their large-scale  
server systems. OK, thanks.

Hi David.

Virtual PC by Microsoft is as far as I know a pure software
simulation of a PC that predates the hardware support that's
built into new Intel/AMD chips. It's clumsy and resource hogging
because it simulates an entire PC instead of sharing the hardware
between two operating systems as VMware or Parallels on Mac
does.

If you're looking for a faster and free alternative you can
google for Xen (which has the Linux setup hassle mentioned
above) or VirtualBox (Sun freeware).

On the subject of CPU type it should not matter much which
CPU you are running on. You will get the better performance
out of the CPU that's supported better by your virtualisation
software. In the case of Virtual PC I'd guess it makes no
difference at all.

Regards,
Thomas

This sounds really exciting what you are trying to do there. However, as 
it seams to be related to climate, not only illumination, I really 
wonder if a more general simulation tool such as esp-r could be used 
here. To decide what grows where, assumptions of temperature, humidity, 
air flows would be important too. So you would get a climate profile of 
a location from a simulation run and could try to find suitable 
vegetation according to that. I know of lists of plants used e.g. in 
parks, public spaces and gardens, showing basic requirements, but 
nothing in terms of physical units. So I guess this is something that 
would have to be started yet... I am very curious about what you are 
doing, and will try to get some details from a friend who is in botanics.

Hello,

I'm aware of a pretty recent thread addressing installation of Radiance on
Ubuntu, but I am a brand new user of Ubuntu, so I do not even know where to
start to install Radiance. I've only used Windows before, and I have no
programming background so I'm sure I'm just looking at this the wrong way.
That aside...

I downloaded and extracted "rad3R9_linux.tar.gz" to the folder
"rad3R9_linux" to my desktop. I'm using the Ubuntu GUI called Gnome (I
think). I just installed the Ubuntu LTS Desktop Edition version 8.04.

Inside the rad3R9 folder seems to be no installation file (again, I'm
thinking like a Windows user). I understand there should be some time of
command line for Ubuntu... can someone get me started with a few steps or
point me to a link that might have some step-by-step instructions for the
Ubuntu/Radiance novice?

Thank you,
Nick

Hi Nick,

I would suggest to start experiencing with the linux/unix terminal:
you'll see that you will use it quite a lot with Radiance! ;-)

Just open a terminal window (Application/Terminal or Alt-F2 and type  
"gnome-terminal")
and write

sudo apt-get install radiance

The apt package manager downloads a precompiled radiance package, so  
that
you don't have to compile or extract the Radiance binaries yourself.

Alternatively you can use the Synaptic package manager, accessible
from the System/Administration menu.

Look for the radiance packages, and install them.

That's all! Oh well, that's just the beginning.
There should be some radiance examples in the /usr/share/radiance  
folder,
or something similar. Try to familiarise with them and buy yourself
the Radiance bible:
http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/book/
http://tinyurl.com/67hw9r

HTH.

Francesco

Francesco,

Thank you, I typed "sudo apt-get install radiance" in Terminal and it seems
that worked.

However, I have no idea what to do next.

I tried following the instructions on the Wiki you suggested, but it seems
like there are many different commands to do the same thing, and I'm not
sure which applies to me. (However I tried all of them).

Basically, after typing in "sudo apt-get install radiance" what do I type
next in order to open Radiance? (so I can start inputting the scenes from
the "Rendering With Radiance"
 tutorial).

Thanks,
Nick

Hi Nick,

Oh, you just double-click the Radiance icon.  Not really.  =8-)

You will find that Radiance is actually a large collection of command 
line tools that you interact with more in a terminal window rather than 
a more traditional GUI/window/menu interface.  Actually, if you have the 
Rendering with Radiance book and tutorials, you can simply follow those 
and you will see how it all comes together.  Once you get used to the 
lack of menus, you will actually find it quite liberating, since you 
will discover that Radiance is a box of tools waiting to be told what to 
do for you.  You can use scripts to create various rendering and 
calculation engines that can produce a lot of useful data. 

Good luck, and be sure and use this list (and the archives) as a 
resource for your explorations with Radiance.  I've been using the 
software regularly for seven years now and still haven't scratched the 
surface.  Have fun!

Hi Abubakar,

Do you need to compile Radiance for any specific reason?
If not, you can just download the executables from here:
http://www.bozzograo.net/radiance/modules.php?op=modload&name=Downloads&file=index&req=getit&lid=22
It is a windows setup wizards.

Here's a bit of copy+past from a recent message (regular readers
might have a deja-vu experience here):

First you have to get an idea about what Radiance is. I'd recommend
to read and follow the documents linked on this page:

	http://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/learnix/docs.shtml

This should give you a good understanding of the basic interaction  
between
the Radiance tools. Further you can download a lot of e-papers from

	http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/framer.html

Some of these documents are a bit dated but the principles have not  
changed.

That should keep you busy for a while.


Further notes on Ubuntu/Linux:

If you're new to Linux/Unix you have to become familiar with the command
line and a friendly text editor of your choice. There're a lot of  
books available
that will make you an Unix guru in 7 days for $9.95. Just pick one.

On Ubuntu (or Debian etc) you should check /usr/share/doc/radiance
or where ever the distribution stores the docs. In particular search for
the notes about renaming of applications (genbox -> genrbox in  
particular)
or you won't have much fun with the old tutorials. Radiance comes with
a bunch of PDFs and text files which are worth reading.

Then read the man pages for the most interesting apps:
rad, rpict, rtrace, oconv, ximage, rvu. They contain examples of  
their use
and all together should give you an idea about how things are supposed
to work.

Regards,
Thomas

Message-ID: <694e132c0807091654q65cb17a3l2d4b7d49413cbcc5@mail.gmail.com>

I had never tried it, so out of curiosity, I took Francesco Anselmo's
MinGW Radiance 3.8 installation and ran Mark Stock's Radiance
Benchmark on it in Windows XP. Surprisingly, the only real thing I had
to change was to make a copy of xform.exe in the same directory and
call it cat.exe - xform without any transformation arguments is
essentially cat (right?), and none of the cat lines had arguments. I
may have had to rename genrbox to genbox, but I think I did that a
while ago.

After downloading and unpacking the benchmark package (try 7zip), make
a batch file (a text file with a .bat extension) with the following
lines (based on the Makefile):

obj2mesh -n 15 -r 16384 lens.obj > lens.msh
oconv -f -n 6 -r 16384 materials.rad cube2f.rad > cube2f_instance.oct
oconv -f -n 6 -r 16384 materials.rad cube4f.rad > cube4f_instance.oct
oconv -n 6 -r 16384 materials.rad scene.rad > scene.oct
rpict @viewpoint @options -x 2048 -y 2048 -t 60 -o windows.unf scene.oct
pfilt -1 -e +0 -x /4 -y /4 -r .6 -m .15 windows.unf > windows.pic
del windows.unf
ra_bmp windows.pic > windows.bmp

Make sure your PATH variable is set to the MinGW installation's bin
directory, and run the batch file from a DOS prompt in the folder with
the benchmark files. This 2.13 GHz Core 2 got 4614.84 sec, on XP Pro
SP2 (683733972 rays) without Cygwin, XMing or virtualization. (Thanks

hii everyone,

I am a new bie for radiance,its really a gr8 tool for lighting analysis.
I am using radiance with frontend ecotect.
I could do the daylighting analysis in radiance with the geometry exported from ecotect.
For artificial lighting, i had put the light source in ecotect and then exported it to radiance, but it seems simulation engine does not translate the same light source in radiance.
can ne1 shed some more light on this. and even how can i plug in the IES file in ecotect or radiance.
It would be really of gr8 help.

There is a tool called ies2rad included in radiance, which will 
translate a ies-formatted distribution to a light source in Radiance. 
The process is also described well in RwR, or in the various tutorials. 
Still, you must be careful - the orientation of some ies-distributions 
seams to be a cause for errors frequently, and you also have to make 
sure that the units in the ies-file fit those in the scene (or the 
translation corrects this). It is good practice to place the light 
source, after the translation, using !xform-statements - that way you 
can easily change them.

Dear all,

I'm using ESP-r coupling Radiance.Through "daylight coefficient" approach, I
get the illuminance of an indoor photocell location, but the illuminance is
more than 40000 lux. I think it must be much more intense than reality.

Does anybody have any ideas about why that? And how to cut down the illuminance?

thank you.

Hi,

even those who use ESP-R more frequently will have a problem to debug
this without knowing anything about what you model. Are you sure that
your model is closed? Sounds like you forgot the ceiling what you got
there ;-)

If you're seeing numbers that high, there's probably direct sunlight reaching your test point somehow.  If the photocell is facing a window, that's possible.  If not, your model may have a light leak.

The file to read is /usr/share/doc/radiance/README.Debian
(that's the common filename if you're looking for Debian related changes
of packages, either README.Debian or README.Debian.gz in
/usr/share/doc/packagename)
If anybody is interested, you can also read it here:
http://git.recluse.de/?p=debian/pkg-radiance.git;a=blob;f=debian/README.Debian;h=75eb43346a9c9094197a4b312b7e9fd49548d238;hb=HEAD

The pdf files, examples and other documentation are packaged in the
radiance-doc package, if you're looking for the materials (needed for
the examples), install radiance-materials.

Thanks for the help so far everyone. But I also did get a chuckle from the
"double click the Radiance icon" comment from Rob G. :)

So I think I successfully installed Radiance, because the tools seem to be
responding, however I can't get very far into the tutorial

<http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/tutorial.html>

I created a text file with the exact parameters from the tutorial, but named
room2.rad (room.rad I messed up by opening it twice and editing while it was
still open elsewhere)

This is what I typed, and received from within Terminal:

nick@nick-desktop:~$ oconv room2.rad > test2.oct
nick@nick-desktop:~$ getinfo test2.oct
test2.oct:
    #?RADIANCE
    oconv room2.rad
    FORMAT=Radiance_octree

nick@nick-desktop:~$ rview -vp 2.25 .375 1 -vd -.25 .125 -.125 -av .5 .5 .5
test2.oct
VIM - Vi IMproved 7.1 (2007 May 12, compiled Jan 31 2008 11:53:56)
Unknown option argument: "-.125"
More info with: "vim -h"
nick@nick-desktop:~$ rview -vp 2.25 .375 1 -vd -.25 .125 -av .5 .5 .5
test2.oct
VIM - Vi IMproved 7.1 (2007 May 12, compiled Jan 31 2008 11:53:56)
Unknown option argument: "-av"
More info with: "vim -h"
nick@nick-desktop:~$

It seems as though when I use rview, the 8th parameter (-.125 the first time
I tried it, then for experiment's sake I took -.125 out, and then it said
"-av" was unknown) produces an error.

At your suggestion, I tried "rpict" with the same parameters as the "rview"
above from the tutorial, and Terminal spits back hundreds of lines of
unrecognizable characters to me. For example, this was the first line:

? ? ? ? ???? ?  ? ?
4??????????????????'?????
???(c)??(R)??????????????????????????????????????????(c)???????
? ? ?
4??????????????????'?????
???(c)??(R)??????????????????????????????????????????(c)???????
? ? ?

And still, no image of a ball, "You should start to see an image of a red
ball forming on your screen."

What step am I missing or not doing, that's not in the tutorial?

Thanks (again) in advance for the help.

Nick, you are almost there ;-)

rview's name changed to rvu. So call it again with

rvu -vp 2.25 .375 1 -vd -.25 .125 -.125 -av .5 .5 .5 test2.oct

Rpict gives out a picture, so the strange characters are what is 
happening if you write a picture to the terminal. Redirect output to a 
file and display it with ximage:

rpict -vp 2.25 .375 1 -vd -.25 .125 -.125 -av .5 .5 .5 test2.oct > image.hdr
ximage image.hdr

Or if you do not want to save the image but just display it, redirect 
the ouput to ximage using the pipe:

rpict -vp 2.25 .375 1 -vd -.25 .125 -.125 -av .5 .5 .5 test2.oct | ximage

I hope this helps a bit. Get used to input/output-redirection, which is 
described in all standard Linux tutorials. You should know the meaning 
of <, > and | in a unix-like system. Than introduce filters such as 
pfilt, ra_tiff, pcond. Than go on with modeling scenes, lights, materials.


Good luck!

Lars.

Dear all,

I'm simulating a 3*3*3m room, and have one window on one wall, does anybody
have similar experiences about how to get a good picture face to walls? I find

I do not know the parameters you used, but 0,0,0 means that most
probably you have no ambient calculation. As most parts of your room
will receive only indirect illumination, this will result in zero. Try
setting -ab to 2. To understand the effect of -ab for your scene, render
images of your room using -ab 0, -ab 1, -ab 2, -ab 3 with -av set to 0 0
0 for all renderings. You should see only a bright splotch of (direct)
sunlight for -ab 0, and increasing luminances for the areas receiving
reflected light with higher -ab bounces. Try it!

Also make sure to measure illuminance slighty OVER the plane - if you
are INSIDE geometry we all do not know what you will get for illuminance...

Best is if you imagine taking a picture with a camera in such an 
environment. I do not know if you have any experience as a photographer, 
but you would most probably use a wide angle lense, as the room is small 
and you want to see a perspective v?ew, not just one wall. Try something 
like -vh 90, which would open the horizontal field of view to 90 degree. 
Also, sketch a plan of your room, and mark view-point and field of view 
(which would be an angle at the viewpoint), so you can get an idea how 
much you can see of your room at a given point with a given lense.

This is much more about photography/sketching then Radiance.

You could use rvu and just play around, but it is still better to KNOW 
what you are doing ;-)

Good luck, Lars.

There are commands in rvu to rotate the camera around camera center (r),
around a center on an object surface (p), to move the camera (m) etc.
You should set a wider field of view as a command line parameter. When
you are happy, you save the view to a view file.

To be honest, I never felt that comfortable navigating in rvu. So I
choose a number of promising views (using my paper-and-pen-approach) and
do some previews, feeding the view parameters to rvu on the command
line. Usually I imagine where I want to stand, what should be in the
center of the image, etc, so I use rvu as a pure preview.

Of course you can also use any 3d-modeler to find camera position,
direction etc. IT should only be possible to define field of view (or
"focal length").

Hi, all,

  I'm trying to use ESP-r coupling Radiance to perform thermal integrating
daylight use simulation.

  And I have performed 7 days simulation with 1 hour timestep, which means I
got 168 illuminance numbers of one indoor test point. I find calculated
illuminances of 6 days is basically close to the measured data. But1 day is
exceptional, there is a big difference between calculated illuminances and
meaured ones. That1 day is a very clear sky because that day has a highest
direct and diffuse radiation of those 7days, but the measured illuminance is
much lower than other six days. Anybody can tell why? and how to modifiy?

Thank you for your time.

Hi,

it has been a while since I started radiance from inside esp-r. Can you
find out how to set the ab-parameter for the simulation? It is the
number of ambient bounces. I would set it to 3 in your case. Others
might suggest even higher values - you should increase it until there is
no real change observed any more.

Hi, Lars,

It seems you are professional in esp-r coupling radiance, so I have some other
questions,

for ESP-r, I set something in my casual gain control *.cgc file as follows,

illuminance set point, 320 lux,
switch off level, 150%
night calibration, 44.5 lux
control slope, -0.028

I think the light should switch off if illuminace is lower than set point 320
lux. but after simulation, from "zone casual gain trace file", I find light
switch off under the condition that illuminace is lower than 75 lux, why that?

what function does "switch off level, 150%" have?
and  what function does "control slope, -0.028" have?
and how to get the control slope number?

Thank you in advance.

Far from that ;-) So I am afraid that I cannot help too much. But for
the questions regarding gains definitions etc, you should use the esp-r
support lists.

>   

As much as I know, you must also define the operation parameters. Will
light be switched on 24 hours, or is it just that at night, light will
be off also at near-zero illumination? Where is the sensor - is it at
the same position you use for getting your illuminances? Or might it be
exposed to more light, so even when you see very low illumination, it
switches off because it receives more?

esp-r is a jungle of control files and parameters. I would always try to
model a "static" model first, e.g. get the illumination only by
sunlight. Next, switch on some lights. And than, when you have control
over the model, start experimenting with photocell-sensors, which will
dynamically switch on/off lights.


I haven't done much work with esp-r yet (though I am very interested in
it). So that is all I can advice. Did the higher -ab setting solve the
low illuminance problem?

Lars.

Hi

Not so far from expert as you think ;-), at least much closer than me.

I will try the -ab parameter. It should work well.

and thank you for your so long email.

How does ESP-r model the sky and how did you create the sky
for your Radiance scene? A clear sky has a different distribution
than an overcast sky and this could influence the illuminance
in your scene, especially if you're parameters for the ambient
calculation are too low (-ab option as mentioned by Lars).

As Lars wrote, first get an idea of the geometry you want
to see and find the coordinates for the view point and a
view directions. Once you have started rvu press 'v' and
fill in the view parameters (view point, direction, up,
angle, clipping). Repeat with small changes until you have
a nice view.

You can save the final view parameters but also the image
('W') to a file. The clipping is useful to create parallel
and perspective views that are physically impossible (eg.
a perspective of the interior of the room from the outside).

Read the man page for rvu. It tells you all the tricks.

Hi,

ESP-r calculate the indoor illuminance of a point with Daylight Coefficient
approach. I think its model should be no problem.

and I have another question,
if the sky and ground characters are determined and no indoor artificial
lights, then what will affect the indoor illuminance hugely? glass color,
glass transmitance, or interior face color of the wall?
my glass.rad file is as follows, the REG parameter 0.96 0.96 0.96 is key to
indoor illuminance?

hi ,all,

I create the first scence according to the "Scene 0 Tuterial", with rvu
command, I can see the indoor situation, and easy to identify where is floor,
cieling and wall because I can find the corner or common edge, though I set
the same color for them.

But unfortunately, when I create my own scence file, with rvu command it is
hard to  identify where is floor, cieling and wall, they look like the same
thing with no any corner or common-edge, I only can find where the window is.

does anybody could tell why that?

The only diffrence between the "Scene 0 Tuterial" and my own model is that my
model has only daylight without indoor artificial lights, but "Scene 0
Tuterial" has both.


Thank you.
ZZ

So you get an mkillum-modifier for the window pane usinf esp-r. This
brings up another idea - are you sure that the surface normal of your
window points to the inside of the room? If there is an illum used for
the window, actually a 0-illuminance is strange even with very low
ab-settings.

If you have indoor lighting, the light fall-off and, maybe, direction of
the light will underline geometry based on distance. Also objects will
create visible shades when between light and surfaces.

In your empty room, lid only by daylight (probably with a low -ab
setting and a set av-value, you did not tell us more about the
parameters you used), all surfaces will show the -av-preset brightness,
as they most probably do not receive direct light and the indirect is
not calculated. So it is hard to understand the interior, and there is
actually little calculation done.

Set -ab 2 and try again.

In general, for your questions, it is always important to post the whole
command line, e.g. rpict with all options and parameters! Without, we
are just guessing what you may have done.

Hi all,


I wasn't aware of the fact, that "our old" gendaylit had such a 
restrictive license!

We discussed that within our group and decided to simplify the license. 
 From now on, you can use it also for commercial products and it can be 
easily included in packages.
We only want to be acknowledged - which is similar to the RADIANCE 
license. Details: see README file of the package.

Hope this helps.

You can download the actual code (small changes included, that it 
compiles under linux and cygwin) including the revised  README  at:

http://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/radiance

For the evalglare users: Also a new version of evalglare is available at 
the same location. If you are using a version older than 0.6 you should 
update, some errors were fixed.


Cheers

Jan

non-free is not part of Debian officially. While I'd probably package
something for non-free if somebody would ask me to do it, I prefer to
stick with free software.

This sounds good, thanks a lot! Although I'd suggest for your own safety
(please note that I'm not a lawyer...) to
- require that the copyright information is kept in the files
- require that the *license* is not removed from the source. At the
moment you're alloweing me to share the files without any license
information...
- add a disclaimer which tells people that they can't sue you if your
software fucked up their system.. or so. Although I'm not a lawyer and
don't know if you need that or now, in my optinion it's better to have it.

While I appreciate free licenses, I'd still suggest to stick with a
license like the one radiance uses (which is the older BSD license) or,
if you're looking for a really free one, use the ISC license.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_license
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC_license


And the other question is: Does Greg want to include gendaylit into
Radiance, or would it make sense? With such a license this would be
possible.

Cheers,

Bernd

It is not possible like that. You can either install an emulator, which 
will emulate a x86-machine with linux, on your Mac and run it in there, 
or you have to convince the Daysim-folks to compile a universal binary 
for OS X. The problem is that Daysim is compiled for an entirely 
different platform (x86) then yours (ppc).

I run Dayim on a Macbook Pro (OSX 10.5 and on the earlier 10.4). Current

You run x86 software on x86 hardware. Tom has a ppc machine, so a 
virtual machine such as Parallels does not work.

Do you expect anyone to solve this for you if you ask in a general way 
like this? The question is not about radiance but about modelling in 
ecotect. Most probably it is not a problem of the software. We do not 
know / see the problem. A "light leakage" can be anything from a missing 
ceiling to a rounding error...

While I do not see that this is somehow related to Radiance, I think 
that dxf is simply a problematic format for model exchange. There are 
standards such as iges, step for cad, and for models/scenes vrml, x3d 
usually work well. dxf is a propietary format by Autodesk, they change 
it at will, do not expect other software to be able to support it perfectly.

To import (subset) dxf into radiance, there are several translators, but 
obj is better supported now.

The first thing to do is to identify the source of the problem. Why  
do you
suspect 'light leakage'? To high values for daylight factor?

First check your material definitions. If you have windows and your  
glass
material is incorrect too much light might enter the room through the
window panes.

If you think that the geometry is the problem try a few fisheye views  
of the
inside. Bright pools at the edges of walls/ceilings/etc. indicate a  
problem.
If the inside doesn't show anything, place a light source inside and  
render
views from the outside without sky.

There is no point in recreating a model if you don't know what was wrong
with the first one.

Please also post your questions in proper English and provide as much
information as you can. If you want us to take the time for meaningful
replies you should take the time to type an understandable question.

Thomas

Hi all, 

Does any of you wants to share an example of rpiece, using multiple (say 4) processes on a single machine, sharing 1 ambient file, resulting in 1 single image?

The manpage gives this example:

goober% echo 1 8 > syncfile
goober% echo -F syncfile -x 1024 -y 1024 -vf view -o picture octree > args
goo1ber% rpiece @args &

How do I let rpiece run 4 processes simultaneous? Just run 4 processes in the background?
How does an ambient file works using rpiece? Do I just need one, or as many as there are "pieces"?
Where are temporary files stored, so I can check their progress?

Thanks Jack, 
A brief question in line in return...

   Lastly you can do a pfilt on the unfinished image and view the results to visually see things. Files will be stored as you desire, so it is up to you to organize things the way you want.

I underestand that the -o option sets the final image.

Iebele,

The runsmp script contained in my Radiance benchmark tests 
demonstrates this. It's what I use to render my large art images.

http://mark.technolope.org/pages/rad_bench.html
http://mark.technolope.org/radmisc/bench4.tar.gz

Mark

PS. here's the script rewritten for 4 CPUs:
-------------
#!/bin/sh

[ -z "$NCPU" ] && NCPU=4
[ -z "$COLS" ] && COLS=1
[ -z "$ROWS" ] && ROWS=64

echo $COLS $ROWS > syncfile
rm -f pp

while [ "$NCPU" -gt 0 ]
do
         echo "running proc $NCPU"
         rpiece -v -PP pp -F syncfile @viewpoint @options @args &
         NCPU=`expr $NCPU - 1`
done
wait

rm -f syncfile pp

exit 0

Hello,

You can try our scripts which do exactly what you want:
http://www.bakharev.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=category&sectionid=5&id=23&Itemid=38&lang=english
In fact they're wrappers to rpict and rtrace and take the same options.

Best Regards,
Ilya

Anyone using a spectrophotometer to measure reflectances for use in  
Radiance?  Section 5.1.9 (p304-307) of the Radiance book shows how it  
can be done.  Is this method still used, and if so could you post/ 
email the scripts spct2xyz.csh and xyz2rgb.csh?

Any tips/pointers not already covered in Section 5.1.9 would be much  
appreciated.  We'll be using a Konica/Minolta CM-2600d portable  
spectrophotometer.

Hi John,

It is a long time ago that I experimented using a Minolta spectrometer, I 
think is was in 2000.
At that time I wrote and bundled some scripts and documents, I just put 
these on the server for you:
http://www.iebele.nl/radiance/callibrate/

Look in this document for "Minolta's spectro-photometer"
You will need these scipts/programs:

http://www.iebele.nl/radiance/callibrate/minolta.c ( just one of my own 
progs, ...)
http://www.iebele.nl/radiance/callibrate/spct2xyz
http://www.iebele.nl/radiance/callibrate/xyz2rgb


Because most of the page is written in Dutch, here a short help:
( spectraal-q14.txt  is a just a file from your spectrometer )

$ ./minolta < spectraal-q14.txt
 Convert Minolta photospectrometer spectral data list
 Ranging from 400 to 700 nm
 This data can be read by spct2xyz
 Number of steps in spetcrum  : 31
 Number of measured items     : 20
 Writing file Q14-0.spc 1
 Writing file Q14-1.spc 2
 ...
 Writing file Q14-19.spc 20

Now check the result:

$ more  Q14-0.spc
#nm      reflectance
400     0.728000
410     0.799700
...
700     0.933800

Now translate  *.spc files to .xyz and  .rgb line this:

$ ./spct2xyzQ14-0.spc >  Q14-0.xyz
$ ./xyz2rgb  < Q14-0.xyz >  Q14-0.rgb


I don't know if these scripts still work, or if they are accurate,
hope it helps you a little,

Iebele

Hi again John,

The file in mentioned in my previous mail, spectraal-tmtq14.txt,  is not 
obtained from the Minolta directly.
It is an edited spreadsheet from the Minolta (edited by hand). The input 
file for minolta.c should look like below, ie. only containing spectral 
data.

The first integer indicates how many samples are stored in the file.
The next integer indicates the actual sample, followed by a string, followed 
by all spectral values, in this case 31.

Hi Thomas,

Thanks for the feedback.
I was actually checking my model in radiance without any windows,wherein it showed me light leakage.Its just one corner of the building at which i can see some light ,which is around 250 lux, quite huge amount.
I deleted all my windows in ecotect and then exported the model in radiance, after so much analysis i could just find the corner from where the light is leaking.
I have attached the pictures here.

and I hope you find my english proper. :)

Dear Thomas and Harshada, 
we currently have also figured out a light leakage problem that occurs only when working with quite huge models. We did some analysis on that problem and found out the following:
 
If we measure the daylight factors in a simple box generated with genbox without any openings than rtrace gives us zero values for all measurement points as expected. 
 
If we than add an additional surface that is much bigger than the simple box and do the simulation again (without changing anything else), we receive light in the the completely closed box. We think, we are using appropriate values for -aa and -ar. The result of:  biggest_model_length * aa / ar is much smaller than the distance between the measurement points.
 
Maybe the solution for this problem is using mkillum instead of common windows. We keep on testing...
 
Regard, Kai.

	Hi Thomas,
	 
	Thanks for the feedback.
	I was actually checking my model in radiance without any windows,wherein it showed me light leakage.Its just one corner of the building at which i can see some light ,which is around 250 lux, quite huge amount.
	I deleted all my windows in ecotect and then exported the model in radiance, after so much analysis i could just find the corner from where the light is leaking.
	I have attached the pictures here.
	 
	and I hope you find my english proper. :)

		First check your material definitions. If you have windows and your glass

Hi Jack, 

Yes, it would be helpfull to have acces to the individual pieces. 
If you want to share your hack, I would be very pleased with that.

  Hi Iebele,

  All the "pieces" get written out into the file specified by the -o option. So there are no individual image pieces if that makes sense.

  To avoid some issues relating to speed of file locking for rpiece jobs shared over multiple compute nodes (such as in a cluster with a shared nfs server), I have actually hacked rpiece so that it will in fact write out the individual pieces as image files. These can then be assembled into the final image after the fact. I am willing to make this available if there is interest.

    I underestand that the -o option sets the final image.
    But where can I find the temporary files , i.e. the "pieces" ?

         Lastly you can do a pfilt on the unfinished image and view the results to visually see things. Files will be stored as you desire, so it is up to you to organize things the way you want.

There is interest...  =8-) 

On a related note, does anyone here have experience with Oracle's 
cluster file system (ocfs)?  My IT guy here thinks this filesystem might 
eliminate all the nasty file locking problems that have plagued rpiece 
on linux for years.  I was about to test this out myself when I get some 
free time, as we now have two nodes that are running it, but I haven't 
had a chance yet.

Radiance can show some unwanted light spots at the edges of polygons.
This is due to inaccuracies of the geometry generation and the  
interpolation
between two calculated points.

I have seen this in models where I only created a single polygon for  
a wall
instead of two polygons for inside and outside or where the floor or  
ceiling
was larger than the room space itself and extended into the exterior.  
If your
model is of this type try to build floor, walls and ceiling with real  
thickness.
This will create an exterior envelope around your room that should  
stop most
of the light. I have no idea how you can do this in Ecotect, though.

Hi everyone,

Thanks for your feedback

yup as Kai said ,,I have kinda huge model... so that can be one of the things which i need to check.
and one more thing is as Thomas said,I have modelled it without the actual material thickness.So i even have to check it with that.
Now I am just explaining what problem i have eaxactly.
I have a geometry of a building block wiith two wings ,modular. The wing from which I am getting light leakage is on east side.
So i tried copying the same geometry from west to east.
but the same geometry is perfect on west and if you place it on east it leaks light.

I know this is kinda long mail,,, but thanks for reading

In search of solution
Harshada

I can see the red ball centered on the screen, but no room and table.

How can I get genbox and xform to work?

(From my limited knowledge of Radiance/Ubuntu, I think I need to install

Hi Nick,

There was some conflict with "genbox" and an existing tool -- try  
"genrbox" or "rgenbox" -- it may have been renamed on your distribution.

Hi Nick, 

There was a conflict in the naming of several Radiance executables for Linux distributions.
I use a standard Radiance install of Debian, where genbox is renamed to genrbox:
/usr/bin/genrbox
You also might find "rview" being renamed to "rvu"

Good luck, 

Iebele

  Hello all,

  I'm following the tutorial: http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/tutorial.html
  ...and I receive this error:

  I can see the red ball centered on the screen, but no room and table.

  How can I get genbox and xform to work?

  (From my limited knowledge of Radiance/Ubuntu, I think I need to install these components, or unarchive them from the Radiance installation package)

  Thanks,

Hi all,

I have a model with about 40.000 polygons, each textured with a mostly 
transparant image (only about 1% of the texture is visable). Seen from the 
rendering viewpoint the polygons in the model overlap quite a lot, so one 
ray might have to "look" through about 50 "transparant" polygons or even 
more before actually "see" something. I think this is why this particular 
model renders amazingly slow, even with -ab set to 0, -st 0 and -lr 1. Is 
there another parameter in control that might speed up the rendering in such 
case?

Hi Iebele,

One of the slowest things in Radiance is the .cal file evaluations,  
so minimizing expression evaluations is the key to faster renderings  
in this case.  Having many surfaces for each ray, all having function  
evaluations, is bound to be slow.  Combining or eliminating such  
calls would help a lot.  I don't know enough about your situation to  
recommend "how."

Hi Greg, 
Ok, thanks. Good to know that this model indeed gets close too the limits. 
Makes it a lot easier to have a few more days patience with it.

Greg hi,

I got curious now when I hear about eliminating such calculations. As 
far as I know, I alsways have to at least rotate anything mapped that I 
want to appear on a non-horizontal surface. I can avoid scaling, 
mirroring etc by applying these tranforms to the images using image 
processing tools such as those coming with radiance. But for avoiding 
the rotation, I do not see a way (besides rotating the whole model with 
light sources and views instead of the images if e.g. I want to map most 
onto a vertical plane). So did you mean something like that when saying 
"eliminating such calls", or were you thinking about structuring them 
more efficient?

CU Lars.

This is obviously not a problem that could be solved by the Radiance 
folks here, but it seams that your apt-installation is broken. There are 
many ways to check why and how this is the case (the most basic would be 
to try to install any other package, maybe you cannot install anything 
at all?). Also working network connections not always mean access to 
apt-sources, e.g. if there is a firewall which blocks one machine and 
lets the others connect.

I just read over an abstract of a thesis by Chris Thorne on

It has some interesting thoughts on problems of scaling and accuracy in 
simulations. It may be interesting in Radiance world, so that is why I 
post the link here. A lot is about animation-related issues, but there 
are some more general topics of 3d models covered.

Hi Lars,

Although it helps up to a point to reduce the complexity of the .cal  
expressions, it's more important to minimize the total number of such  
modifiers in your rendering, since it's the overhead of the call  
itself that's most significant.  For example, adding a functional  
pattern to another functional pattern that uses a functional texture  
and surface normal interpolation and a mapped picture with its own  
(admittedly unavoidable) coordinate transformation, that's going to  
be a lot slower than combining all the patterns into a single  
precomputed image and having just one functional texture.

Since Iebele had many mixfunc calls, most of which rendered  
transparent, this cost quite a bit in overhead.  In many cases it's  
unavoidable, but bear in mind that any calculations using the  
function files, while wonderfully programmable, cost quite a bit in  
overhead (i.e., a few times the cost of a ray intersection) plus 2x  
or more longer than the equivalent compiled math calls.

Does this make sense?

-Greg

> Does this make sense?

Yes, it does ;-) thank you for the explanation Greg! You know that I 
have a model making rather intensive use of textures here (the Hagia 
Sophia model), and I was wondering if there were some techniques to 
apply for a speed-up. But as we do not combine cal-files at all, just 
map one image per object, I do not see such a possibility any more. It 
might make sense to have simplified colorpict modifiers doing the most 
frequently used transformations hard-coded, without calling to the 
cal-file interpreter - e.g. a colorpictxy, colorpict xz and colorpict yz 
modifier which would allow to do all mapping in orthogonal models 
without cal-files. But it would break e.g. xform for such modifiers, and 
create a mess in the scene language while few models really have a 
problem with too many mappings. So we have to live with slow mappings ;-)

BTW, as it is related to textures and came to my mind some days ago - it 
should be quite doable to modify the source of mkillum in a way that it 
outputs polygons with a prerendered ambient calculation mapped onto 
them, right? It would be one step towards a nice vrml/x3d-export from 
radiance scenes, as the x3d- / vrml-viewer could render the direct 
light, while the view-point independent ambient calculation would be 
left to radiance. The only problem would be the need of correct surface 
normals for the whole model.

I don't know if I would call this 'easy' -- you would have to mesh  
the surfaces in some way, which is not done by mkillum at all.   
Others have worked on similar converters, but I don't know how far  
they got.  Richard Gillibrand (formerly of Bristol Univ.) and his  
2003 workshop presentation springs to mind.  Here is a related  
earlier post, relating also to the presentation by Bernhard Spanlang  
in 2002.

Hope this helps.

I thought that calling rtrace for each supported surface type using a 
fixed resolution and writing the surface with a colorpict modifier 
linking to the generated pixel image would be enough? Of course this 
approach would be incredible slow for large models.

Renderparks supported this kind of export. But as it imported only mgf, 
not native radiance, all texture information was lost.

Well, maybe I imagined this being easier then it actually is...CU Lars.

Do you mean hard-coded in Radiance here? Such a feature makes sense to me 
also.
In my case the mixfunc for transparancy is consuming lots of rendering time. 
Although .cal files makes the whole system very flexible, some features are 
so commonly used that of course it would be great if these were optimized a 
bit. At the other hand I imagine that these kind of changes are not that 
easily done, if it is possible at all, in the first place.

The problem is that while adding such modifiers should be rather easy, 
they would break consistency in a couple of places. E.g. imagine a scene 
using a colorpict_xz modifier. Everything would be fine - until you run 
xform to rotate the scene. Xform would have to replace the optimized 
modifier now. And having two ways to do the same is always a mess to 
support. So I guess the rather few cases where this is needed do not 
rectify the trouble one would introduce in that case.

CU Lars.
