Subject: [Radiance-general] Problem installing radiance onto Mac
	OSX-Leopard: running trad
Message-ID: <000601c88274$e308a170$0d01a8c0@nest1>

Hello All,

Problem installing radiance onto Mac OSX-Leopard: running trad (I am a Linux
user)

We use Radiance in our undergrad classes in the 3rd year of both the
Architecture and Interior Architecture courses here at Curtin University in
Perth, Western Australia.

For teaching, I have authored a version Knoppix 5.1.1 with the radiance
software (radiance-HEAD-2007-02-15) pre installed for the students use. In
the PC labs, the students use vmplayer with the ISO image. At home, they are
free to burn the ISO image or download vmplayer from www.vmware.com and take
home the ISO file and appliance. For modelling software - SketchUP 6 (Pro or
Free) with T. Bleicher's su2rad plug-in and model_location1.0.rb plug-in for
those that use the SketchUP 6 (Free) version at home.

However, this year, a number of students have asked to install radiance on
their MAC notebooks - easy says I ...
1)	Download the MAC binaries from radiance-online.org
(rad3R8_macosx.tar.gz)
2)	Extract my additional resources
3)	Jump into terminal on the MAC (please bear with me - I don't have a
MAC to play with but am comfortable with Linux OS)
4)	Un-tar the binaries, extensions and my additional resources into the
users directory.
5)	Create a .profile with the additional PATH and RAYPATH directives.

So far no trouble in the 10 minutes between classes however I came unstuck
with the TRAD program - appears to run but bombs out with glob errors -
sorry don't have the student's machine here to give more information. What I
do know, is that unknown to the student, X11 was pre-installed as was some
version of wish. The OS version was Mac OSX Leopard.

On the Knoppix 5.1.1 trad runs happily with wish8.4 straight up on a clean
install.

Do any of the Mac users have suggestions as to running trad - a vital front
end in our teaching program? At this beginner's level, my students find the
trad GUI much more comfortable than the command line allowing them to
concentrate on learning and using radiance for lighting investigations in a
10 hour sub unit in the science unit. As we all know when using trad,
students will still need to use the command line at various points.

I have Tiger here but I see the same problem.

I just googled and man-paged a bit and it seems that wish is not started
correctly. If you can call wish directly with trad as argument and it  
works
that might be your problem, too. Try

	wish /usr/local/bin/trad    # or wherever trad is installed

This might be enough on it's own for you. If you want to allow students
to type simply 'trad' at the command prompt replace the #!/usr/bin/wish
line in trad with

	#!/bin/sh
         # the next line restarts using wish \
         exec wish "$0" "$@"

This is straight out of the man page. It starts the GUI but I haven't
used trad in a long time and I haven't tested if it crashes further down
the line.

Let your students test it. That's what they're there for.

It's been a while since I last installed Radiance - so memory may be  
hazy - but I believe you may need to create the /tmp directory and  
set permissions also.

PS.  X11 on Leopard is a little clunky.  If you start it from an X11  
icon in the dock, you may end up with two X11 icons.  Which doesn't  
hurt, but it is annoying nonetheless.  The workaround I stumbled upon  
was to drag the X11 application icon to the lower-left pane of the  
Finder (i.e. making a  shortcut X11 icon), and then starting X11 from  
that.

I know this is supposed to be fairly basic but needs clarification: I want to get lux readings from my pic files
When generating *.pic files (with -i option for irradiance) , viewing them with ximage and 
selecting a point with the ximage 'l' command gives me values that are clearly NOT lux values (values appear to be 1/10th of my expected lux measurement).
Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't the value in W/m2 at an efficacy of 179lm/watt? For daylight only or all irradiances? If so, what conversion to get lux values?

Steve

Dear Steve,

The 'l' command in ximage applies the 179 lumens/watt conversion  
factor, so if the input is a picture created by rpict with the -i  
option, you should be seeing lux values on your opaque surfaces.  If  
you are off by a factor of ten, then I would suspect the input values  
or the calculation are at fault.

Best,
-Greg

Greg,

Thanks for confirming the conversion factor..that was a the gap in my knowledge of radiance.  Now,  without getting into into sordid details, the scene pic in question has a skylight and some T5 direct/indirect lighting. From the rendered night and day pics all seems well with ximage's human exposure setting corroborating with what  I would expect. The daytime pic shows strong illumination on the  work plane but yields a 'lux' value lower than I expected (250 to 300). I did not use a secondary lightsource for the skylight.  With a night, with only the T5 luminaires (ies2rad in meters), which, from manufacturer's data and experience, should give a 300 to 500lux illuminance, gives me a reading approx. 40lux(?). 


I tried rtrace (courtesy of man pages) with ximage -t command on the daytime pic
$ ximage office-i.pic | rtrace  -h  -x  1  -i office2xx.oct | rcalc -e '$1=47.4*$1+120*$2+11.6*$3'
18.3891712
21.1014687
20.6663913
???

I like ximage's interactive features, but something may be missing in that pipe  to rcalc.





Im using radiance to better (re)present my interior designs but
feel out place here using scientific instruments for my art supplies


thnks always
Steve

Hi Steve,

A direct/indirect fixture needs an interreflection calculation for  
any level of accuracy.  I recommend setting -ab 1 on the rtrace  
command line, maybe even -ab 2.  This will take considerably longer  
to produce a result, but should be closer to what you expect if there  
is nothing amiss with your model.  The command you are using  
otherwise looks OK.

I'm a little surprised by the factor of 10, unless the fixture throws  
over 90% of its light towards the ceiling.

Dear Radiance Community,
I'm more a faithful reader (than writer) of this newsgroup due to more
common problems I had to deal with in the past. 
But in my current project the architect wants a horizontally fully
glazed roof for his atria. The roof height 
is 35m and due to sun protection reasons the roof should be fritted. 

The main design criteria is, that the fritting should be realized in a
way, that you can distinguish between shaded 
and alight areas on the floor. 

We did some very rough experiments and saw very weak edges between
shaded 
and alight areas. For the distance of 35 meters a shading element has be
at least 40cm wide to produce a distinguishable 
shadow on the floor. 

If I model this with Radiance the results show always very strong
shadows with very sharp edges and I can't see any expected diffraction
effects.

Sorry for the long introduction but my question is very short: Is it
possible to model this effect with Radiance?

Best regards,
Kai

Hi Kai,

Try rendering with -dj 0.7 or so.  If you are using rad, this can be  
done by setting PENUMBRA=True.

Kai,

And if you are really hard-core, you can approximate the single 
sun's disk with a number of smaller disks, filling the original. 
This helps smooth out penumbras cast by long shadows, I've found.

Of course, try the "-dj 0.7" first. That might be enough. You 
will, of course, need to render at several times your final, 
desired resolution, and reduce afterwards.

Radiance is actually free (and open source) software.  Sounds like 
you're running Windows, in which case you might want to check out 
Desktop Radiance, which is a windows version of an older variant of 
Radiance running behind an Autocad GUI.  Francesco Anselmo (a regular on 
this list) also maintains a set of Windows binaries based on the latest 
version of Radiance, but unfortunately that one does not include any of 
the graphical programs that you really need to start learning and using 
Radiance.

Hi,
   
  I'm new to Radiance and am trying to follow Scene 1 in Rendering With Radiance (1998).  However, it fails to produce the same results.  The following problems occured:
   
  ***
  Page 55 - I defined brown_satin_paint in the material1.rad file like what the book suggested in P.46.  When I tried to use the function "oconv", however, the following line appears:
   
  oconv: warning - (!genprism brown_satin_paint stool_leg_nw 4 ...... 0 0 2.5): empty file

  Page 55 - When I ran the "rview" function, either one of the following lines appeared:
   
  Unknown option argument: "-10"
  Unknown option argument: "-av"
  ***
   
  Is it that Radiance commands have been revised and the book becomes obsolete, or have I not installed the program properly (I run it in Fedora)?  Any suggestions on how I can learn Radiance more effectively? 
   
  Thanks a lot for your help!!

Radiance is actually free (and open source) software. Sounds like 
you're running Windows, in which case you might want to check out 
Desktop Radiance, which is a windows version of an older variant of 
Radiance running behind an Autocad GUI. Francesco Anselmo (a regular on 
this list) also maintains a set of Windows binaries based on the latest 
version of Radiance, but unfortunately that one does not include any of 
the graphical programs that you really need to start learning and using 
Radiance.

Be advised, there is no "radiance.exe" that you double-click and get a 
splash screen and a menu. Radiance is more of a collection of programs 
that you can string together to get various results. It's far from

Hi Kam,

Sounds like a path problem -- make sure that your PATH variable is  
set with the executable directory for Radiance appearing before  
others in the list.  The "rview" name has been taken over by the  
"vim" editor, so use "rvu" instead.  I don't know of a conflict with  
genprism -- this you should try running on the command line to see if  
there is a problem with its arguments.

Best,
-Greg

P.S.  For future, please don't copy the digest in your e-mail.  Thanks.

Problem solved

Thanks to those who posted suggestions and in particular Thomas
Bleicher.

To get trad running under leopard I did the following:
1) Renamed trad to trad-original
2) Created a new trad file with the following contents:
	#!/bin/bash

	exec wish ~/ray/bin/trad-original "$@"
3) As can be seen, the radiance system is located in the users home
directory, thus I also need to change the set radlib line in the
trad-original file to:
	set radlib ~/ray/lib/tcl

something like that, adding a texpic modifier. What do you need this

It should be possible with rtrace and the -on option.. and driving rtrace with vwrays as described in Axel Jacobs tutorials.. But I'm not expert and I never tried it.

Hi Lars,

I need it for importing the per-pixel normals into a program I am 
writing myself, which will estimate the scene illumination conditions 
from an image of a scene. I have a 3D model of the scene, I know the 
camera position and orientation relative to the scene, and from the 
camera I get the "measured reflected radiances". Given the per-pixel 
normal information I have developed a method for estimating the 
illumination conditions in the scene ... makes sense?

Best,
Claus

Claus hello,

sorry, but I was in a hurry and misunderstood your mail! My answer was 
for just the opposite way - using an existing image as a normal map in 
Radiance. For your application, go on with Lucio wrote and just ignore

Well, perhaps if you're going to do something 'fancy' (but no if you  
just want the illuminance).  As suggested, a command like this:

vwrays -ff scene.pic | rtrace -h -w -fff -on scene.oct > norm.dat

will write out a binary file of the normal at intersection for each  
pixel.

I'll own up to being intrigued.  The derivation of the "illumination  
conditions" at the pixel will be confounded by any deviation that the  
scene materials have from pure diffuse reflector.  In any case,  
you'll need to know what those diffuse reflectances are on a per  
pixel basis.  Can you expand a little on your method?

you'd have to backport them for Gutsy.
Not sure if Ubuntu has something like Debian's backports.org, if so, you
could ask the people there to build backports of the packages.

If anybody is interested in packages for Debian Etch, please let me know
(or even better, write a wishlist bug report to the debian bts).

Message-ID: <100441490803161533r25c1f9d5o56744b255cfa18bc@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

Greg was kind enough to leave this announcement to me, since it was me
who has been giving him a hard time over it. Thanks for implementing
this, Greg!

So here we go:

I have the honor to announce a new fisheye view type for Radiance. It
is called the 'stereographic' or 'planispheric' projection. It is
particularly useful for sun path diagrams, as commonly used in
daylighting and overshadowing studies. Yes, it's true: no more messin'
about with .cal files--it's a native implementation. The option to
rvu/rpict/trace is -vts.

I've put together a little comparison of the three fisheye views:
http://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/pickup/projections.pdf
This will eventually be merged into the Advanced Tutorial, but I don't
have the time for this right now.

If you feel like doing a little exercise with pen and paper (like our
students do), get a sun path diagram from here:
http://luxal.eu/resources/daylighting/sunpath.shtml,

and follow Andrew's the instructions on the SquareOne web site:
http://squ1.org/wiki/Sun-Path/Overshadowing

Good projections to you all

Axel

Message-ID: <15AEE4FA-1FAC-4B15-8F7A-CF28AB013F73@arcor.de>

Dear fellow polygon benders and ray wranglers.

I have updated the download version of my su2rad Sketchup to Radiance
exporter. All those who have downloaded it in the past are advised to
get the new version because of the bug fixes it contains. Many thanks
to those who have tested the script and reported success and failure.

Download link: http://su2rad.googlecode.com/files/su2rad_v00d.zip

Some noteworthy new features

   * export by group, by color or by layer
   * import of rtrace results into Sketchup (as 3D fields)
   * experimental material library feature
   * experimental luminaire/geometry replacement feature

Please be aware of the experimental state of this script. The exported
scenes still contain the occasional error and you should always verify
the created geometry.

I have also bundled a small script that replaces the 'locations' dialog
(Sketchup Pro feature) on Google Sketchup. It has no database of country
and city coordinates but it allows the simple setting of longitude and
latitude values for the model. If you're only interested in this script
you can get the Ruby file here:

location.rb: http://su2rad.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/location/location.rb

I haven't updated the online documentation yet but the features should
be easy enough to understand without it.

Have fun!

Hi all!
Sorry for my bad English. I'm a quite new user of Radiance and I'm
interested in energy performance of buildings. I would like to know if
it is possible to calculate the performance of a shading system
(venetian blinds, light shelf, etc.) in terms of reducing solar
radiation. Does Radiance consider all the spectrum in calculating
irradiance? My aim is to try different shading systems in a office
room and to analyse their bahaviour in terms of shading coefficient.
Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance,
Valeria

Hello all,

I'm trying to simulate the occurrence of direct beam convergence; where 
sun hitting a concave, east facing, glass facade is redirected to form a 
"hot-spot" on the ground plane.  I have a photograph, and the time 
taken, of the building in question forming a hot spot as well as a 3D 
model. Using the "mirror" material type I can get an approximate 
facsimile, but not with the "glass" material. I've tried the glass using 
"mkillum" and setting -ar 0 but I still can't "fry" those ants. 

I'm under the impression that Radiance only considers the glass' 
reflected diffuse component, and not the direct (although I can see the 
sun's reflection in the glass)?  While close, I don't believe the 
"mirror" material will give the accuracy we're looking for due to the 
difference in effect the angle of incidence has on the amount of light 
redirected off the two materials.  Any thoughts, advice or observations 
would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.and regards.

Hi Chris,

Radiance doesn't find the illumination of the sun off the glass  
material because the sun is too small to locate with random (Monte  
Carlo) sampling.  The "mirror" type is the one to use, and you can  
account for the effect of angle on reflection by including an  
appropriate brightfunc pattern.  Assuming standard 88% transmittance  
glass, this would be:

void glass glass_alt_mat
0
0
3 0.96 0.96 0.96

void brightfunc glass_angular_effect
2 A1+(1-A1)*(exp(-5.85*Rdot)-0.00287989916) .
0
1 0.08

glass_angular_effect mirror glass_mat
1 glass_alt_mat
0
3 1 1 1

The Fresnel approximation for unpolarized light was lifted out of src/ 
rt/normal.c.  To change the reflectance of your glazing, you have to  
change both the glass_alt_mat definition and the 0.08 normal  
reflectance value in glass_angular_effect.

Hope this helps.
-Greg

Hey Axel,

Very kewl new fisheye feature and even kewler website with sunpath and shading diagrams.  Thank you.

Can you please explain how the "planospheric" fisheye projecting differs from the "-vta" angular fisheye project with "-vh 180"?

Thanks,

Dear all,

Greg was kind enough to leave this announcement to me, since it was me
who has been giving him a hard time over it. Thanks for implementing
this, Greg!

So here we go:

I have the honor to announce a new fisheye view type for Radiance. It
is called the 'stereographic' or 'planispheric' projection. It is
particularly useful for sun path diagrams, as commonly used in
daylighting and overshadowing studies. Yes, it's true: no more messin'
about with .cal files--it's a native implementation. The option to
rvu/rpict/trace is -vts.

I've put together a little comparison of the three fisheye views:
http://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/pickup/projections.pdf
This will eventually be merged into the Advanced Tutorial, but I don't
have the time for this right now.

If you feel like doing a little exercise with pen and paper (like our
students do), get a sun path diagram from here:
http://luxal.eu/resources/daylighting/sunpath.shtml,

and follow Andrew's the instructions on the SquareOne web site:
http://squ1.org/wiki/Sun-Path/Overshadowing

Good projections to you all

Axel

Hi Valeria,

This is probably one for the FAQ (if only there was a FAQ)...   
Radiance has a preferred color space, but it does not require that  
you use it.  You can assign the three (RGB) channels to be anything  
you like, including total solar transmission/reflectance/whatever.   
Bear in mind that solar heat gain is also affected by thermal  
conductance and convection, which are not considered in an optical  
ray-tracing calculation such as Radiance.  To the extent that IR  
behaves as visible light, however, Radiance may be trusted.

I hope this helps.

> thank you for your reply!  How can I change the contents of the channels?

You do not have to "change" them, you must enter the values for any 
simulation anyway. Define three channels you need, and enter them just 
as you would do with red green and blue values in their corresponding 
fields when defining reflection, transmission and emission of your 
surfaces. Of course you must know the properties of you sources and 
surface materials for these channels. The point is that in your mind, 
you have to replace the meaning of the RGB-values, usually taken as 
RedGreenBlue, with Channel1Channel2Channel3. Colors are just "channels" 
of radiance in this meaning, so just change the wavelength and you can 
use it for anything ;-)

Of course as Greg already wrote you should consider if the effects of 
radiance that are modeled in Radiance are enough or if you need other 
energy transports for your work, too.

CU Lars.

Hmm, I thought I'd done that in the PDF. Typically, all fisheye
projections are used with a -vh and -vv of 180. The difference is the
projection of the hemisphere onto a flat surface. Let me know where

Axel,
 
Just out of curiosity, in your projections.pdf document, the fish eye views show a scene that is mirrored on the top and bottom of the image.  Why is this?  If the view is looking straight up, I would think there would only be one building, one arch, one fountain, etc..  Also, the bottom of the image is darker than the top.  Can you explain?
 
Thanks

Yes!! Really thank you Greg and Axel !!!

Then, I would like to ask a question. 

I'm in need of representing in Radiance a shiny peinture. And I've no idea on how to measure or where to collect appropriate values for specularity and roughness. 

Does exist any library? The libraries I know have only lambertian peintures. 

How could those values be calculated? Or, better: how could them be estimated? What I need to do is to choose reasonable values and justify them in my thesis.. Any suggestion?

Thank you in advance!

I thought some of you may be interested in this. HiPerWall just 
recently displayed a 32k x 32k image that I made with Radiance. A 
lower-resolution print was on display at SIGGRAPH 2006, and I

Hey Mark,

That is awesome!

How did you generate the geometry? How did you decide how to light the 
scene? How long did your scene take to to render?

Yeah Mark, that is really cool, as usual.  Your stuff stands as one  
of the most interesting applications of Radiance, physics, and art.   
I love it.  And like Jack, I'd love to hear more about the process of  
generating and rendering the model, if you have time to share!

Is there a version we can view?

That is pretty amazing, really - a testament to Radiance and your

Jack, Rob,

I did a short talk about building the piece at SIG06, and again 
(with a little more detail, and more production images) to an art 
group here in Boston last year. Here are both PDFs:

http://mark.technolope.org/image/sketches_0621_Mark_Stock.pdf
(start at page 10)

http://mark.technolope.org/image/talk_collusion/collision_talk_5.pdf
(start at page 35)

In summary:

> How did you generate the geometry?
My fluid PhD code made the underlying mesh, a simple custom 
program created an open-topped box above every triangle.

> How did you decide how to light the scene?
I wanted an alien sky, so I used my skycolor.cal file with a pink 
zenith and colder (bluish) horizon. Actually, there must have 
been an error in the .cal file, because the horizon is pretty 
noisy. I didn't fix it because it added some nice, odd colors to 
the polygons that were facing down.

> How long did your scene take to to render?
602 hours. I think I spread the job across two single-core 
machines that I have here at home.

Hi Thomas,

There seems to be a problem with this new version.  When I export, it 
creates a bunch of materials but names them all "default_material".  
Perhaps the new material library function is causing this?  Is there a 
way to get the previous version back?  On the google site, you have a 
ver_c but you also made a ver_d prior to the current one, which worked 
great for me.  I hope you still have that earlier ver_d, because I 
overwrote mine and this one doesn't work for me yet and I was hoping to 
use your script this week! 

Let me know, and thanks for updating it.  Maybe I'm just not using the 
material library function properly?

- Rob

I couldn't reproduce Rob's problem here but there is a situation
where something similar happens (semi-)intentionally:

In 'by layer' export the script uses the layer of the polygons
to define the material. I assume that most imports from CAD will
keep the layer assignment as it was and so you could use this
to create layers like 'concrete', 'wall internal', 'wall external'
which after the export would be assigned to materials of the same
name (or the Radiance save version with spaces replaces by '_').

At the moment the only thing the exporter can do is to create a
dummy material file with all of these layer/material names aliased
to the default material. Hence the unmodified export will be grey.
You now should use the references in the 'material.rad' file to
create your own material file. The simplest way is to replace it
with a standard file that contains default material descriptions.
As long as your layer names match the material names this should
work out of the box.

I was planning to add a function to read existing material files
and use the definitions in this file. However, for that I have to
write a parser for Radiance syntax in Ruby and that's not at the
top of my TODO list right now.

I do not remember a previous v00d but I referred to everything since
v00c as 'v00d'; it just never had a release date next to it.

You can go to the google code site and check the existing revisions
here:

	http://code.google.com/p/su2rad/source/list

Then you can use any SVN client to get the revision you want or
use your web browser to get them individually.

> Maybe I'm just not using the material library function properly?

The only thing you could do right now is place a Radiance material
file next to the material's '*.skm' file in your Sketchup installation.
The content of this file would be use instead of the replacement
so the names have to match! It's not my preferred way to handle
materials but it was possible without 'understanding' the contents
of the file and therefore quick and easy to do.

NOTE: I have found another problem with the material assignment
       that causes the rendering of the scene to fail due to missing
       material definitions. This happens with the 'by color' mode
       and is fixed in the current SVN.
       I also noticed that the 'by color' mode does not behave as
       it's supposed to do. This might be related to components and
       therefore not such a problem but I see that I have to work on
       this for a while before a 0.1 release.


Anyhow, I hope it still helps some of you out there.
Thomas

Hi Lucio,

I'm sure there are better, newer references out there, but here's a  
place to start:

	http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/sg96crs.pdf

A quick google search of the terms "radiance materials library" led  
to some online material from my old friend Kevin Matthews:

	http://www.designlaboratory.com/computing/tools/radiance/radmatlib.html

There are some dependencies on some .cal files, which you may have to  
find elsewhere.  I know we worked on something like this at the LESO/ 
EPFL, but I don't know what became of it.  I don't think much was  
done with collecting specular materials.  You can find almost  
anything you like out there in the big wide world, so a library will  
never be more than a random sample.

Best,
-Greg

I have looked for years to find those cal files.  I believe I emailed  
Arifice and/or Kevin directly many years ago for "dusty.cal", to no  
avail.  Anyone who has or obtains these cal files that's willing to  
share, I'll buy you a beer.

Dear Radiance users,

I thank you very much for your reply to my prior posted question on external shading (glass). 
I do have one questions on the trans material. Since I do not have any data on the transmitted specularity Ts,  it then proper to use 0,5 for a two sheet laminated glazing with 60% or 70% printing or????

Another question. Which material is proper to use for light shelves (e.g. MDF with a reflectance of 95%)?


Best regards

Per Haugaard

Emne: Re: [Radiance-general] External 'clear' shading

Corrections -- I was a little fast and sloppy on this:

A6 = (Td + Ts) / (Rd + Td + Ts) = 0.23 / (0.30 - 0.08 + 0.23) = 0.511
A5 = Sr = 0
A4 = Rs = 0.08
A3 = A2 = A1 = Rd / ((1-Rs)*(1-A6)) = (0.30 - 0.08)/((1-0.08)* 
(1-0.511)) = 0.489

yielding:

void trans fritted_glass
0
0
7 0.489 0.489 0.489 0.08 0 0.511 0.5

I don't understand why people find trans so confusing...

Hi Brine,

As far as I know desktop radiance only works with Autocad 2000, If you are
trying to install the same on Architectural desktop 2005 It will not work
for my experience too. If you are using a Windows OS , there are
some binaries written, you might want to check
http://www.bozzograo.net/radiance/index.php  by Francesco Anselmo. they are
very very helpful. If you have questions you can call me at 480.544.4936. I
live in tempe.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Pattern on tilted surfaces
Message-ID: <FE872D9C4591BF44AAFD986BF73368FF029952D8@webmail.transsolar.com>

Dear Radiance Community,
first I want to thank Greg and Mark for their helpful hints concerning
my soft shadow problem. Both ways worked very well (using jitter = 0.7
or sligthly disslocated suns).
Now I'm facing a new problem. I want to simulatate a window with a
pattern for sun protection. In the archive I found something like the
following:

void plastic-10 pattern_10
0
0
5 .1 . 1 .1 .03 .02

void mixfunc pattern_round 
4 pattern_10 void result r_hole.cal 
0
2 .003 .002


This is the r_hole.cal file:

{
  square holes
  A1 = length
  A2 = distance
 
}

a=A1+A2;
result=if(zhole,0,1);
next_dotx= a /2-mod(U,a);
next_doty= a /2-mod(V,a);
zhole=if(sq(arg(1)/2)-sq(next_dotx)-sq(next_doty),1,0);


pattern_round polygon window_with_pattern
0
0
12
......


This functions works properly for vertical and horizontal surfaces. For
tilted surfaces the pattern is getting smaller all the more you tilt a
vertical to a horizontal surface. I tried to play around the r_hole.cal
file but I was not  able to figure out, what screw I had to rotate.
Hopefully, there is someone out there who can give me a hand.

Thanks and best regards,
Kai

I think the simplest way is to keep the pattern material definition  
and the
window (vertical or horizontal) polygon in one file and then move and  
rotate
this file into place with xform:

!xform -rx 20 -t .... window_and_pattern.rad
!xform -rx 30 -rz 45 -t ... window_and_pattern.rad

There are some .cal files out there that allow a rotation argument  
but you
have to define every angle of the glazing as a separate pattern.

Subject: [Radiance-general] DF calculated in Radiance and Relux
Message-ID: <111603.49757.qm@web26614.mail.ukl.yahoo.com>

Dear Radiance Users,

In order to double check the DF which I calculated in Radiance I also calculated these for the exact same room with all the same settings (reflectance, transmittance, dimensions, areas of the pane, reference plance, reductions factor = 1 in Relux and city (Oslo)) in Relux . 

Surprisingly since Relux is based on Radiance the DF which I calculated in Radiance are about 1.7 higher than the ones calculated in Relux (DF calculated in Radiance = 17 and the ones calculated in Relux = 15,3 0.6m from the facade).

I have used the folowing gensky and rtrace command in Radiance:

gensky
6 21 12 -c -a 59.9 -o -10.8 -m -15.00 -B 55.866

rtrace -w -h -I+ -ab 20 -aa 0.1 -ad 512 -as 64 -ar 128 DF_OfficeLL.oct
< DFcoordinates.inp | rcalc -e
'$1=($1*0.265+$2*0.670+$3*0.065)*179/10000*100' > OfficeLL.log

The same issue arrise when I include external shading (trans) to my model?

Does anybody has any insight of the calculation settings in Relux or have I made a beginners mistake of my input in Radiance?

I appreciate any help and comments on this :)
  
  
Best regards 
  
Per Haugaard

Are you sure Relux is based on Radiance? According to my knowledge  
only the visualisation
add-on 'Relux Vision' is Radiance based. The calculation part uses  
another approach (radiosity
I think).

Anyway a difference of 70 % is something to worry about. I have  
compared Dialux with
Radiance in the past and the results differed by 10-15%. Have you  
double checked your
geometry?

'-ab 20' - impressive! I usually don't go higher than 6. If your  
afraid of missing some
tiny value in the third decimal you should use '-av' to set a  
background value. One
way to find this is described in RwR using rvu, another is to check  
the output of the
gensky program for the 'Ground ambient level' and adjust that for  
your indoor situation
(1-2% of the outdoor level).

If you have a detailed geometry (small windows and openings) you  
should also
increase '-ad' (4096), '-ar' (512) and '-as' (256). The speed penalty  
here is less than
that of an increase in '-ab' so I tend to be pretty bold about these.

I have noticed that Radiance seems to add to your rtrace results the  
higher you
set your '-ab'. I'd have expected the values to approach an upper  
limit where a further
increase makes no noticeable difference. In reality I could add a  
significant percentage
to the DF simply by increasing the '-ab' value. So I assume that your  
extreme
difference might be a result of the very high '-ab' setting.

Dear Thomas and other Radiance users,
Thank you very much for your reply. I used the following rtrace command instead:


rtrace -w -h -I+ -ab 6 -aa 0.1 -ad 1026 -as 256 -ar 512 DF_OfficeLL.oct < DFcoordinates.inp | rcalc -e '$1=($1*0.265+$2*0.670+$3*0.065)*179/10000*100' > OfficeLL.log
which reduced the calculated DF in radiance to pretty much match the ones calculated in Relux. 
Then I changed the transmittance for the glazing from 0,72 to 0,58 and made a new octree and re-calculated the DFs. I here after used the above rtrace command. 

However, this had no influence on the calculated DF at all. I have also tried to alter the '-ad', '-as' and the '-ar' with limit results.


How can that be?
Below I have listed my window.rad command:
#
# An emissive window

               2.1           16.8         2.5

The data used for the pane with a transmittance of 0,72 is similar exept from void glass window_glass wich is set to 3 0.78 0.78 0.78.

Since there should be nowhere else where I should change the settings for the zone when I alter the transmittance, how can the daylight
factors be similar for to dirrerent types of panes???
I apreciate any input on this.





Best regards
Per Haugaard

Message-ID: <47F0C242.8000709@poczta.fm>

Dear Group

I use Radiance for a few years, and I handled with different problems so 
far. Now I have to complicated problem and I need some help. I engage in 
energy transport in participating media (rtrace with parameter ?me).

As I read in ?Rendering with Radiance? value of expression
L(s) = L(0)*ext-(kappa*s)	(assume albedo omega=0)		(1)
is computed ?after all the ray-surface interactions? (page 591-592)

Is this formula computed for each ray, and then values connected with 
all rays are added? (it seems to me it is) Or maybe first values for all 
rays are added and after expression (1) is computed?

I need for my algorithm data connected with single ray: the value L(0) 
and distance s.

I tried to use rtrace with some options (all parameters are presented 
below ? file: render_h.opt):
- ?-otl? ? to get the distance from origin to object (s), but I?m not 
sure if s = l (l ? effective length of ray)
- ?-otv? ? to get value of each ray traced, but I get a table of zero 
values (something is wrong, I don?t know what)

Is this possible to compute L(0) and s (for each ray traced) using 
rtrace with some options at all? (I tried to analyze source codes of 
Radiance programs to find out it, but I?m not a programmer and it?s to 
complicated to me to understand it)


Best regards
Marcin Gawronski

Still doesn't explain why a very high '-ab' value results in a DF  
that doesn't look right.

I always thought that Radiance would produce more accurate results  
the longer it runs.

Without knowing the geometry it's hard to say. If your windows are  
the only openings
you should see a reduction in the DF. It's also possible that your  
window polygons are
not where you expect them to be. If you're on a Unix system you can  
use rvu to get
a visual impression of the room and with the 't' keystroke you can  
trace a ray to it's
intersection with the geometry. It tells you which polygon and  
material you've hit.
You can use it to verify your material changes are now part of the  
new octree.

Under Windows you can render a picture to control that the windows  
are in place.
To get an equivalent of the 't' you could use rtrace with a carefully  
selected origin and
direction and a modified output option.

These options will only have an effect if your geometry is very  
detailed and you
might miss a window with the initial '-ad' setting. Given the window  
polygons
below I'd say you have a few very large windows, so you don't have to  
change
these values.


Hth,
Thomas

Message-ID: <25992649.1207016470668.JavaMail.root@elwamui-wigeon.atl.sa.earthlink.net>

Hello All-

I have been trying out Simon Crone's beautiful sky images, and can't find the right syntax to map both illuminance distributions and these images to a sky source.

Simon advises:
"These sky environments do not deal with any sky illuminance
distributions as they are simply mapped colour images.  You can 
use gensky etc. to further modify these sky environment."

so, how can I combine:

void colorpict sky_map
7       red green blue midday.pic  skymap.cal map_u map_v
0
1	.5

sky_map glow sky_mat
0
0
4  1 1 1 0

sky_mat source sky
0
0
4  0 0 1 180

with:

!gensky 4 1 +12.00 -i -a 42.44 -o -76.5 -m 300

skyfunc glow sky_mat
0
0
4   1 1 1 0

sky_mat source sky
0
0
4  0 0 1 180

I gather  this is a problem of applying multiple modifications to a single composite material?

thanks a lot!
