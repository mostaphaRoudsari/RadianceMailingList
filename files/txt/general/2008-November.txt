Message-ID: <3EC944427F87D84793DBBC4137A2B5AD4CD82E@to1exc02wp.halsall.com>

Hello All,

 

I am trying to compare the difference in glare given off a building
after a cladding retrofit (from the perspective of occupants in
neighboring buildings). The original curtain wall cladding is a
white/grey marble and glass spandrel panels with a white patterned frit
are proposed for the retrofit. This is my first time using the software
and I am using Radiance in IES' Virtual Environment Program. 

 

I have some questions about determining/selecting material properties,
specifically deciding what material type (plastic/metal) and secularity
to use for the two cladding options. 

 

 

My assumptions:

 

Marble - Originally white, but panels have become grey with dirt over
time, not polished, dull finish

Type:                Plastic

Colour:             (0.91, 0.91, 0.83) 

Specularity:       ?????? (I think this may be low because it is not
polished marble)

Roughness:      0.05 (???) 

 

 

 

Glass Frit - Composed of: Clear glass, 60% coverage white frit, clear
glass, 100% coverage white frit. From Window 6, I estimate the solar
reflectance of the system to be around 25-35%. 

 

Typle:               Metal ??? (Does the frit have specular and diffuse
reflection of light?)

Colour:             (1.0,1.0, 1.0)

Specularity:       ????? (Clean polished glass)

Roughness:      0.00

 

 

If anyone has information from doing a similar simulation or has any
suggestion on what specularity values I should use to model these
materials it would be very much appreciated.

 

 

Thanks, 

 

Nastassja

Message-ID: <694e132c0811040827l36c100afsf28cb6c44939e035@mail.gmail.com>

Hello raytracers,

I've occasionally come across object clipping in some parallel views
without setting any clipping plane. I've always assumed that the
camera for parallel views was at infinity and everything in the scene
was visible to it. I've included an example below that clips the
corner of a rectangle. Is there a workaround to this, say, a simple
conversion to a parallel view from very far away? Am I overlooking
something? I'm using Radiance 3.8, by the way.

Thanks in advance. Cheers,
--Dave

your viewpoint is inside the box, which is why you're experiencing 
clipping even with no clipping plane specified.  Just "back up" a little 
bit in your -vp specification, and you should be all good!

Everything in front of the camera, yes. The camera plane cuts through
the rectangle and only the parts in front of the plane are shown.

The simple solution is to set the -o clipping plane to a negative value.
In your example '-o -8' is enough to show all of the rectangle.

For a view spec without clippings you have to add the inverse of your
view direction to your view point until everything is shown. Basically
you're moving the camera backwards but for a parallel view there is
no difference.

Thomas

Probably much darker than that, perhaps as low as 0.5.  You can  
estimate its reflectance with a camera with a telephoto lens (or a  
spot meter) and an 18% grey card; procedure at <http://www.kodak.com/global/en/consumer/products/techInfo/am105/am105kic.shtml

I don't have any good ideas for frit glass--perhaps the manufacturer  
has some information?

Rob and Thomas,

Ah, I was visualizing a sphere at infinity, centered on -vp with a
camera on the sphere pointed in the direction of -vd as opposed to a
plane within the model at -vp, with a normal of -vd that casts out
parallel rays. I misinterpreted the phrase "center of a parallel
projection" in the rpict man page for -vp. I guess the plane version
makes more sense when you start to throw clipping planes into the mix.
A negative -vo clipping plane an interesting concept, I hadn't
considered that.

I was looking at views from the sun, so I just subtracted a huge
multiple of the -vd vector from the -vp position and everything worked
out well.

Thank you very much,

--Dave

As Randolph wrote this is far too 'white' for a typical white material,
especially if it's a bit dirty.

0.75 throughout would be the colour of white wallpaint, so dirty marble
might be in the range of 0.6 to 0.65 (just a guess).

Specularity and roughness have an impact on the visual appearance
but have no effect on glare in the Radiance model.

Why don't you start with a glass material? If the frit is on the inside
you have at least one surface that will produce specular reflections
and might cause glare. A glass material would simulate that to some
degree. You can simulate the colour and transmittance with a trans
material behind the glass.

If you are interested in glare from reflected sunlight you should also
consider a 'mirror' material to trace the sun position more accurately.

Hi Cw,

The default behavior is output of one pixel value per line, that is 
"interleaved" rgb value:

rgb
rgb
rgb
.....

 The +n switch merely explicitly specifies interleaved output.

There is one small library file distributed with radiance 
(materials.rad), and there are some on the radsite ftp server.

Still - in most cases you will not be able to use generic material 
values but need information from a specific sample!

Hi,

there are several ways, most of them described in Detail in the book 
"Rendering with Radiance" which dedicates one chapter to the topic. 
There are more or less three ways, first guess and compare, second 
calibrated exposures, third specialized measurement devices. The choice 
depends on both required accuracy (in many applications, the overall 
brightness is much more important then color) and, of course, budget ;-)

If you've got a sample of the color, sure--you do colorimetry and  
convert the values from the colorimeter's color space to the Radiance  
color space. It takes some care to choose the sample, however.

> Secondly is there any library of materials to choose from ..?

We wish! Developing one, or tools to generate them from other data is  
a project that so far has not been addressed.

I concur with the others that this reflectance is too high for any  
surface that has been exposed to the exterior for a period of time.   
My experience is that dirt & grime reduce reflectance values by a  
significant amount.  I would suggest a reflectance of 50-60% for  
white marble.  The specularity is probably around 0.01 and a  
roughness of 0.08 for an unpolished surface is a reasonable guess.

Message-ID: <0003A3FE.4912A89E@192.168.0.81>

I have been thinking about a material library/editor for a while too. For many  needs it would be probably sufficient to have a basic database with the simpler materials (plastic, metal, glass,...) but as soon as it comes to more complex/combined materials the task of providing a useful interface becomes more of a challenge. Schorsch has addressed this with his material editor in Rayfront but this is not targeting beginners. I think that for many users it would be just fine to have something similar to the colorpicker tool (http://www.luxal.eu/resources/radiance/cp4r.shtml), maybe extended with the functionality of adding at least your own custom textures (image uplaod) to basic materials. 
Anyway, as a start it might be worth thinking about a central web based material depository where we all can share our own creations. The display format can be a simple list with mat, cal, pic files and a little preview.
Anyone interested in starting that? 

Regards,
 Erwin

Maybe one should first consider a database of measured values. Based on 
this, one could implement a material editor that could query that 
database and give a radiance material definition as a result. The 
advantage is that I could compile the material data available into a 
description fitting the needs of my specific application. It is 
important to keep in mind that our measurements and simulations not only 
have a degree of accuracy but also a scale. A material for a wall of 
bricks is not only depending on exterior influences (dirt, humidity, 
vegetation) but also on the scale we look at it - from far a way it will 
be sufficient to define it as one uniform color, sampled e.g. over 
2mx2m, from a close point of view I would want to have a brick texture 
including the different colors of brick and mortar, and for a detail 
view I would need the color and structure of only the brick itself, as 
the mortar would be a different material. Just one very simple example, 
other materials are much more difficult. Still sharing the measured 
values (including very detailed descriptions of object and set-up) would 
be very useful for the secondary materials, those that a simulation not 
really focuses on and could be approximated. Think I would be interested 
in contributing.

There is a site in Japan doing something rather similar:
http://arch.xtr.jp/radiance/mat_database.htm
Just pipe it through an on-line translator. There are a handful of
different pages. It seems that all examples are from freely available
example models and mailing list posts.

Hey Axel,

Thanks for this, some of these look nice, but rely on non-standard .cal 
files.  Do you happen to have those?  I can't find a link to them on 
that site.

Jack,

Forgive my ignorance on the topic, but how do you convert those 
values to something that looks right in Radiance? I've tried just 
using RGB values like the ones from the site, but everything is 
simply too bright. And scaling them down uniformly seems to 
change the hue.

Mark,

That's where gamma values come in. Let's say the RGB values of a paint
sample from EasyRGB are (125,150,175), a blue gray. Take each channel,
divide by 256, take the result to the power of 2.2 (monitor gamma) and
then multiply by 256.

R = (125/256)^2.2 * 256 = 52.9
G = (150/256)^2.2 * 256 = 79.0
B = (175/256)^2.2 * 256 = 110.9

If you put the resulting values (52.9,79.0,110.9) in as the R G and B
material colors, you should get the correct paint color in your
simulation that matches the physical paint color.

Hi Dave,

As Mark already said, these values seem very bright to me also.

Once I did some measurements on a Kodak grayscale chart (from the good 
old Q-14 color separation guide) using a photospectrometer from Kodak, 
which results were all below 1.0 for each Radiance RGB triplet (see the 
attachment, which contain the conversions of the measured xyz-values to 
radiance rgb ). Since then my idea has been that rgb triplet values for 
diffuse reflectances above 1.0 are invalid. Reading your mail I get 
confused a bit.

Another point I don't understand is why you suggest to use gamma 
correction within a material description. I always think of gamma to be 
applied after the simulation has been done. In other words, I think of 
gamma to correct an image for a certain output device. So, why should we 
correct reflection values with a gamma _before_ a simulation?

The idea of a public database for materials, paints etc. dedicated to 
Radiance would be very usefull. Imho such a database would be very 
valuable as a part of the Radiance distribution also. This instead of 
pointing to websites, which might confuse users. Measured samples from 
commercial color charts (like RAL, Pantone and other paints and 
materials) would extend the direct useability of Radiance a lot. It 
might be an idea to plan measurements using a photospectrometer on such 
standard commercial color charts, and discuss the conversion of the 
results within this group. Or has this already be done in such an 
extensive way?

While I agree that extending the material file in the radiance 
distribution would be useful for viz, I'd like to encourage those who 
did not try yet to use their digital cameras and a calibration tool such 
as macbethcal and the not too expensive chart as a measurement device. 
Today as almost everyone has the equipment for digital photography, this 
should be not too difficult. While one can certainly discuss the 
accuracy, obtaining an "inaccurate" sample of the material that is 
actually to be simulated should still be better then an accurate sample 
of a generic material.

That said, the most important feature of a new material database must be 
detailed documentation of the samples, measurement equipment, conditions.

I have here a list of 50+ RAL and xKxxx (like 2K216) colors.
I don't remember where I got those from and if I'm allowed
to share them in public. I also do not know if the Radiance
RGB values are validated or 'just' calculated.

On the subject of material conversion in general I have
to confess that my own attempts to use the equations on
easyrgb.org failed and I really don't know how it should
be done. I was only concerned about the monitor RGB
to Radiance RGB bit (for Sketchup exports) but even here
I felt that a simple linear scale by 0.85 gave better results
than jumping from colour space to colour space. I finally
found a mail from Greg or Axel stating that these two RGB
spaces are so close that a big convoluted conversion is
often not necessary. And so I left it at that.

The library idea sounds appealing at first but i think the
practical value of validated colour charts is just as big as
a good conversion from the published RGB values. The
real world problem I see is that the colour changes it's
properties depending on the material it's painted on.
Take wall paint on plaster for example and compare this
with the same paint on a dense wood fibre board (HDF
or whatever you call it). The texture of the material will
change the properties of the paint.

So instead of a big honking official library a nice and
small peer-reviewed  HOWTO on the conversion from
manufacturer's RGB data (and colour space) to
Radiance values would have more practical value.
I assume that there is such a conversion procedure.
If we have to measure before we get any realistic
values then a library seems to be the thing to do.
Nice job for a student in the need of a thesis ...


Yours humbly,

Thomas

Hi

This RAL and xKxxx paints colors list is probably the same as the list appearing in the annex of my Radiance tutorial http://home.hefr.ch/compag/ref/RADIANCE_tutorial_E.pdf
where their reflected Yxy values (measured under the standard illuminant D65) are given.

These values were measured in years ~1991-1993 with a colorimeter at LESO-PB EPFL Lausanne (where I was working at that time) on paper paints samples. The xKxxx or xExxx color names are coming from a Swiss standard notation defined by the paints manufacturers association VSLF http://www.vslf.ch/
This tiny database was built for the ADELINE package http://www.ibp.fhg.de/wt/adeline/index.html

Turns out these are the materials from the materials.rad in
the standard distribution. So everybody has them already
and they seem not to be that interesting ...

Hi Thomas,

It would be very interesting if this list was complete.  As far as I 
know 210 ral colors are in use for architectural applications.

They are not linked. My impression is that some .cal files might be
from the old ConRad. I'm sending you Takayuki Otomo's e-mail address

Jan Diepens of University of Technologie Eindhoven sent me a complete
list of RAL colours some time ago. I have to admit that they are still
not in the ColourPicker. I've put them up for your perusal:

If anybody is going to translate the names to English, please bounce
the changes back to me for inclusion in the ColourPicker. The values
were measured with a Minolta chroma meter from samples. YXZ was then
converted to Radiance RGB with a Radiance .cal file, so the values
should be accurate.

Iebele,

I'm about as far removed from being a color expert as one can get. I
got the method from a thread in the forums for AGi32, and the method
has worked reasonably well for me (some tweaking required). I'm not
sure if the method is just a hack, but Ian Ashdown was the person who
suggested it, as well as some further reading on color science. Here's
the link, free registration required:
http://www.agi32.com/forums/view_topic.php?id=585&forum_id=4

Also, Konica-Minolta makes a luminance meter, CS-100A, that will give
you the XYZE values of what it's looking at, but I'm sure it costs a
small fortune. I think it's the one that Axel had just mentioned.

Hi guys,

I am not an expert with the radiance and i do not know if i am
repeating any simple stuff here.

Colour is a function of both the reflectivity and incident light.

Reflectivity itself is an intrinsic function and in this case i think
we are assuming lambertain( equal reflectance in all direction)
materials.

The amount of light that is reflected off a surface would be dependent
on the spectral shape of the incident light and the reflectance.

So in order to talk about the color properties of different object we
need to measure its reflectance ( use of a spectrophotometer).

Perhaps we can also include the type of incident light sources (
tungsten / sunlight) if we want to talk about reflectivity

Cheers
cw

Message-ID: <100441490811070928web4563bs198d9343e81e4b60@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I was thinking to myself and talking to my boss about this material
database. You will know that the ColourPicker on LUXAL.eu has
somewhere between 20,000 and 30,000 entries, the majority of which are
screen scraped from various web sites. Since I have now idea how the
RGB values for those colours were determined (measured, guessed, gamma
etc), they can't really be relied upon.

This leaves us with Jan's RAL materials (I'll put them up soon), and
the Building Materials which are taken from Adeline and are hopefully
correctish, although I have no idea just how good they are. Moreover,
I am potentially infringing on somebody's copyright by putting them up
on a web site. Need to check this. Who owns the Adeline intellectual
property now? Does somebody have a contact into Fraunhofer Bauphysik?

Anyhow. We in LEARN have one of these:
http://www.atecorp.com/Equipment/Minolta/CR300.asp
I also made up an RS232 cable, have some LabView code, and know the
serial protocol. So here is an offer to those of you who are based in
or around London:

You may borrow the meter for one week free of charge, provided that:

a) Your company will assure us in writing that if anything should
happen to the instrument, we will receive a replacement. No pay-off.
An actual instrument.
b) You will share all your measurements with the Radiance community.
c) I have a small collection of about 3000-4000 colour samples from
various paint manufacturers here (the ones you find at your local
builder's merchant). You agree to input some of them too, so they can
be added to the database. Once the software is cobbled together, which
should not be too hard, the actual measurement takes about one second
for each sample. What is somewhat more time consuming is the input of
colour names, codes, swatch numbers etc, although this could
potentially be semi-automated with some scanning/OCR scripts.

You are also welcome to come and visit us in Holloway Road and do some
colour measurements there. We'll find a desk for you.

If you think you can contribute with writing the software, scanning,
OCR or anything else, please do get in touch. It's a rather laborious
exercise...

Oh, one last thing: We won't be able lend the instrument before
January because of the scheduling of the academic year and the student
projects.

Cheers

Axel

Hi,

> b) You will share all your measurements with the Radiance community.

If you'd add something like 'under the same license as Radiance is
published' or 'and publish them under the MIT or BSD license', then the
results could be published and distributed together with radiance and
could be used for whatever people need to use them. Only 'sharing' does
not mean you're allowed to use them in (commercial) projects later.

Cheers,

Bernd

Message-ID: <556218.67507.qm@web28104.mail.ukl.yahoo.com>

Dear All,
?
I am doing Radiance simulations?in atrium well with higher surface reflectances ( 0.6 ~ 0.8 ~ 1, diffuse surface). 
But according to?? "Aizlewood M, Butt J, Isaac K & Littlefair P. Daylight in atria: a comparison of measurement, theory and simulation: ?Proceedings Lux Europa. Amsterdam, 1997."?? and??? "Littlefair P. Daylight prediction in atrium buildings. Solar Energy, 2002; 73: 105-109.",??? Radiance underestimated the reflected light (Internal reflected component) in atria with high reflectance (some measurements in the paper used a reflectance 0.85 and got the biggest discrepancy in IRC?was 4.87). My some simulations? got the similar results: simulations underestimated the measurement with reflectance 0.6 and 0.8 and? the higher of surface reflectance the bigger is the discrepancy. All the studies used overcast sky model and set a higher ambient parameter setting.
?
Could you help me explain the?divergence from high reflectance simulation using Radiance. Also, if these demonstrate Radiance simulation could bring some bigger errors to the dayligthing simulation in high reflectance environment?
?
BTW, I will appreciate it very much if you could share some experience or knowledge? and give some suggestion about higher reflectance simulations.

Hi Greg,

I just updated my Radiance version by installing the latest one available on
radsite.lbl.gov/radiance (rad3R9). I tried to run rtcontrib, but nothing
happened. Neither an error nor a result, and no processor activity. I didn't
see anything discussing this issue in the archives, so I would be grateful for
your help! Here are a couple of lines describing my attempts:

1) Does my terminal know rtcontrib...:

IN:
augsburg@lenipc24:~$ rtcontrib
OUT:
Usage: rtcontrib [-n nprocs][-V][-r][-e expr][-f source][-o ospec][-b binv] {-m
mod | -M file} [rtrace options] octree

Yes!

2) Is rtcontrib able to compute the contribution of the "mirrorfull_mat"
secundary sources in my scene...:

IN:(Pathnames are cut for clarity)
augsburg@lenipc24:~$ rtcontrib -m mirrorfull_mat -o mirror.dat field.oct <
cavcylmeshgrid.dat
OUT:
rtrace: warning - too many modifiers in trace list

OK, so let's try with less modifiers...

3) Is rtcontrib able to compute the contribution of the "solar" source in my
scene...:

IN:
augsburg@lenipc24:~$ rtcontrib -m solar -o solar.dat field.oct <
cavcylmeshgrid.dat
OUT:
Nothing! No error, no results (no outfile) & no processor activity.

I hope this comes from a stupid error of mine...

Hi,

for converting spectral or XYZ data to RGB see Appendix in:
Ruppertsberg, A, and Bloj, M (2006) Rendering complex scenes for psychophysics
using RADIANCE: How accurate can you get?, J. Opt. Soc. Am. A, 23, 759-768

download pdf at:
http://www.brad.ac.uk/acad/lifesci/optometry/uploads/Publications/2006xJOPTSOCAMAx23x4x759.pdf

In that paper we also used spectral data from a data base (ref 47) of Munsell
chips and natural materials:
47. See http://spectral.joensuu.fi/databases/index.html.

What I suspect you are after are surface reflectance descriptor RGB values. The
XYZ values provided by eg the macbeth color checker are colour signal data (ie
the product of surface reflectance with illumination). The illumination is most
probably D65, which is white, so it's not far off to correspond to the surface
reflectance. But a lot of people forget the distinction between colour signal
and surface reflectance.
Also remember that there are no generically valid RGB values. RGB values are
always only valid for a particular display device. In that paper up there we
have used the transformation matrix based on RADIANCE's 'built-in' primaries.
It is true that you can obtain RGB values beyond the [0 1] range when you
convert XYZ to RGB and that simply tells you that the gamut of your RGB-space
does not include that colour. Then, you have to do something, either clip it or
tone-map it....

happy colouring!

Hi Axel,

Thank you so much for posting this file. I think both your RAL file as 
the Kodak grayscale chart measurements I send in my earlier mail are 
very usefull for Radiance.

In my previous mail I mistakenly wrote that we used a Kodak 
photospectrometer for the grayscale chart from Kodak's Q-14 color 
separation guide. That chart was also measured with a Minolta device, I 
don't remember exactly wich model it was -  but it was a pretty advanced 
one that we hired for two weeks, so the file wich the greyscale 
measurements should be accurate also (which are YXZ values converted to 
Radiance RGB with a Radiance .cal file).

A list of all RAL colors in English (and other languages) can be found at:
http://www.ral.de/en/ral_farben/anwender/farbnamen_classic.php
I will be happy to translate it and send it back.

Maybe we can discuss a little bit more about the issue if such accurate 
measurements could be part of the Radiance distribution? I like to hear 
more about the pros and conts. My idea is that it would help users a lot.

-Iebele

Radiance uses slightly different color primaries and a different  
(neutral) white point than the CCIR709 set that is the basis for sRGB  
(and other RGB) standards.  This is historical, but not without  
reason, which is why you should stick with the xyz_rgb.cal file for  
back-and-forth conversions.

The higher the surface reflectances, the more bounces you need to  
compute.  In pathological cases where you have all white surfaces  
facing each other in a closed environment, you may need to disable  
the ambient cache (-aa 0) and rely on Russian roulette sampling (-lr  
-20 or so).  To get a large -ab setting to work (-ab 20 or whatever),  
you will also need to decrease the -ad setting to make this tractable  
(-ad 64 or so with -as 0).

Hi Germain,

The "too many modifiers" probably means that the mirrorfull_mat is  
being reused many times in your file.  You should define the material  
once somewhere and reuse it in our your included scene files.

As for the nothing output, this is of course suspicious, but without  
seeing your input files, quite impossible to diagnose.  Perhaps you  
could send those my way in an off-list e-mail and I'll take a look.

Best,
-Greg

It's already translated and integrated in the development version of
the Colour Picker. The link is in the main body of:
http://www.luxal.eu/resources/radiance/index.shtml

Hi Axel,

The updates to the Colour Picker are great! I see that you updated the 
conversion of XYZ to Radiance rgb. This is a big help. I also like the 
addition of the instant reflectance value when using the sliders.

Thanks for all the work on this and all the other tools and information 
on the site.

Best,

-Jack

Just to let everyone else know, this issue was resolved off-list.   
Germain was inadvertently accessing version 3.5 of rtcontrib, which  
had a bug under Linux that was fixed long ago.

Hi Greg,

on linux mkisofs should do the job, on Mac you might try disk utility. 
But - a compressed tar would be better. It also gives an one-file 
download, but I can just untar it, in the likely case that I do not want 
to burn it to a CD (I am working hard to get rid of these silly medias 
that tend to break or get lost as soon as I get them into my hands ;-) )...

Subject: [Radiance-general] objview & rvu -n
Message-ID: <4925F3EA.5030807@rumblestrip.org>

Hi Greg, et al.,

I have been playing with the new -n (#proc) switch you added to rvu.  
That is really, really nice.  I use objview all the time to preview 
scenes, set views and check geometry, and the speedup on our quad core 
machines is really great!  I thought I might be able to hack objview to 
support this new switch, but it looks like objview relies on rad to 
create the scene and defaults to x11 as the output, spawning rvu.  Is 
there a way to pass the number of processors available to the new rvu, 
via an objview command? 

I see you can also pass one of the standard rad views in lieu of the 
default XYZ; is there a way to specify a saved view, or is this a 
limitation of the way the script is all pipelined through rad?  This is 
the first time I've really looked at the objview script, and I don't 
immediately see a way to get the desired options sent to rvu.

Sure, Rob.

Just add "-N 4" to the "set opts=" line near the top of objview.  The  
rad program passes whatever is set with -N to the new rvu -n option.

As for using a saved view, the syntax:

	objview -v "-vf myview.vf" octree

should work, but it doesn't because I forgot to put quotes around the  
argument to the -v option.  On line 35 of objview, fix it to:

	set vw="$argv[1]"

Hopefully, that will work.  (I'll fix this for the next release and  
add a -N option as well.)

This worked a treat as well!  thanks Greg!  This will get confusing; for 
setting processors number you will use -N for objview and -n when 
calling rvu directly, but I'll live.  =8-)  You've made my day.

Yes, I would have used '-n' for rad as well, but that option was  
already taken.

Message-ID: <1267897917.63261227492221059.JavaMail.osg@osgjas03.cns.ufl.edu>

Hello Everyone,

I am Performing simulations for a 18'X12" office room with one 
6'X6' window facing the south side, with blinds attached on the 
interior side. I am calculation Illuminance values and Daylight 
Glare Index values (DGI) values at different reference points 
starting from close to the window to the back wall.

I am getting Illuminance values ranging from 4500 lux to 600 lux, 
but the glare Index values are coming out to be zero for all 
points. I don't know if these are normal values or not. I am 
attaching the output file along. I would like to know your 
comments,

Thank you.

Message-ID: <a38244780811250849k7b84340bmb16e37abd24984b4@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am trying to render an image using only ambient light.  I noticed that the
reflected light appears to be non-uniform across the objects in the scene.
The scene is a open box with the open part facing the viewer and only
surfaces inside the box are lit (outside of the box is dark).  It appears
that the light has some directionality to it.  I'm guessing that there is a
setting value that I have not appropriately set or something.  I wondered if
anyone had an idea what might be problem. The rpict parameters are listed as
the following:

rpict -t 12 -vf view_files/rightview.vf -x 1600 -y 1600 -ps 3 -pt .08 -dp
512 -ar 48 -ms 0.71 -ds .2 -dj .5 -dt .1 -dc .5 -dr 1 -sj .7 -st .1 -ab 1
-aa .15 -ad 800 -as 128 -av 0.5 0.5 0.5 -lr 8 -lw .002 -dj 0.6 -dt 0.01 -dr
3 -ds 0.1 -sj 0.7 -st 0.15 -dc 0.5 -lr 1 -aw 0 -av 0.02317 0.02317 0.02317

Any ideas would be appreciated.

Thank you,

Bei

When you say that you are rendering using only ambient light, do you
mean that there are no sources in your scene (no sky definition, no
surfaces with materials such as light, glow, source) and only the
contribution due to -av 0.02317? If so, your directionality might be due
to the ambient bounce, which is not uniformly distributing light because
of the one open side of the box. Try again with -ab 0 instead of -ab 1
and see if that gives what you had wanted. It seems you are only trying
to render a purely theoretical scene?

What is your light source? Even an ambient light has to begin somewhere. Maybe an overcast sky without a sun?  
Are you using rad with a rif file? If so, increase the quality...
Your -ad and -as settings are pretty small
QUALITY=h
DETAIL= h
VARIABILITY= m

The ambient light setting in Radiance is different to other renderers
- or maybe it's not if I think about it. Anyway, it's not supposed to  
replace
a proper light source in your scene (a 'light' or 'source' material for
example). It's just there to 'take over' when the proper ray tracing
does not produce a light source in an acceptable time. That means
it's only applied it the renderer has not found a light source after
tracing a ray for '-ab' bounces through the scene.

In your case with a box open to the dark void every ray that leaves
the box adds nothing to the illuminance level of a point. The closer
you are to the (front) edge the more rays escape the box and the
darker this point will be in the image.

The points at the back of the box are only 'bright' because the
renderer assigns an artificial brightness to the ray after the first
bounce (-ab 1). You can probably achieve a smoother gradient
in your image by increasing the -ab value.

If you enclose your open box and the camera with another
closed box you will probably see that there is no directionality
to the ambient light and everything will be uniformly grey (if
there is only one material). Every ray not hits a surface and
the brightness is only modified by the reflectance of the
material.

Thomas

We tried placing the scene and camera within the context of a larger box and
this seemed to solve the problem that we were having.  Thank you everyone
for all your help.

Hello,

I am completing my PhD on daylighting simulation and I need any of CIE
performed validations of the Radiance in order to satisfy bureaucratic
procedures.

Has the Radiance been tested against CIE TC 3.33 test cases?

Hello Everyone,

I am involved in the simulations of interior Venetian blinds in a 
10' wide, 18' long and 10' high
office room with one 6 ' by 6 ' window placed on the south 
oriented wall. The window sill height is 3'.

I am observing that the illuminance levels inside the room (at the 
sensor point close to the window) are higher with the interior 
Venetian blinds placed in the model (4500? lux) as compared to the 
model without the blinds (3000 ?lux).
Also even though the illuminance levels are much higher (at the 
level of 4500 lux close to the window) there is no glare index 
observed (that is value of Daylight glare index DGI is equal to 
zero).

I am attaching a compressed file folder containing all the input 
files and the octree files. I might sound very naive to you, 
please excuse me for any ignorance on my part, I am very new to 
the Radiance as well as UNIX. I have used the PICO text editor as 
vi text editor was having some problems in my system. There is a 
file named command, in the folder attached, it has all the 
commands that I have used in compiling and generating different 
components of the model. finalmultiplesim1.csh is the shell script 
used and January.out is the output file.

I would appreciate some suggestions as to where I might be going 
wrong with the simulations.

Thank you.

Hi,

I did some validations of Radiance against these CIE test scenes, but 
only for the
experimental test cases (chapter 4) and a few test cases with analytical 
references
(chapter 5, TC 5.6, 5.7, 5.8). You can find the results in my 
presentation from this
year's Radiance workshop. Unfortunately I did not use the test cases, 
which are
dealing with daylight (I guess they would be more important for you).

Kind regards,
David

Hi,

I read the PDF file of your presentation yesterday and wondered if there are any plans to merge your code changes into the main Radiance distrubution at some point. Did you discuss this with Greg already? Seems to me it would improve the accuracy especially with circular light sources quite noticably.
We too did some work on Radiance together with Arne Duer in 2003/2004 so I was happy to see there is still interest in improving Radiance at the University of Innsbruck.

I've just had a quick look at your files. At the sky condition that
you've included in the files I'd say that the sunbeam through the
window misses the sample point (therefore no direct component).
If you have the blinds down you get some reflected sunlight at
the sample point which increases the illuminance.

I have to play around with your scene a bit to confirm this but
from an initial rendering this seems to be the case.

Can't comment on the glare issue.

Thomas

I've noticed that you have boxes ('tables') in your room that are
exactly the same height as your sample points (0.75m). Please
lift your sample points (or lower the desks) by a small amount
(0.01m is enough). When a point for rtrace calculation is located
on a surface (as in your case) the results are not predictable.

Raising the points slightly above the surface will not influence
your illuminance values but it will provide reliable results.

I'd say it is quite unusual to do an illuminance calculation with
a horizontal orientation directly on a surface. Effectively you are
blocking half of the hemisphere with your table surface. I would
run all the calculations without the desks in the scene to see if
that makes a difference.

Regards,
Thomas

I'm still looking at this.  My main hesitation is that the changes,  
while improving the accuracy for disk sources at close quarters, will  
increase the number of samples by a factor of six for distant disk  
sources.  That's a trade-off I'd rather not make, so I'm thinking of  
how we might get around it.

Best,
-Greg

Hello Thanks for you prompt reply.. I tried the simulations by 
removing the desks placed.. but it does not seem to make much of a 
difference.

About the sky condition, Is there something wrong with the sky 
condition, I mean do I need to change anything in it ?

Thank you

I don't think so. I was just explaining why you might see get higher
illumination values with the blinds down.

Hello Everyone,

Thanx again Dr Bleicher, Assuming that the blinds are used to 
block the sunlight coming inside, then why is it that the blinds 
in my model are not blocking the sunlight coming in ? is there any 
problem with my model..? I would really appreciate if some one 
could help me out with this problem.

Thank you.

It's just Mr me.

Your blinds are fine but the bright material reflects a lot of the
sun light (direct, very bright) to the ceiling. I've rendered an
image of the scene here:

http://sites.google.com/site/tbleicher/radiance

The additional illumination is - I think - caused by the light
reflected from the blinds to your sensor point. Without blinds
there is just the part of the sky you can see from the sample
point (no sun for the sky condition shown). With blinds the
sunlight is reflected diffusely at the blinds and a lot of sun light
is redirected to the sensor point that has not been there before.
Because the blinds are bright white this exceeds the light of
the sky dome so you get higher illumination values.

I haven't had time yet to do a renderings without blinds to
confirm this.

This might also explain why you get negative values for your
glare index. I'm no expert but AFAIK the glare index is calculated
from local hot spots. With your blinds there are no hot spots because
the whole window is uniformly bright. You can look into this year's
workshop presentations on glare from daylight by Jan Wienold:

http://www.radiance-online.org/radiance-workshop7/

You have to contact him directly about a copy of 'evalglare'. The
link in the presentation still does not work ...

Subject: [Radiance-general] Gendaylit
Message-ID: <242207.16532.qm@web26608.mail.ukl.yahoo.com>

Dear users,

I know this question is not directly linked to using Radiance/ESP-r but more in installing and making the programmes work as standalone and in coupling. Therefore I hope this is the right forum to post such a question :)

I am using Ubuntu v. 8.10.

I have downloaded and installed Radiance and ESP-r. Both programmes seems to work but there might be missing some libaries to Ubuntu. In order to make the coupling between ESP-r and Radiance, Gendaylit needs to be installed. I have done so by changing the makefile in the Gendaylit package to:

CCOPTS= -g
#CCOPTS= -Ae -g ??? # HPUX

CC=gcc
#CC=cc

and issued the command 'make'. I have copied the file 'Gendaylit' to '/opt/radiance/bin'? and 'coeff_perez.dat', 'defangle.dat' and 'perezlum.cal' to '/opt/radiance/lib'

To test the Gendaylit file one can issue 'make skyview'. I have done so both as root and as PHA and I get the following errors:

oconv -f sky.rad outside.rad > sky.oct
/bin/sh: oconv: not found
make: *** [skyview] Error 127

or

oconv -f sky.rad outside.rad > sky.oct
/bin/sh: cannot create sky.oct: Permission denied
make: *** [skyview] Error 2

I must also say that I have added the following to both '.profile'-files in '/home/pha' and in '/root'

#Set PATH for ESP-r and Radiance
RAYPATH= .:/lib:/opt/radiance/lib:/opt/radiance/bin
PATH=$PATH:/opt/esru/bin:/opt/esru/esp-r/bin:/opt/radiance/lib:/opt/radiance/bin

export PATH RAYPATH
unset USERNAME

I suspect that there is something wrong with '/bin/sh' which is listed in Ubuntu 8.10 as symlink 'sh -> dash' and 'sh.distrib -> bash'.

I am afried to make any changes to the linux destribution because I am not that familiar with linux.

Can anybody spot a solution to my problem?

Any help is appresiated. 



Best regards

Per Haugaard

You can just run gendaylit from the command line to
test if it's working. See the man page or the make file
you are using for some invocations. That does not tell
you whether the output is garbage, though. Perhaps
the makefile tests that, too?

Anyway, your error points to a problem with the environment:
the makefile can not find oconv in your path. Can you
run the command 'oconv' from the command line in the
same directory where the makefile is?

Now that means you are not allowed to create a file
in the directory where you are. Do you have write permissions
in this directory? If you are in the '/opt' branch you will
have to use sudo to run these commands. It's better to
copy the test files into your home directory and run
the tests there.

'dash' is just another POSIX shell. There should only be
a problem if one of the scripts uses 'bash' syntax and does
not ask for bash explicitly in the first line. I don't know much
about it (especially the startup procedure) so I can't tell if
your $PATH settings are actually read in when you start
a terminal window.

To test your settings just type 'env' and search for
the PATH and RAYPATH settings. If they are incomplete
or not there at all your .profile is not read when you start
a terminal session. There are some ways to solve this
but I'd need to know more about your system for that.
So see first if that is (part of) your problem.

You can always install other shells next to the system
shell. In particular 'csh' (or 'tcsh') is required by some
Radiance scripts but not installed by default. Just adding
another one does not damage your system.
The system scripts on Ubuntu should run on 'bash' just as
well btw, only somewhat slower.

Thomas
