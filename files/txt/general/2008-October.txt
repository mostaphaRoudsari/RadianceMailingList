Subject: [Radiance-general] Glass Transmittance not showing 
Message-ID: <001701c9282a$6b836340$428a29c0$@com>

Hi!

I am new to Desktop Radiance and wish to ask if anybody knows why I could
not get any differences in luminance rendering clear and dark glass.  I have
2 types of glass, one is clear with below transmittance:

void glass Clear
0
0
3 	0.890 0.961 0.961


Another glass is darker with below transmittance:

void glass Project_SC_0_2
0
0
3 	0.308 0.308 0.308

We wish to know how dark would the rooms be with a glass shading coefficient
of 0.20 and visible light transmittance of 0.28.  The above radiance
transmission numbers were generated by Ecotect.  I tried editing them to:

void glass Project_SC_0_2
0
0
3 	0.28 0.28 0.28

But I get the same image rendered, the objects behind the glass looks the
same.  Looks like there is no difference in the transmission thru the glass,
or is there something wrong with my approach?  But when I click on the image
to display luminance I get different cd/m2 numbers.

Any advise would be helpful.  Thanks in advance!

I think you only have a problem in understanding the image format and  
its
representation on screen.

Radiance stores the calculation result as an image where every pixel has
RGB value and an exponent giving the 'brightness' of the point. This
format can store an illuminance range that exceeds the capabilities  
of your
display by far. To get a visual impression (the image you would expect
from the rendering) the image viewer has to convert the real values  
in the
picture file to RGB values for your computer screen.

If you have two different pictures with the same scene but lit with  
different
amounts of light this adjustment will present you the image optimised  
for
the display, which probably means that the real brightness of the scene
is changed to something that gives the best representation for your  
eyes.
The images 'look' similar (or indeed identical) but the real content  
of the
image is different (as you have found out with the cd/m2 values).

You can think of this process of something like your eyes do in  
different
lighting conditions: At first you will feel blinded in a bright room  
but after
a while your eyes adjust to the light levels and you can see  
normally. If
you move to an identical but dimly lit room you will think it's too  
dark. After
some time you will get used to it and you can see in this room just  
like in
the room before.


To help you with your problem:

While you view the image in an image viewer for Radiance *.pic file
format you have to set the 'exposure' to the same value for both images.
If you use ximage (on Unix) use the '-e' option for this.

If you can't do this in your picture viewer use the tool 'pcompos' to  
combine
the two pictures into one and view them at the same time:

pcompos -a 2 bright.pic dark.pic > brigh_and_dark.pic

Subject: [Radiance-general] obj2rad failing
Message-ID: <00038B6E.48EBFC75@192.168.0.81>

Hi all,

I am currently testing differrent converters with what you could call 'real-world' scene files originating from differrent CAD systems and modellers. While exploring the capabilities of obj2rad I noticed that it fails on a OBJ File (exported from ArchiCAD) with the following error:

example.obj: Wavefront syntax error near line 167037: Bad face

Here is the 'bad' part of the file (line 167037 - 167041)

f  29760/83929/29760 29761/83930/29761 29762/83931/29762 29763/83932/29763
vt 42.5353 8.46865
vt 42.5353 8.474
vt 42.53 8.474
vt 42.53 8.469

Other parts of the obj file work fine:

f  29682/83789 29683/83790 29684/83791 29685/83792
vt -0.019984 -0.400179
vt 8.56333 -0.400179
vt 8.58332 0
vt 0 0

The OBJ file format specification tells me that both 'f' lines are perfectly legal:

Using v, vt, and vn to represent geometric vertices, texture vertices,
and vertex normals, the statement would read:

    f v/vt/vn v/vt/vn v/vt/vn v/vt/vn

But obj2rad doesn't seem to like the 3rd number(s) vn which are supposed to represent the vertex normals. The obj2rad man page doesn't go into much detail about the 'f' statement with respect to allowed format. Running obj2rad -f (ignoring vertex normal information) also fails on the exact same line. 

I will try to get ahold of some smaller ArchiCAD OBJ exports now and see if I can narrow down the problem. If anyone has some ideas or similar experiences I would sure appreciate to hear from you!
TIA,
 Erwin

Hi Erwin,

The problem with that face is that it refers to vertex normals 29760,  
29761, and 29763, whereas you've only defined 544 normals up until  
that point in the file.  It is illegal to refer to an undefined index  
in obj2rad, hence the reported error.  None of the other OBJ file  
converters will like it, either.  The faces up until that point in  
the file don't use vertex normals, so they pass without complaint.

-Greg

P.S.  To those of you confused by this exchange, Erwin sent me his  
OBJ file in a separate e-mail at my request.

Hi Greg,

thanks for the investigation. This means that Archicad produces faulty OBJ files or something went wrong during the export. I will have to ask the folks who gave me the file. I tried importing this file into other modellers, some of them seem to ignore all faulty objects, and some of them import everything only up to that line. But I have not checked this out in great detail. Maybe I can implement some kind of syntax checker that does some sanity checks on obj files before I throw them at obj2rad. I guess my goal will be to import at least the geometry, even if the vn or vt info is not correct. 
Regards,
 Erwin

Hi Erwin,

Importing minus the vertex and textures can be done with this command:

	sed '/^f /s@/[0-9/]*@@g' Hauk-EZ.obj | obj2rad > Hauk-EZ.rad

Seems to work for me, at least.

-Greg

P.S.  I also tried putting all the vertex normals at the front of the  
file, thinking maybe ACAD just scattered them throughout in violation  
of one of the Wavefront syntax restrictions, but there were still  
faces that referred to vertex normal indices that exceeded the total  
number of vertex normals in the file.

Hi All,
 
I've got a model from an architect, built in Rhino, that I need to get
into Radiance. Typically we do this via Ecotect, exporting 3ds files
from Rhino, importing into Ecotect, and using Ecotect to generate my rad
files. However, this model is just a mess once it's imported into
Ecotect - even the flat facades are a mess of triangles, and the reduce
coincident triangles/polygons command is all but worthless. The Rhino
model is actually fairly complex, it's a masterplan with 20 or so
towers, but even doing just one building is going to take me a day to
clean up. Does anyone have any suggestions?
 
Thanks,
Cramer

Hi Cramer,
 
try obj2rad. Therefore you simply have to export parts of the model as
Wavefront(*.obj) in rhino. 
Then you can convert them with:  obj2rad  *.obj > *.rad. 
 
Afterwards it's pretty simple and fast to import these *.rad files into
ecotec again.
 
Kind regards,
Kai

When you export 3d geometry from rino you have a choice of the file type
(3d studio, dxf etc) and you also have the choice (a slider bar) of how
much detail to export for complex surfaces. If the stuff that's in your
masterplan is rectilinear (i.e. not a bunch of NURBS objects) then this
slider should be almost all the way to the left (for less detail). That
might be where all those triangles are coming from, as rino is designed to
model complex shapes like sailboat hulls, it has to reduce its curvy
objects to faceted objects (so other programs can read them) and if it
adds too many triangles then the file will be unnessicarily large for what
you want to do.

is it a DXF file?  It probably should be. (just a guess : )  )

Also, how large is the file size? Maybe you can ask for your architect to
supply you with several exports, low, med and high file size exports of
the same geometry.

It's been a few years since I have used rino extensively so i hope this
helps.

Hi Cramer,

Other solution:
export file from rhino to dxf, then you can convert them with:  dxf2rad
 *.dxf > *.rad


Kind regards,
Giorgio Butturini

Cramer,

I've come across the same thing in the past and thought that it was due to the model being a set of NURBS surfaces that rhino is segmenting to turn into a DXF. I think there is a way to try and get rhino to clean some of this up but haven't found a fast process to do so.

Do you need to clean up the model? I would try a test render to find out what kind of processing time it takes to render and use this to evaluate if you need to clean up. In ecotect the edges are highlighted to help you indentify different objects. I've found in the past that these often don't show up in a radiance render and this can often be less time consuming than trying to process the surfaces.

Hi All,
 
I've got a model from an architect, built in Rhino, that I need to get
into Radiance. Typically we do this via Ecotect, exporting 3ds files
from Rhino, importing into Ecotect, and using Ecotect to generate my rad
files. However, this model is just a mess once it's imported into
Ecotect - even the flat facades are a mess of triangles, and the reduce
coincident triangles/polygons command is all but worthless. The Rhino
model is actually fairly complex, it's a masterplan with 20 or so
towers, but even doing just one building is going to take me a day to
clean up. Does anyone have any suggestions?
 
Thanks,
Cramer

Yep, often Rhino produces horrible large meshes for solid / brep  
objects.
If you simple select all objects in your scene and run the "explode"  
command, then if you mesh your objects the meshes are really just fine.
Best thing is to make layers of material, than mesh per material layer.

Writing a rhino -> radiance mesh converter with RhinoScript is pretty  
trivial too, if you need to do this ask more often or are interested  
in developing a workflow.

Cheers,

Hi all

I'm trying to install Radzilla onto my Mac.  I am at the beginning of my understanding of all things Unix based and installing Radiance was a steep hill.  Can anyone give me an idiots guide on what I need to do to install Radzilla?  So far I have installed QT4 okay and I have Xcode tools installed.  However the Radzilla install completes with a number of errors...

Any pointers will be greatly appreciated.

Hi Dan,

there is a dedicated Radzilla mailing list. Would binaries be helpful 
for you? I had problems with the GUI (which was built but not really 
useable on a Mac), but have been successful installing the command-line.

HI

I am running simulations of Blinds in a small office room. I am 
trying to get glare values for my viewpoints. While running the 
findglare program I get the following segmentation fault

findglare -vf bestview.vp -ga 10-60:10 -av .1 .1 .1 sample1.oct

Segmentation fault

Any Advice would be helpful.. Thanx in advance..

Can you please give details on the operating system, system
architecture, and the release and source of the findglare you used? That
will make it easier to track problems.

Hello Dr Grobe,

Thanx for the prompt reply. I am Using Mac OSX. I have installed 
Radiance version 3.9.
I am not from a Computer Science background so excuse me for lack 
of knowledge about this but I did not exactly get what you meant 
by release and source of findglare..!!

Thank you again.

yep, same on macosx/intel here...
the solution?use the PPC intel binaries...
I guess there is a bug somewhere and the intel processors do not like  
it.
funnily enough the old PPCs are ok :-)

Must be a pointer or byte-order issue.  I'll have to look into it  
when I get back from Japan next week.  Luckily, I have a MacBook I  
can experiment with at home.

Hi again...

I have Installed RADIANCE 3.9 Official Release 30 April 2008 by GW 
from the following link : 
http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/framed.html

Let me know if this is reliable or i must use binaries from other 
links..?

Thank you again...

Dear list,

A beta version of the new LEARNIX live-CD is up for grabs:
http://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/learnix/

LEARNIX is now based on Ubuntu, rather than Knoppix. We use Bernd's
official Radiance packages. Please get it, test it, and send any
feedback off-list directly to me. Note that some of the documentation
has not been updated, e.g. the Getting Started Guide and Luisa's ESP-r
tutorial.

Although some seemingly unmaintained or non-functional packages have
been dropped, we are happy to announce that Andreas' radview, as well
as Ilya's mt tools have made it into LEARNIX.

There are a number of test scripts under /usr/local/share/learnix
which are designed to verify the functionality of Radiance and
add-ons. We would greatly appreciate if you could give any feedback
and/or suggestions on them, too.

Cheers

Axel

great to know the packages are useful here, too. What I'm wondering
about is if there's anything else out there which is under a DFSG
compatible license and could be included in Debian, too? If somebody
else would like to maintain such packages in Debian just let me know and
I'll happily review and sponsor the uploads for them - or create and
maintain the packages if you want me to.


Cheers,

Bernd

Hi,

I suppose you can use some of standard Radiance tools for that, but here is
another way we use.

In Raddisplay http://deluminaelab.com/en/raddisplay_details.html program you
can create falsecolor image from your original radiance image. If you define
false color palette with 2 colors - one has value 0 and another value you
want to use as a threshold, and open Statistiques dialog, you'll have
percent for each color in the tablle. You can also define the palette with
more colors, for various threshold values.

Hope this helps,
Marija
De Luminae.

And here is one of the many possible standard Radiance tools ways:

pvalue -h -H -o -b -df input.pic | rcalc -if -of -e '$1=1;$2=if(179* 
$1-THRESHOLD,1,0)' | total -if2

You need to set THRESHOLD to the desired luminance value (in cd/ 
m^2).  This will give you two numbers, the ratio of which is the  
percentage you seek.  If you want to do it all on the command line,  
you can add:

	| rcalc -e '$1=100*$2/$1'

to the end of the pipe.

Interesting approach. I would have used physical mock ups to decide on
materials (diffusers, layout and spacing) and measurements on a number
of lamps of the same type to check for manufacturing inconsistencies.

With Radiance you introduce the new complexity of modelling the
physical materials _correctly_ in a virtual world and in some cases
you have to deal with the optimisation of the algorithms.

At a first look I'd say your spotty images are the result of "-av 0 0  
0"  and a rather low
"-ab 4". Note that the trans material will swallow one bounce just to  
let light pass. That
leaves you 3 bounces to hit a light source which is not a lot.

As a first step I'd set "-av" to something realistic. You should be  
able to calculate a
reasonably good approximation of the ambient value from your physical  
set up.

Next: Your rendering times might benefit from an 'illum' calculation.  
Replace the
"trans" material ceiling with an "illum" to make it a direct light  
source. This will affect
the appearance of the ceiling but not the accuracy of the rendering.  
However, this
may go against your idea of simulating the physical set up.

In your last image you're disabling the ambient cache with "-aa 0".  
Now every
ray is calculated with your high settings. You can probably reduce "- 
ad" and "-as"
a lot in your uniform environment. I'd also set "-lr" back to 8  
again. There is a
difference but it has not such a big visual impact.

Thomas

Subject: [Radiance-general] Scaling texture
Message-ID: <337A1B23-3E92-4BB6-AFCA-C498EA599C6A@umn.edu>

Hello,

I am rendering a movie of an cube that  gradually changes its height.

Since, as far as I know I can only scale meshes uniformly in Radiance  
(-s),  I am constructing my meshes in matlab, export them as .obj,  
convert them to .rtm and render each frame with Radiance. This part  
works fine.

I also want to texture-map my cube,  and the texture should scale  
together with the geometry. I tried this several ways using brightfunc  
(with a modified version of  Mark Stock's checker.cal) and colorpict,  
however all my animations look similar to this:

http://www.bilkent.edu.tr/~katja/cube.html

Instead of what you see I would like the texture to "squeeze" (i.e.  
stripes getting thinner in z-direction) as the object shrinks in height.

If any one could point me to information that helps me solving this  
problem, that would be most appreciated.


Thank you very much.

Kind Regards,

Katja Doerschner

Since you're already using the 'obj' format for the first export I'd add
UV texture coordinates to the 'obj' and convert to mesh with obj2mesh.
If you keep the UV coordinates the same for different sizes of the cube
you will get the same mapping effect.

Using the basic Radiance texture mapping I think you will have to
scale the texture along the z-axis to get the effect you want. That
requires a new material definition for each frame you export.

Thomas

Hi Ljubica,

I just want to add to what Thomas wrote.  Quoting your webpage:

> Materials are basic :
> walls are mirrors (80% reflexion - mirror material)
> ceiling is translucent (60% transmission all diffuse, trans material)
> floor is gray (60% reflexion, plastic material)
> half-sphere is blue plastic

Since your trans surface blocks visibility of the light sources, I  
wouldn't recommend using the mirror type for this at all.  I'd just  
use an 80% reflective metal material (pure specular) and let the  
interreflection calculation handle it.  I don't think an illum is  
suitable, due to the high variance in luminance over the surface of  
each panel.

I'm actually quite surprised at how bad these results look.  I think  
something else must be going on that I don't understand, like leaks  
at the sides of the structure.  Anyway, try it without the mirror  
type and see if that helps.

Your calculation time could probably be improved without too much  
loss in accuracy by using a glow material for the cylindrical light  
sources -- set the distance limit to something like 4 times the size  
of one of your light panel widths.

Finally, I don't think a pure diffuse translucent material can have a  
transmission over 50%.

Best,
-Greg

It's a new set of scripts, though I started with Schorsch's scripts,  
as well as the Radiance makefiles. This new set of scripts has ended  
up very different because I had different goals. The scripts use more- 
current SCons features. They are cross-platform, though the set of  
platforms is limited. The libraries built follow the makefile model as  
closely as I could quickly manage (few large libraries) rather than  
the Schorsch model (many small libraries). I like to think that this  
makes for simpler build scripts. I do, though, incorporate much of

Probably the biggest practical difference is that I have not written

OK, thanks for the additional explanation.  I'm moving this thread to  
the development list for those who want to continue with it.  It's  
really out of my domain.

Use the attached version of findglare, instead.  It's recompiled from  
3.9 sources.

Message-ID: <100441490810250720n6c6ddf64iceb54c768a459b16@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Greg,

I'm just updating my tutorial, and decided to be be more consistent
with directories and file extensions. I personally still use trad a
lot--it's convenient, fast, and doesn't get in the way.

trad still puts the old .pic extension on image files. The general
consensus nowadays seems to be to use .hdr. Since it's a quick
find-and-replace jobbie, may I propose to use this convention for rad
and trad as well. I'd be happy to send you patch.

Regards

Axel

I rather like (and have become accustomed to, and have built scripts  
around) the .pic extension referring to a raw Radiance-generated  
image.  I dunno how everyone else feels, but with all the available  
sources for hdr images, some of which we can call "hdr" images, I'd  
rather keep our good old .pic extension as a Radiance community  
standard.

All suffixes in Radiance are just a convention, but since both  
Windows and Mac OS X look at the suffix as a first indication of file  
type, it's not a bad idea to standardize them.  The "hdr" suffix has  
definitely been picked up by the mainstream as a Radiance image file,  
while the "pic" suffix gets confused for other types on the different  
systems.  In this respect, I agree with Axel that it would be  
beneficial to change this convention, if people are OK with that.

Although I can see Rob's point that it's nice to have a suffix that  
uniquely identifies a Radiance-generated image from other possible  
sources, the de facto use of extensions does not support this these  
days.  An extension indicates the file type, not its creator.

If anyone else has a good reason why we should not switch to using  
".hdr" in place of ".pic" in rad/trad/etc. in the next release, now  
is the time to speak up.

I agree. There are too many apps which already use "pic", and it's  
confusing besides; there's more information in an HDR map than there  
is in a conventional image file. Perhaps we could also register a MIME  
type for hdr files? Or has that already been done? I'm willing to  
undertake the work on that, if people want and if it hasn't been done  
yet.

Brilliant!

I've looked into this, but are are not sufficiently confident with HDR
file format.

Let's move this thread over to dev and continue there.

Ogg: [Radiance-general] rayinit.cal problems

Hello all,

I recently
installed radiance on my Ubuntu machine and am now having
some
problems with rpict. I get the error: rpict: fatal - cannot find
function file "rayinit.cal." I searched through the mailing list
archives and found a few items on the placement of library files and
setting path variables, but nothing I've done has worked. Currently I
have my library files in /usr/local/lib/ray, and I checked to make
sure
that rayinit.cal is indeed in there (it is). The path variables
are
exporting properly as I can see the paths when I "echo $PATH" and
"echo
$RAYPATH," however rpict is still not finding rayinit.cal for
some
reason. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Dave

It's probably a RAYPATH problem. Look for rayinit.cal, and set the  
RAYPATH environment variable to ".:(path)"

Hi Tom,

It's been a while since your original post, I'm behind on reading the
radiance general emails.

A while back I was able to download the linux source code and compile it on
Mac OSX with some minor changes to the makefile.  I don't remember what
modifications were, but I think if you try to compile daysim and look at the
errors the necessary modifications can be deciphered.

I used Daysim version 2.2P2 (Linux) to do this.

Andy

Message-ID: <127681.31787.qm@web56906.mail.re3.yahoo.com>

?Hello everyone, 

I need to calculate solar altitude for 2008, from 6.15 to 18:00 every 15 minute step, and use this information to calculate the direct normal irradiance and together with diffuse irradiance? (I have direct and diffuse irradiance values) as an input for? PEREZ model using RADIANCE.

?I wanted to ask if RADIANCE can provide me with this information, so a list of sun altitude for a year-based. 

I have seen some website where I can calculate the sun altitude for a single step, however I need the data for a year-based, and it is not a good idea to calculate it each time step.? 

?If not, can someone provide me with some sources? (formulas) how to calculate the values?

I thank you in advance, 

Best Regards, 

Sokol Dervishi,

Hello

Azimuth and altitude angles are both given as comments in the output of the gensky program.
Here are two very simple C-shell scripts that will just extract these values. You may use them to build a script to generate the data you need.

Hope this will help you.

Thank you so much Dr Ward, This works..

I would like to know If it is possible to find Glare Index Values 
at specific point coordinates, like the way we calculate 
Illuminance values...?

Thanks again..

Hi -- glad it works.  Yes, you may calculate glare index values at  
specific points, corresponding to eye positions.  The "glare" script  
should help you with that.

Best,
