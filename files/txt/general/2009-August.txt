Hello again,

I had been running recently the file from Greg, and the whole process
completed succesfully, after the latest update of Ubuntu i can not run
"make". The answer i get is the following:

wales@wales-laptop:~/pool$ make
oconv -f pool_surface.rad catchpool.rad > catchscene.oct
vwrays -vf pool_par.vf -x 500 -y 500 -ff \
        | rtcontrib -w -ffc -c -n 2 \
            -f pool_coords.cal -o %s_caustics.pic \
            -b floor_bin -bn 7500 -x 50 -y 150 -m floor \
            -b s_wall_bin -bn 1500 -x 50 -y 30 -m s_wall \

            -b w_wall_bin -bn 4500 -x 150 -y 30 -m w_wall \
            catchscene.oct
rtrace: fatal - command line error at '2'
rtcontrib: fatal - rtrace process died
make: *** [floor_caustics.pic] Error 1

Any suggestion is accepted since i am completely new and lost.

Thank you in advance

Remove the "-n 2" option from the command line or move it right behind
the "rtcontrib" command. I think at the current position it's treated as an
option for rtrace which does not have a "-n" option.

You mentioned an upgrade to Ubuntu, anything you can think of this would affect? Some impact of text format of the make file? File permissions of the directory and files within?

You have a different error this time which either means you?ve either made
progress and have a new problem or you have more clues to diagnose your
original problem.

Previously the you had:
?... | rtcontrib -w -ffc -c -n 2 \
??? ??? ??? -f pool_coords.cal -o %s_caustics.pic \ ...
And the error was:   rtrace: fatal - command line error at '2'

So you deleted ?n 2
...| rtcontrib -w -ffc -c \
??? ??? ??? -f pool_coords.cal -o %s_caustics.pic \ ...

And got the error:  rtrace: fatal - command line error at 'pool_coords.cal'

In both cases the error occurs after the ?c option.  I think radiance
expects ?c to be followed by an argument, which it is taking to be ?n in the
first case and ?f in the second case.  The following argument (2 or
pool_coords.cal) is then interpreted as an option that doesn?t exist.

Try putting a ?1? after ?c :
...| rtcontrib -w -ffc -c 1 \
??? ??? ??? -f pool_coords.cal -o %s_caustics.pic \ ...

And see what you get.

Reading through the man pages for rtcontrib and rtrace I would think
that "-w" and "-ffc" are both rtrace options. You can remove them
to see if the command runs through then. The output would not be
useable, but it might help to find the problem. In particular "-w" turns
off warnings from rtrace.

I could not find the "-c" option in the (online) man pages. Perhaps
that's a source for an error there, too.

The -c is the number of rays to collect. The default value is 1, however 
to use the default value I would expect that you do not specify -c or 
else you do -c 1 as per Andrew's direction. Note you can run "rtcontrib 
-defaults" to see what the default settings are for rtcontrib.

Looking back through this thread Greg told you to use -c to replace '!total
-if22500.

Maybe it should be -c 22500 ?  I can't tell for sure though without looking
at poolcoords.cal.

You guys are close, but the correct setting is "-c 0" to get full

Hello again,

 

After adding "0" value after -c , everything is working perfectly. Thanks to
everyone about suggestions. I hope that one day I can return the favour.
Imagine how many problems I will have on my model if I have so many problems
in the example file.

 

Thanks again everyone

Hi!

> We finished a new version of RadDisplay tool.

I think it would be great to have that in Debian, so I've started a packaging
effort at svn.debian.org/svn/python-apps/packages/raddisplay/trunk (access via
svn:// or - if you have an account on alioth.debian.org - via ssh+svn://....).
Unfortunately I don't have much spare time, to I would appreciate if somebody
would like to maintain it - with a lot of help from me of course. That's also a
good start into Debian packaging practice :)

Cheers,

Bernd

Subject: [Radiance-general] Using SSLD skies with sun
Message-ID: <4A82798E.7030908@gmx.net>

Hi,

I know that not many here use the SSLD skies, but maybe one or another 
has a comment on it...

I am currently using gensky to find the brightness levels and sun 
position required to use the SSLD skies. Now I am wondering whether this 
combination hides some risks.

First, when I add a gensky-sun to the ssld-sky, in my understanding this 
should not change the horizontal illuminance but be kind of a technical 
optimization, replacing the bright glow spot where the sun is seen by a 
source of type light, thus making sure that shadow-test actually hit it. 
This would require the flux of the sky (glow) part to be covered to be 
the same as the flux of the sun light source.

Second, gensky manipulates the sun position when coming close to the 
zenith and sets it to 87.5 altitude. I am in a tropical country, where 
this 90 degrees can be reached. In such a case, I would have two suns in 
my sky definition - the one in the ssld glow source (at 90 degree) PLUS 
the gensky light source at 87.5 degree, right?

I am just trying to debug my sky setups, so any comments are appreciated :-D

Cheers Lars.

Hi Lars,

The SSLD sky generator creates a diffuse sky distribution.  If you don't put a sun in there, there won't be one.  If you're sky model involves a diffuse sky that is brightest in the sun direction, but the sun itself is not directly visible, then you'll just need to ensure you get the diffuse horizontal illuminance you're looking for (and that's the hard part - what should the diffuse horizontal illuminance be?).

So you won't end up with two sun definitions.  And you control the diffuse and direct components of global horizontal illuminance.  If the sun is not visible, it shouldn't be in the model, the direct illuminance component will be zero and the global will equal the diffuse illuminance.

This is assuming you are using my old SSLD sky generator / cal file.  Could be a different story if you're using something else?

Cheers,
Phil.

has a comment on it...

I am currently using gensky to find the brightness levels and sun 
position required to use the SSLD skies. Now I am wondering whether this 
combination hides some risks.

First, when I add a gensky-sun to the ssld-sky, in my understanding this 
should not change the horizontal illuminance but be kind of a technical 
optimization, replacing the bright glow spot where the sun is seen by a 
source of type light, thus making sure that shadow-test actually hit it. 
This would require the flux of the sky (glow) part to be covered to be 
the same as the flux of the sun light source.

Second, gensky manipulates the sun position when coming close to the 
zenith and sets it to 87.5 altitude. I am in a tropical country, where 
this 90 degrees can be reached. In such a case, I would have two suns in 
my sky definition - the one in the ssld glow source (at 90 degree) PLUS 
the gensky light source at 87.5 degree, right?

I am just trying to debug my sky setups, so any comments are appreciated :-D

Cheers Lars.

Hm, my concern was maybe a bit academic :-) For a sky with a very steep 
gradient, the sun (light) would cover the brightest spot of the sky 
(glow) - so light replaces glow. But because of the altitude 
modification gensky does for high altitudes, the sun (light) is 2.5 
degrees off the brightest spot of the sky glow - leading to light plus 
glow spot. Probably the fact that the solid angle covered by the sun is 
small, the difference is not that high, but in cases where my 
illuminance is really only due to a small circumsolar domain of the sky, 
this may lead to some higher illuminances, right? Would need some test 
models to see whether this becomes visible with a skylight. I just 
realized that I have two different sun positions in my model - the 
'real' one by the ssld background sky, and the manipulated on by gensky.

Yes, I am using you cal-file, thank you by the way :-)

Cheers

Lars.

OK - thanks for the explanation.  All clearer now!

I'm thinking that this shouldn't really cause you much problems.  You may be right that the sun will block that part of the sky nearest to the solar position, but that part of the sky that is blocked will be really small, and much less bright than the sun, so it should (I think?) make very little, to no, difference.  And because the diffuse sky is only part of the indirect calculation, a small change in directionality should again be almost unnoticeable.

BTW, you could always set the sun direction input for the SSLD definition (A8, A9, A10) equal to that generated by gensky?

Cheers!
Phil.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0908120857050.2865@rygar.gpcc.itd.umich.edu>

All this talk of Radiance skies made me remember that I recently 
implemented part of Preetham, Shirley, Smits, "A Practical, 
Analytical Model for Daylight" for Radiance. It's rough around 
the edges, but produces good (if not totally accurate) results.

Specifically, I modeled the part that determines the sky color 
and brightness, not the part that determines the color shift for 
faraway objects due to atmospheric scattering (maybe I'll have 
that done by the Radiance User Conference this year).

To use it, first run gensky (as normal), but comment out the 
brightfunc description and add a new colorfunc entry. The real 
arguments are turbidity and sun direction (copy the last 3 
entries from the brightfunc line), like this example for a sky 
after sunset:

#void brightfunc skyfunc
#2 skybr skybright.cal
#0
#7 1 9.75e-01 4.02e-01 2.68e-01 -0.918161 0.378882 -0.115887

void colorfunc skyfunc
4 skyr skyg skyb utah.cal
0
4 2. -0.918161 0.378882 -0.115887

Like gensky, to use it attach it to a glow source:

skyfunc glow skydome
0 0 4  1. 1. 1. 0
skydome source sky
0 0 4  0 0 1  180
skydome source sky2
0 0 4  0 0 -1  180

So, for the sample scene file attached, run:

% oconv duskscene.rad > duskscene.oct
% rvu -vp 1 -5 2 -vd -1 5 -1.5 -vh 90 -vv 90 -ab 2 -ad 512 -ar 
512 -as 128 -aa 0.1 -pe -5 duskscene.oct

It isn't quite automatic yet, and it does emit some errors, 
though I hope to clean those up soon.

Would this be most useful as a command-line option to gensky? It 
would seem most applicable there. Plus, that would allow control 
over the sun color, which shifts subtly from white to orange-ish 
nearer the horizons.

Enjoy.

The sun hits a zenith of 90 at any position between the Tropic of
Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. A few degrees above and below the
tropics hit a zenith of 87.5.

A short while ago I modified and recompiled gensky, changing 87.5 to
89.9 in lines 218-225 (
http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2005-December/003118.html
).

Has anybody else done this and run into problems?

I think if the zenith is at 90.0, the -vu vector may get messy if
you're translating the gensky output into a camera showing the sun's
view, which was my reasoning for 89.9.

I did that back in the days when I compiled my own stuff. You can't
got to 90 degrees
but everything else should work. I remember that the positions I got
were still credible
and far better than the results form another algorithm I used that
distorted the sun's
path around the zenith. Gensky may be a bit inaccurate, too, but i
don't think it is
noticeable.

I checked the output by plotting a sunpath with the values I got from the gensky
comments in the output. I think Axel Jacobs has written a script to do
that but you
can use any plotting app you want.

Thomas

Hello again with a new question,

the pool I am trying to simulate has a bottom that it's depth varies. This
means that i can not use the poolcoords.cal formula as it is and i need to
make some necessary changes. The part of formula i don't understand, but i
think can not work as it is, is the following:

"floor_bin = floor(FloorXres*(Px - FloorOrigX)/FloorWidth) +
floor(FloorYres*(1 - (Py - FloorOrigY)/FloorLength))*FloorXres;"

In this formula 3 more parameters must be added in my opinion: FloorOrigZ,
FloorZres, FloorDepth.

The role of the this formula is to calculate how many points (bins) should
be used for calculating how much energy falls on them,

If someone can explain how the specific formula works [ floor(...) , Px, Py
], or give me directly a new one with the parameters of depth in it, I
whould be grateful.

Thank you in advance for your time

Sort of related to this discussion:

When diffuse and direct input parameters are taken from measurements  
(e.g. a climate file), the value for direct normal will usually be  
based on an instrument that has an acceptance angle quite a bit larger  
than the solar disc, e.g. 6 degrees for the Eppley solar tracker. So,  
a reasonable portion of the most intense circumsolar region will end  
up be apportioned to the sun luminance (actually, radiance), and  
therefore handled by the deterministic part of the calculation. This  
effect is described in more detail in Chapter 3, Section 3.2.3  
(p60-61) here:

I don't think you need to change anything in this formula. It returns
the bin number for a point (Px,Py) based on the x and y resolution.
The "depth" of the plane is not taken into account. If you would add
another component you would split the 2-d array into a 3-d array.
I don't think that's what you want to do.

>
> "floor_bin = floor(FloorXres*(Px - FloorOrigX)/FloorWidth) +

This formula returns the number of the bin for the particular
"tile" in the Xres (columns) * Yres (rows) grid.

floor_bin = column position + ( row position * columns)

floor() is the math formula to return the next smaller integer number.

It's easy to understand if you replace all the variables with
actual values. Example:

FloorXres = 13
FloorYres = 17
FloorOrigX = 0
FloorOrigY = 0
FloorWidth = 26
FloorLength = 34

Px = 5.67
Py = 12.34

floor_bin = floor( 13 * ( 5.67 - 0 ) / 26 ) + floor( 17 * ( 1 - ( 12.34 - 0
) / 34 ) ) * 13

floor_bin = floor( 13 * rel X position ) + floor ( 17 * ( 1 - rel Y postion)
) * 13

Z is not taken into account here.

Not "how many" bins but "which" bin. The "how many" is set by Xres and Yres.

I hope you can go on with the explanation above. If your floor slopes down
you might have adjust the area of the floor relative to a horizontal plane.
But that should be all.

Hmm, well no suggestions thus far has helped solve the problem I am
having. I think it would help if I explain what I am trying to do. I am
attempting to validate radiosity calculations against a raytracer (in
this case Radiance). I am doing this with a simple example of a box lit
only by direct sun and ambient bounces, so there is no sky distribution.

I have attempted many different rendering options, such as -aa 0 and many 
other "high quality" level options as recommended in the Rendering with
Radiance book. These do not get rid of the problem. As you can see in my
gensky below, the sun shouldn't be approaching the zenith, as it has been 
revealed can cause problems. 

I was reccommended to try using mkillum to turn the window into an illum
surface. I have attempted this, but it doesn't appear to do anything, so
I could be using it incorrectly? I am only using a single ambient bounce
in my calculations because the shadow is still there even on higher
amounts, such as -ab 20. I decided -ab 1 would make it easier to track
down the problem as well as take less computation time.

Any more thoughts on what could be causing this? Could it be a problem
with gensky similar to the zenith problem maybe?

Can you send me your scene description, so I can have a look at it?   
This is the worst possible timing for me, but you're going to get  
nowhere unless you share your scene files.  It's impossible to deduce  
what's going wrong from an image.

John,

I'd also like to see your scene, but while I wait I'll go out on a limb:
AFAIK in radiance, an ambient sample ray is never emitted normal to a
surface.  I suspect your shadow results from the (slightly) decreased
probability of sampling the highlight from the area directly above the
highlight.  This effect can be compounded by the -as setting (which never
samples the upper edge of a division, but can sample the lower edge of a
division).

My suggestion: try a high ad value coupled with no ambient super samples.
-ad 20000 -as 0  


As far as your comparison between raytracing and radiosity, You pick a scene
that plays to all the strengths of radiosity.  Radiosity with a dense mesh
produces a highly accurate result in relatively little time for scenes that
have very simple geometry and are limited to completely diffuse reflection
and completely specular transmission.

If you had semi-specular reflection, semi-diffuse transmission or complex
geometry raytracing is more likely to result in higher accuracy in less time
than radiosity.

Wow, reducing the -as to 0 seems to have relieved the problem. I had no
idea that they don't shoot directly up (I had guessed it might have been
something along those lines, but couldn't track it down).

The RwR book seems to suggest that you use a -as equal to 1/4 your -ad,
so I can't imagine that reducing the -as to 0 should be the correct
solution... Perhaps the model I am using simply exacerbates this issue?

Could you explain when it's reasonable to use -as 0 and a large -ad, as
opposed to the values recommended in the book? Does it depend on the size 
of the highlight on the floor (smaller = more/less -as  )?

Naturally like you suggested Andrew, this model is much faster to do with 
radiosity. It's really just a test model, and naturally more complex
models would have to be used. However after I saw this, I naturally
couldn't proceed with image comparisons until I figured out what I was
doing wrong! As you've probably seen, I've sent out the scene, so if you
have any further insights, especially into what rpict options I should be 
using, do tell.

John,

I'm running your scene and am witnessing the same effect.  Interestingly the
dark spot still exists, it is just much less pronounced.

I am both able and unable to understand why this works.

Years ago I remember someone mentioning the impossibility of ambient
sampling normal to a surface and it's lingered in my mind ever since.  I've
always struggled with the ambient calculation's ability to sample the
horizon which technically contributes nothing to illuminance at a point
while it was unable to sample the zenith which contributes most to
illuminance.

I've thought about suggesting the range for ambient sampling switch from
[0,1) to (0,1]  but couldn't grasp the ramifications of the possibility of
sampling the zenith from all of the zenith adjacent ambient divisions.

It seems to me that statistically it isn't possible for this to make a
difference so maybe there is a bug in the ambient super sampling,  but it
also seems to me that statistically this must make a difference.

So I guess I'll just have to wait for Greg and others to weigh in...

Hi John,

I spent a little time looking at your model, and there are some  
irregularities that I'm not sure are intentional.  Specifically, I  
rendered a view from the darker region of the ceiling looking down  
like so:

-------------- next part --------------



(apologies for breaking my own rule about not attaching images, but  
I'm in a rush and I shrunk it down quite a bit)

The light patch is the one seen at the bottom of your original view,  
but the dark patch below it (actually towards the camera in your first  
view) is peculiar.  It appears to be an opening, where light goes but  
does not return.  Was this what you meant to do?  Are you radiosity  
calculations OK with this?  Infinite rays may cause some oddities in  
the interpolation, which I think is at least part of what we are  
seeing in the 10-20% level drop in the dark patch on the ceiling.

Setting -aa 0 reduces this problem considerably, since it turns the  
indirect interpolation off altogether, but something is noticeable  
even so.  (I suggested setting -aa 0 in my first reply by the way -- I  
thought you had tried that.)  The only way to get rid of the dip  
entirely is to set -as 0 as well.  You may have to increase -ad at the  
same time.  Let's explain why this is so...

The -as samples are sent only to those places where Radiance  
determines there is significant variance.  If you don't send out  
enough initial samples, then the additional samples may not go where  
they need to.  The polar region is doubly-cursed with respect to the - 
as setting, because the sampling density is low at the zenith AND  
there is no check for "over the top" differences.  Thus, the zenith  
region tends to be underestimated if all the variance is there.

Hah -- looks like Andy arrived at the same conclusion, though a bit  
more speculatively.  Well done!

There are methods for sampling a hemisphere without the singularity at  
the zenith, but they are a lot trickier to implement.

The dark patch should be the window opening. The ground glow has been removed

Hi John,

Even without this funny sampling behavior I think there could be a slightly darker patch on the ceiling due to the 1/3 x 1/3 square on the adjacent wall that has a 0% reflectance.  That dark portion of the ceiling could just have a stronger coupling to the 0% reflectance surface than the other surfaces around.  Do your radiosity renderings show any darker spots on the ceiling?

Cheers,
Zack

I might agree with you, but I think if it was the window, then not only
the ceiling, but also the right and left walls would probably have dark
spots on them as well (maybe also the backwall?). It should be noted that 
the dark spot is always directly above the highlight on the floor as the
time of day changes. I don't really understand what you mean by coupling, 
but I don't believe that the shadow is related to the window, rather it
is related to the highlight on the floor. If I change the shape of the
aperture to an asymmetrical shape, such as a square with a triangle on
top, then the shadow on the ceiling seems to be a mirror image of the
highlight on the floor, rather than a projection of the window. Note that 
the two would have the triangle shape on opposite sides of the ceiling
shadow. I'm not sure if that helps answer your question.

The radiosity program I am using does not create a shadow in that
location, (or on other walls either). I believe if anything, radiosity
might simply be darker/lighter in general.

I agree with John that the root cause of the shadow is the sampling behavior
of Radiance.  With only one ambient bounce the black hole in the window, and
the walls in general shouldn't affect the luminance of the ceiling.

If there were more than one bounce, than the black hole would be a factor,
but it would probably be much less defined as all surfaces in the room see
the hole. 

One way to test is to fill in the hole and create a polygon with glow
material to replace the sun patch on the floor.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Problem with refraction in Dielectric material
Message-ID: <20090820145839.5kaflpnfk08sk0cg@webmail.polimi.it>

Dear all,
I am running a simulation test to asses if Radiance calculates  
correctly the refraction inside a dielectric material. (Snell law   
n1*sin(A1) = n2sin(A2) ).


I build up two identical geometry one with a dielectric pane and the  
second without. The direct light can pass through a gap between two  
plastic surfaces.


Using just direct calculation (sun) I should have two identical bright  
stripes in dimension but the one passing through the dielectric panel  
should be shifted due to the refraction in the dielectric pane.

I copy and paste down the geometry and the material definition.

I am running the following command:

cat  sensor.grd  |rtrace -h -I -ab 0  test-1.oct  | rcalc -e  
'$1=47.4*$1+120*$2+11.6*$3'  > test-1-sensor1.out

the file sensor.grd is the list of my sensor:

X Y Z  0 0 1

where:

"X" is 2500 (for the case of the dielectric panel) or 7500 (for the  
case without the dielectric panel)

"Y" is changing between 10 and 5000 (with a step of 0.1)

"Z" is 0.01

the simulation results are not clear to me.

Hi Francesco.

A couple of comments:

If I understand correctly you are trying to render an image of a beam of
light passing through
a dielectric material. If you try to create an image you should use the
rpict program and not
the 'rtrace' command line you used.

You mention that you don't understand the results but you don't show us what
they are.
The output of your command line should give you lux values but I don't know
how the
input relates to the geometry (haven't looked at it close enough).

Your scene description below is incomplete. There are some '0's missing in
the descriptions.
I hope that is an effect of copy-and-paste. Otherwise I doubt that the
simulation would run
at all.

Do you know about the docs in

http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer

in particular

http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/materials.pdf


Regards
Thomas

Hi Francesco,

Radiance doesn't compute "caustics" directly -- refractions of beam  
radiation through dielectric materials.  You can visualize the  
displacement of light rays by looking through a dielectric solid, but  
the beams of light will not be translated by default.  (It is possible  
to get such behavior using the prism types, but it's not provided as a  
default behavior because such modeling is expensive and not required  
by most architectural environments.)

Best,
-Greg

Dear thomas,
I am not rendering a picture. I would like to calculate the  
illuminance value on
different sensors using rtrace to calculate the real position of the  
bright stripes on the "floor" and the dimensions.
I attache now part of the result (result-ff.txt) that I obtained with  
my simulations. If you look into the file you can understand that  
radiance seems to calculate correctley the start point of both stripe  
(last two columns): the bright stripe for the case without the  
dilectric panel (4th column) starts at point 2454mm (Y value) far from  
the origin and the bright stripe for the case of the dielectric panel  
(5th column) starts at point 2454.9mm (a bit further due to the ray  
refraction inside the dielectric material). But both the two stripes  
end at point 2553.9mm and there is no more shifting.

I also attach the rad files  (geometry-rad and sky.rad) and my script  
(calc-refr.run) and the two sensors files (points1 and points2.grd).

Thank you very much in advance.
Francesco

Francesco.

As Greg already wrote, Radiance is not suited for your type of calculation.

The difference in your results files might be caused by interpolation of
cached
values. You are calculating tiny steps (0.1units) in a large geometry (10000
units).
I wouldn't trust Radiance to produce absolutely accurate results on that
scale and
the differce you see is less than 2 units.

You can try to disable the ambient cache completely by setting -aa to 0. No
need
for an ambient cache file, then.

Sotiris, imo, in that view you are viewing only the light source and pfilt, by default, doesnt use light sources to obtain the image exposure, so pfilt cant get the image average exposure and shows that error, you can add pfilt=-a in your rif file to include the light source,

Regards
Ignacio

This is the error you get when your picture contains nothing but zero  
pixels.  See earlier responses to your queries as to why.

The suggestion with pfilt=-a did work. Thank you Ignacio very much. Thank
you also Greg for the theoritical backround.

hi Giovanni, the test01_sky.rad file includes the bright function 
definition of the sky but does noy apply it to any geometry, probably 
you need to include the sky definition, i cant try it because i have not 
the perezlum.cal file

skyfunc glow sky_glow
0
0
4 1 1 1  0

sky_glow source sky
0
0
4 0 0 1 180

Regards,
Ignacio

Thanks Ignacio,

Of course!
Now I see that was a pretty silly question! Thanks!
