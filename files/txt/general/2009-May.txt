Hi Marija, hi Jack

Thanks for your mails.
Some glass types I want to simulate are not in the IGDB, so I will
describe the glasses with the measurements-method,
but I am not really sure I have understood this method properly. There
are those precisions that make radiance so great, but sometimes also
difficult to learn. Could you tell me if this would be then right as
follows?

This is the hole double glazing geometry description:

#window geometry:

double_glazing_a    polygon    window
0
0
12    0        -0.18    0
        0        -0.18    3.34
       4.13    -0.18    3.34
       4.13    -0.18    0

Then I should measure the interior pane (a laminated float glass with an
interlayer) and separately the exterior pane (a 4 mm float glass). The
hole input data are then:

Red: 700nm --     rf1_r    rb1_r     rf2_r     rb2_r    t1_r     t2_r
Green: 546nm -- rf1_g    rb1_g    rf2_g    rb2_g    t1_g    t2_g
Blue: 436 --         rf1_b    rb1_b    rf2_b    rb2_b    t1_b    t2_b

Then substitute these in the formel you said and this would be the
complete description of the double glazing material:

#window material:

void BRTDfunc double_glazing_a
10
if(Rdot,cr(fr(rf1_r),ft(t1_r),fr(rf2_r)),cr(fr(rb2_r),ft(t2_r),fr(rb1_r)))
if(Rdot,cr(fr(rf1_g),ft(t1_g),fr(rf2_g)),cr(fr(rb2_g),ft(t2_g),fr(rb1_g)))
if(Rdot,cr(fr(rf1_b),ft(t1_b),fr(rf2_b)),cr(fr(rb2_b),ft(t2_b),fr(rb1_b)))
ft(t1_r)*ft(t2_r)
ft(t1_g)*ft(t2_g)
ft(t1_b)*ft(t2_b)
        0 0 0
        glaze2.cal

0
9
        0 0 0
        0 0 0
        0 0 0



I also try to understand how this calculation system is related to the
physical process. So I have another question.
If I measure with a spectrometer the complete normal reflectance and
transmittance of a double glazing, the interior reflectances are already
in the total measurement. So I understand that, also when in the
physical reality the total reflectance of a double glazing could be the
input data for the simulation, the calculation system of radiance
calculates only right if you specify the interior reflectances and the
calculation take place within the BRTD function. Am I right on that?

Thanks again,

Marina






Hi Marina,

Yes you want to describe the glass geometry, that is one polygon
representing the multiple layers of the physical makeup. The material is
what should represent the behavior. If you take the output from Optics
and run it through optics2rad you will get a single BRTDfunc material
description. One thing to be careful of is that this is dependent on the
correct orientation (normal) of the glass geometry. I believe that the
normal is supposed to be pointing "into" the interior of the building.
One way to check normal orientation in radiance is to assign
(temporaryily) a "glow" material to the glass geometry and view it. The
sides that are "black" are the back sides of the geometry, the sides
that are not black are the positive normal side.

Marina -

I have not followed this thread very closely, so I don't know exactly what
you are trying to model in Radiance, but thought I would make one comment,
which may or may not be useful.

You say that the constructions you are trying to model are not in the IGDB,
and then you say that you want to model a laminate. 

I just want to make sure that you know you can make a laminate in Optics,
depending on what you are using for the glass and interlayer values.

There is a detailed write-up of how to make laminates in Optics on our
Optics Knowledge Base website:

http://windows.lbl.gov/materials/optics5/CurrentVersion/Optics_Knowledge_Bas
e.htm

Click on the link for "NFRC Procedure for Creating Laminates" and you will
get to another page, and there you can click on "Laminate Procedures" for
the detailed description of the process. Here is a direct link to that PDF:

Hello Thomas,

Must say, I love your exporter.

I have my (undergraduate Architecture and Interior Architecture)
students using it for a project this week. 

Systems: Microsoft XP/Pro | Linux Kubuntu 8.10 via vmplayer

I have noticed the following issues:
1) Path name: will not export if there are spaces in the path name.
2) Parallel views are exported as vtv (perspective) rather than (vtl)
and the view height seems to be very high compared to the camera height
when the view was set.

For the future...
Would be useful to document how to add new sky programs...

We use the genrad program (Simon Crone
http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au/R?func=dbin-jump-full&object_id=1313
3&local_base=gen01-era02 pages 49-54)
http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2007-February/
004202.html which adds the a new option for skies. According to the
author genrad supplies the direct and diffuse radiation to the standard
gensky/gendaylit programs to produce better accuracy than the CIE skies.
Parameters include altitude and turbity.
  genrad -a xxx -o xxx -m xxx -O 0

Hi Robin, hi All

yes I want to simulate a laminated glass in a double glass system. This
laminated glass is a prototyp of a glazing system and there is no
information about it anywhere. It is also a quite complicated system
with embeded coating and interlayer and I can get its description from
Optics5. That's why I think the way to describe this glasses are with
the spectrometer measurements.

I am still not sure anyway if I describe the glasses propertly.
Does anybody knows if this is right like this:

#window geometry:

double_glazing_a    polygon    window
0
0
12    0        -0.18    0
        0        -0.18    3.34
       4.13    -0.18    3.34
       4.13    -0.18    0


#window material:

void BRTDfunc double_glazing_a
10
if(Rdot,cr(fr(rf1_r),ft(t1_r),fr(rf2_r)),cr(fr(rb2_r),ft(t2_r),fr(rb1_r)))
if(Rdot,cr(fr(rf1_g),ft(t1_g),fr(rf2_g)),cr(fr(rb2_g),ft(t2_g),fr(rb1_g)))
if(Rdot,cr(fr(rf1_b),ft(t1_b),fr(rf2_b)),cr(fr(rb2_b),ft(t2_b),fr(rb1_b)))
ft(t1_r)*ft(t2_r)
ft(t1_g)*ft(t2_g)
ft(t1_b)*ft(t2_b)
        0 0 0
        glaze2.cal

0
9
        0 0 0
        0 0 0
        0 0 0

where I just have to substitute the next measured data:

Red: 700nm --     rf1_r    rb1_r     rf2_r     rb2_r    t1_r     t2_r
Green: 546nm -- rf1_g    rb1_g    rf2_g    rb2_g    t1_g    t2_g
Blue: 436 --         rf1_b    rb1_b    rf2_b    rb2_b    t1_b    t2_b

Hi Marina,

Looks about right to me -- does it reproduce the combined  
transmittance and reflectance you're measuring?  Are the interfaces  
separated by an air gap, or are some/all layers laminated with an  
optical adhesive?  In the latter case, the functions in glaze2.cal  
won't compute the correct combined transmittance and reflectances.

Hi Greg,

first of all, there is a mistake in my previous mail. I wanted to say
< and I cannot get its description from Optics5.>

It is the latter case:
outside the laminate (glass pane + optical adhesive coating +... +
interlayer + ... + adhesive coating + glass) then the air gap and the
inside that is a float glass.
(It is a switchable glass in a double glazing)

How can I then describe this glasses?

(I have the possibility to measure the double glazing or the different
layers separately)
Just a naive idea that could helps:

If the combined R and T are the ones resulting from the hole double
glazing which could be measured in the spectrometer if I measure the
complete double glass and not the separated layers:

Total Reflectance front
Total Reflectance back
Total Transmitance

Could be with this data a way to describe them?

Hi Marina,

I think you had best treat this as a two-glazing system, and use  
glaze2.cal similar to how you suggested in your previous e-mail.   
You'll need to measure the transmittance and front/back reflectances  
of each piece of glazing (laminated and float), and provide these as  
the inputs to your BRTDfunc model.  You could even use the glazing  
script as is if your float glass is close enough to a standard clear  
glazing by providing your own definition of the other glass as input  
a la:

	http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009- 
January/005665.html

I hope this helps.

Hi Greg,

thanks.

What I actually try to do in a part of my current research is a
comparative study of the daylight efficiency of different glass systems
and some of this glasses are switchable, so thanks the link.
>From your answer, I guess that the glaze2.cal is not the exact script to
this ones although the results will be quite accurate.

The method that Jack describes has some points that I can understand at
the moment, so I have tried (for the moment) the first method:

void BRTDfunc double_glazing_a
10
if(Rdot,cr(fr(0.075),ft(0.831),fr(0.153)),cr(fr(0.188),ft(0.158),fr(0.075)))
if(Rdot,cr(fr(0.075),ft(0.899),fr(0.134)),cr(fr(0.150),ft(0.215),fr(0.082)))
if(Rdot,cr(fr(0.083),ft(0.88),fr(0.141)),cr(fr(0.150),ft(0.195),fr(0.083)))
ft(0.831)*ft(0.158)
ft(0.899)*ft(0.215)
ft(0.88)*ft(0.195)
0 0 0
glaze2.cal

0
9
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0


and the results looks like right, but just to be sure:

the descrition of:

mod glass id
0
0
3 rtn gtn btn

is not included in this cases of double glazing. Is it right?
and, it is only included, I guess after your mails, only in monolitic
not double glazings, isn't it?

Hi Marina,

That is correct.  The "glass" type is only suitable for single-pane  
glazings, and simple ones at that.

Best,
-Greg

Message-ID: <694e132c0905070955j12b7206ag945f9e4de79d0295@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Is anybody able to get the i command in ximage to work? I've tried it on
Ubuntu (8.04 and 9.04) without luck. It's supposed to draw a random color
for all pixels similar to  the pixel selected, effectively giving you an
isoline. It's talked about in section 7.3 in RwR.

Thanks in advance,

--Dave

This only works with the -c 256 option and only on servers that  
support color-mapped visuals.  Many modern servers do not support  
this option, so the 'i' command won't work.  You'll have to use  
falsecolor -cl.

Can anyone tell me if 3d max is certified daylighting calculation
software? I guess what I'm asking is, is it suitable for use in design
engineers to use as proof of compliance with design standards?

Hi Marina,

Looks about right to me -- does it reproduce the combined  
transmittance and reflectance you're measuring?  Are the interfaces  
separated by an air gap, or are some/all layers laminated with an  
optical adhesive?  In the latter case, the functions in glaze2.cal  
won't compute the correct combined transmittance and reflectances.

Yes daylight factors but in general terms. I do lots of artificial
lighting design using Dialux which is CIE accredited and the output is
recognised as acceptable for building compliance. I just wasn't sure if
3d max was?

Thanks for responding so quickly tho, much appreciated.

Message-ID: <fdd7db810905090536v67a056e1w389bb9dc910b2f8@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list,
I have tried to run the optics2rad script, but the only output I get
is the information behind the # in the file from optics, implying that
rcalc in the optics2rad script, do not get any information...Have
anyone experience with this?

My approach is simply to write
optics2rad followed by the name of the file from optics.
Do I need further commands to run the optics2rad script?

Hi Anne,

Thanks for sharing the file.  For some reason, Optics dropped a  
critical line from its output, making the actual scene description  
illegal and breaking the optics2rad translator.  Both BRTDfunc  
descriptors were missing a critical '.' in their description.  Yours  
look like this:

void  BRTDfunc    ANTELIOSILVER6mm_front
10
       0.267     0.321     0.395
       0.678     0.655     0.576
       0 0 0

0
9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

when they should look like this:

void  BRTDfunc    ANTELIOSILVER6mm_front
10
       0.267     0.321     0.395
       0.678     0.655     0.576
       0 0 0
       .
0
9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

------------
I don't actually know what happened to the period, but reinserting  
it, optics2rad works again, producing:


void BRTDfunc ANTELIOSILVER6mm
10
         rR_clear rG_clear rB_clear
         0.678*tR_clear   0.655*tG_clear   0.576*tB_clear
      0 0 0
      window.cal
0
15 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
         0.267       0.321    0.395

Hello forum,


With the following command the editor launches instead of the rview.

*********************
sajjad@sajjad:~/MyStuff/Radiance/chapt1$ rview -vp 2.25 .375 1 -vd -.25 .125
-.125 -av .5 .5 .5 test.oct
VIM - Vi IMproved 7.1 (2007 May 12, compiled Jan  8 2009 03:06:24)
Unknown option argument: "-.25"
More info with: "vim -h"


*******************'**


I am running ubuntu and i have installed radiance as  a debian package.


Have anyone encountered that before?


Regards
Sajjad

Yes, it comes up in this mailing list every 1-2 months. rview has been renamed to rvu quite a long time ago just because of this confict, so please use rvu instead of rview, it should work exactly the same way.

Hi Greg,

I seem to have run into a similar issue as reported by Anne where  
optics2rad only sends out the header information of the optics file.    
I've checked the optics file and it has the "."  you describe in the  
correct location:

void  BRTDfunc    SB60 Starphire_8_front
10
       0.050     0.057     0.073
       0.795     0.815     0.777
       0 0 0
       .
0
9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

void  BRTDfunc    SB60 Starphire_8_back
10
       0.044     0.051     0.037
       0.795     0.815     0.777
       0 0 0
       .
0
9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0


Anyone else having the same results?
Thanks!
Best regards,
Chris Humann

Hi Chris,

One problem that I see is the name of the two materials contains a space 
after SB60. This would need to be fixed for a valid radiance material name.

Hi Jack,

Thanks, good eye.   Unfortunately even with the material name fixed  
I'm still not getting output beyond the header.

Hi Chris,

Why is your description missing the "glass" descriptor Optics usually  
produces?  The optics2rad script is a bit fragile to such  
oversights.  Maybe you just took it out for brevity.

In any case, the optics2rad script doesn't like underscores in names  
any better than it likes Spaces.  The only underscore you can have is  
before the final "_glass", "_front" or "_back".  The issue is not  
with Radiance but with the rcalc program, which looks for the end of  
the name by searching for an underscore.  Not much way around it, I'm  
afraid.  All three names need to be identical as well, e.g.:

void glass SB60-Starphire-8_glass
0
0
3 .95 .95 .95

void  BRTDfunc    SB60-Starphire-8_front
10
       0.050     0.057     0.073
       0.795     0.815     0.777
       0 0 0
       .
0
9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

void  BRTDfunc    SB60-Starphire-8_back
10
       0.044     0.051     0.037
       0.795     0.815     0.777

Hi Greg,
Thanks for the response.  I did take out the glass descriptor for  
brevity.    I may have corrupted my optics2rad script somehow as it's  
still a no go even with the name changes you suggested.
Chris

Hi Chris,

Try doing the following. Take the radiance output from optics5 and run 
it through xform. For example:

    xform optics_output_filename > my_glass.rad
    optics2rad my_glass.rad

Thanks Jack,

That was the silver bullet!    Despite reinstalling Greg's script I  
was still getting no where.   I use Textmate for all my radiance  
scripting and perhaps it was adding a hidden character somewhere that  
the c-shell didn't like.

This is great, thanks again!

Chris

Hi Chris,

Good glad it worked. It actually only just occurred to me that this 
might be a way to get a well formated radiance description that rcalc 
would be happy with. As Greg mentioned optics2rad calls on rcalc to do 
most of the work. Rcalc is very sensitive to the input format that it 
expects, unfortunately this can be a bit difficult to track down. Note I 
did also do an export of some dummy data from optics5 and this went into 
optics2rad without any problem. So it may be that if you are using some 
intermediate script in your process that it is somehow munging the 
format along the way. One simple thing to check for is if you have a 
carriage return at the last line of the input file that your script is 
generating or outputing for optics2rad processing.

-Jack

Subject: [Radiance-general] problem with import Radiance resutlt to ECOTECT
Message-ID: <254e0dda0905111917l5296b959k91584b03d911cd9e@mail.gmail.com>

I built a model in ECOTECT and exported to RADIANCE to calculate daylight
performance. However, when i finished and i imported the result file with
.OK extension to ECOTECT. I can not. ECOTECT said "invalid file format"
Furthermore, it is the same thing with DAYSIM, when i imported DA file. Can
anyone tell me what is the problem?

Best Regards!

Vincent. Are you using a grid or point attributes on surfaces?  .ok  
and .da files will only work on a grid. Point attributes needs a bit  
of a workaround but can be done.

Dear colleagues:

 

I am planning to introduce HDR imagery in my daylighting class in the
fall using Photosphere. My understanding is that I will need a CCD
camera, a wide-angle/fisheye lense and a luminance meter to calibrate
the camera. Could anybody recommend any specific products that I should
buy? Has anybody compiled Photosphere under Windows (sorry GregJ).

 

Thanks a lot,

Hi Christoph,

I'm cross-posting my reply to the HDRI mailing list, where this  
probably belongs.

I hired a programmer friend of mine to port Photosphere to Windows  
and Linux a few years ago, but she has since had two children and is  
a busy mom.  I'm not sure where that project stands, to be honest.  I  
know it is possible to compile the command-line tool hdrgen under  
Windows with some effort, but it hasn't been done for many a year.

The Canon 5D camera with Sigma fisheye is a good choice, and Sigma  
has a 180-degree fisheye that works on APS sensors now as well, so  
you could get a Nikon D90 (or whatever) and use that as a lower-cost  
alternative.

Cheers,
-Greg

Hi Christoph,

We've had pretty good success using the Sigma 4.5mm fisheye on a Nikon  
D40.   The images do need to be calibrated for which we use a Minolta  
CS-100a luminance meter.  We found the latter on E-Bay for a fraction  
of the price of a new one.  A colleague has a Nikon Coolpix P-1 point  
and shoot which seems to be spot on, needing no calibration  (perhaps  
because Greg has the same camera?:)).

Hi Christoph,

I have a 5D and  Sigma 180 fisheye. I would be happy to bring them by 
sometime if you are interested in checking them out.

Actually, if we are on the topic of porting applications a port of the 
canoncap application would be pretty nice....

Best,

-Jack

Hi all-

 

I'm being asked increasingly to perform more daylighting and artificial
daylight studies.  I typically use IES Virtual Environment as the
interface for Radiance, and I find I like it a fair amount, in terms of
ease-of-use.  Since this is where I started using Radiance, I'm
wondering if anyone has any insights into what IES Virtual Environment
can/cannot do when compared to scripting from scratch.  Anyone offering
insight here would be greatly appreciated.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Rendering large space with small detail
Message-ID: <63252a3e0905181719v7a01d6d4saf4a60f0aa73550@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,



I?m using Ecotect as the geometry interface and file generator to Radiance.



For day-lighting purposes, I?m modelling a large space which includes areas
of small detail. After many lengthy iterations (20+ hours for each
simulation) the best image I could generate is the image attached.



My problems are the splotchy nature of the light being reflected off the
ceiling space and the baffled louvers under the skylight. The render
settings that I used to generate the image are as follows;



  *-dp=*

*-ar=*

*-ms=*

*-ds=*

*-dt=*

*-dc=*

*-dr=*

*-sj=*

*-st=*

*-ab=*

*-af=*

*-aa=*

*-ad=*

*-as=*

*-av=*

*-lr=*

*-lw=*

0.7

0.1

8

RCP.amb

0.1

1023

512

0.01 0.01 0.01

6

0



I?ve increased the accuracy of the variables which I thought were critical
to the accuracy of this particular render. These were; ambient resolution
(ar), ambient bounces (ab), ambient accuracy (aa), ambient divisions (ad)
and ambient super-samples (as).



Is it a case of increasing the accuracy of these specific variables further
or is there an easier or quicker way to achieve better rendering?



Any help would be greatly appreciated.



Thanks,

Paul.

Hi Paul,

Bottom line, the easiest way to avoid splotchy artifacts is to bring  
the direct light contributions closer and closer to the surfaces  
visible in the image. I'm having a hard time understanding what the  
lighting design is in this image. There seems to be a cove or  
something on the left, and some baffled ceiling condition to the right  
of that, that changes in plan. maybe you could describe the lighting  
design and the section of that ceiling? Where is the skylight and what  
is the section of that in relation to this scene? What are the  
characteristics of the media between the external daylight and the  
interior scene? That information might inform a solution to these  
rendering issues (because there may be a solution to them that takes  
less than 20 hours to get results better than what you have posted).  
Either way, for a scene this apparent size, the -ar seems low right  
off the bat; also, the -ab is way high for an image (generally  
speaking); and the -ad and -as are probably too low.

Hi Rob,

Thanks for your help.

I'll try to explain better what is happening in the image. As you look at
the image you are looking down the spine of a supermarket mall. Right in
front of the camera position is a void in the floor to the ground floor
below. On the immediate left (I assume this is the 'cove' you talk about) is
another space perpendicular to the mall which is a food court. To the right
and left are glazed shop fronts with the first shop front on the left
showing a reflection of the scene behind the camera position. The cubic
looking geometry are 1m high kiosks in the centre of the mall space. The
baffles hanging from the ceiling are internal shading devices which are
hiding a horizontal skylight above which stretches the length of the mall.
The left top strip of baffles are external shading devices covering the
vertical clerestory windows which again run the length of the mall.

The electric lighting you can see inside the shops fronts are very generic
and are simply there so that the shops don't look like dungeons for the
purpose of the image. The primary focus and motivation for the image is the
day light conditions in the mall space and so the mall space has no electric
lighting - just the shops.

The outside ambient conditions are a uniform sky.

You say;

'the easiest way to avoid splotchy artifacts is to bring the direct light
contributions closer and closer to the surfaces visible in the image'

I'm unsure exactly what you mean here as the direct light contributions are
the external sky and therefore how would you bring this closer to the
surfaces to create better resolution?

Thanks for your reccomendations on the variables, I'll try doubling the
variables you said were too low and seeing if that has a better effect.

Cheers,

Paul.

Hi,

as Rob said, bringing the light source closer to the scene is a good 
start ;-) You can do this in your case by using the gensky modifier for 
your horizontal skylight's glazing, instead of defining a glass pane 
plus an outside sky dome (I assume that you do not have any visible 
geometry that is seen through the horizontal skylight). The second is 
that in your case, it may be possible to define an mkillum surface in 
the vertical clerestory windows. This would produce an uniform illum 
source accounting for the external blinds and certainly help a lot to 
improve rendering times with acceptable image quality.

I would try to go with such a set-up. Replace the (vertical) clerestory 
glazing with a mkillum surface, the (horizontal) skylight glazing with 
the gensky modifier, and set higher ambient paramters as Rob suggested 
(and set a lower -ab, 2 or 3 should be fine with a good -av value!!!).

In case this is not enough - one COULD try to introduce a second mkillum 
surface below the internal shades, as these probably also are a bit 
tricky to calculate. In this case, one would place a gensurf-generated 
surface just below the internal shades, with a resolution to account for 
variations in the structure (I would try something like 4x4 from what I 
see on the image), which will be invisible, but replace all ambient 
calculations on top of the internat shades by 4x4 illum sources. This 
would lead to a very simple scene, with very short rendering times and 
virtually no noise. BUT - first try the other options!

CU Lars.

Is there a particular reason to use a uniform sky over the CIE overcast?

Hi John,

I want to be able to test the daylight and sun penetration in the mall space
during different sky conditions eg 9am 12pm 3pm sunny sky and also an
overcast sky. So in hindsight I should've used the CIE overcast. However,
when I simulate with sunny sky conditions I get the same resolution and
rendering problems.

Any more thoughts?

Paul.

Hi Paul,

using not the uniform sky does not solve the problem, I guess that John 
asked because the uniform sky is not really a model of what you could 
observe in nature, so few people use it for anything but testing.

To solve your problem, several comments and hints have been given, and I 
would suggest that you try these. As a note, the mkillum tool is 
actually a way to get useable results without setting ambient parameters 
too high, a performance boost so to say, In your case, you would have to 
expect really high rendering times without such techniques.

If you wonder why you see the splotchy shades, look into how Radiance is 
rendering the ambient. The problem is the limited number of sample rays 
sent out for each bounce, to random directions. So for one point, most 
rays may hit the shade, while for a point just a cm aside, which should 
receive more or less the same irradiation, you may be lucky enough to 
hit the sky with all sampled rays. And than, this calculation is not 
done for each point in space, but only if the variation exceeds limits, 
the ambient resolution enforces it, .... and so on. So you COULD set ar, 
as very high, increase the ar setting, set a low aa, and wait.

The mkillum tool will optimize the calculation a lot, as it replaces the 
complex geometry outside the scene by a light source, so that is why I 
recommended it. It is always useful in cases of so-called complex 
fenestration, and your sun-shades are. If you think very creative, you 
could even consider the layer of internal sunshades as 'complex 
fenestration' (ok, no glass, but similar problems here), so I added the 
idea to have a mkillum surface here, too. But I guess that mkillum for 
the vertical clerestory windows, skyfunc for the horizontal skylight, 
and moderate ambient settings for the scene than should give acceptable 
results.

Do you have the book "Rendering with Radiance", as well as Axel Jacobs 
tutorials? These should give you an idea why you experience problems 
with you scene, as well as strategies how to solve these. And you should 
find examples on how to use mkillum, too.

CU Lars.

Hi Christoph,

I have a 5D and  Sigma 180 fisheye. I would be happy to bring them by 
sometime if you are interested in checking them out.

Actually, if we are on the topic of porting applications a port of the 
canoncap application would be pretty nice....

Hi Paul!

I do not have much time right now, so only a short answer.

The fact that you still see the direct sun hit inside surfaces is 
expected. The illum surface just replaces the indirect component (the 
background sky and outside reflections), not the direct light, for which 
it appears to be transparent or as the secondary modifiert you use it with.

If you want to see whether everything is fine, generate the mkillum 
sources with a sky without direct sun.

Cheers

Lars.

Hi Paul,

So you're on your way. Lars has explained that mkillum will do the  
"bringing of the direct component closer to your scene" as I  
suggested. A couple of other pointers:

You want to create impostor geometry or define your skylight apertures  
as illum sources. You do this by adding "illum=" lines to the .rif  
file. Let's say you have a skylight defined by a skylight.rad file,  
that describes the polygons that make up the skylight opening; you  
would remove that reference from the "scene=" line(s) and add an  
"illum=" line. You are telling rad to take any polygons defined in the  
illum= files and do a backwards raytrace from those polygons and out  
into the scene beyond. Generally this is the exterior environment, and  
as such the rays traced stand a much better chance of hitting the sun.  
The results of this raytrace operation are saved and applied as a data  
file to the polygons defining the skylight or aperture and that  
aperture becomes a light source. I would not worry about an -av value  
for your mkillum= line, but I would definitely increase the -ab value  
to 2 or 3, and -ad 512.

You should not do anything to the .rad files from there. rad is great;  
if you tell rad (via the illum= line(s)) which surfaces should be  
precalculated as light sources, rad will manage the creation of these  
secondary light sources as they are called and create its own separate  
rad files that substitute the precalculated illums for the  
calculations and/or renderings. Definitely look at the rad manual page  
for more info on this...

Hi,
Thinking about the difference between?photorealism rendering and light
visualization?related in RWR chapter 1, pag 4 and 5.?I'd like to
elucidate some questions about this topic:
Doing so, ( procedures included below by example), is still a
phisically based simulation?
Is it a valid procedure to predict how natural light behaves inside this space?
Is it a valid method to get fast, acurate and predictive daylight calculation?

Anyway, I was frightened with plethora of variations and possibilities
to solve this problem.

thank you,

regards
Vangelis

Hi Evangelos,

I'm a little confused by your email. Are you asking about the validity  
of things such as mkillum in a predictive lighting calculation?  
Because mkillum is most definitely a physically-based approach. As  
with any simulation method, the user and his or her assumptions factor  
into the equation, but using mkillum to essentially bring the direct  
calculation closer to the surfaces of interest, when properly used, is  
most definitely a valid procedure.

Message-ID: <fdd7db810905210200j4e636747k185a3e25059ecbe0@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list,
3 questions -
I am modelling solar shading of glass panes. I have modelled them as a
combination of trans and mirror material type. The mirror material is
applied in order to take into acount the specular reflections in the pane in
direct sun. However now I have come in doubt, whether this approach is good
enough. The lamellas will be tiltet in different positions in front of the
facade and interreflections between the lamellas will occur. I want to
include the effect of the interreflections in my model.

1) Therefore question 1 is - does trans and mirror in some way take into
account the variation of reflectance and transmittance for different
incident angles? I have tried to test my "sample" with a glow sky where I
rotate the sample around the x axis. However when I am above a tilt of 45
degrees I get a reflectance of 0... ( My sample have the dimensions 3.5 x
3.5 in x and y and my rtrace point is placed close to the x axis (0.2))

2) To include the spectral dependency with different incidence angles I need
to use the BRTDfunc instead - right?

3) And as the lamellas are made of one glass pane I can use the
window.cal-file for defining my material?


Thanks!

Anne

Dear:

I am using Daysim to calculate who much energy consumption for lighting to

1, I found The total annual hours of occupancy at the work place and the
total annual hours of electric lighting are wrong. I calculated it by hands
according to the rules and methods from Tutorial. I found it is different
from the result of Daysim.

2, User Behaviour,   "Active" means "A user who operates the electric

what does "the ambient daylight conditions" mean here?  For blinds, If there
is no blinds or other shading devices in my building, how can i set this for
blinds?

3, Lighting and Shading control system.  For blinds control, I really donot
know what is the difference between set in "User Behaviour - blinds use" and
"Lighting and Shading control system - blinds control" ?  Likewise, if there
is no blinds how can i set it?  For lighting control, i tried the frist
three types, which are "Manual on/off switch near the door",  " Switch off

difference of the results between the three.

4 in my building the electric lighting is only used when the daylight does
not meet the 300 lux requirement. so who can i select the lighting control

You may need to decrease the 'specular threshhold' setting. The default
is 0.15, which crudely means that any specular reflection less than 15%
is not accounted for. Depending on how precise you want to go you could
go down to -dt .05 or less, or even to 0, but that may bog down the
calculation.

There is actually a Daysim forum that can be found in Google Groups. You
can probably get more advanced advice there, and the software authors
track that message board. I'll give some general comments:
 
First, take a look at the tutorial which may answer your questions
better than I can
http://irc.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ie/lighting/daylight/daysim/docs/DaysimTutoria
l.pdf
 
1. I'd recommend giving an example of the error you found to the Google
Group for review so it's more clear what the problem is.
 
2. I believe Daysim assumes that any time a daylight value over a
certain threshhold occurs that the user would draw the shades blinds and
cut the daylight value by an assumed percentage. If you're sure that
there will not be any shades there should be a "no blinds" option. 
 
3. The user behavior for active or passive use (or mix) basically
guesses whether occupants will actively raise blinds when glare is no
longer present or will be passive and leave them closed most of the day.
I assume it's similar for user behavior with respect to switching of
lights, but I'm not sure if that's based on daylight or occupancy.
 
The Lighting and shading controls should relate to any automated control
system for the blinds or electric lights.
 
4. Good question for the Daysim Google Group.
 
5. If you set a particular work plane sensor I believe it will predict
energy on that one particular sensor instead of some other behavior, but
check the tutorial for better explanation.

Christopher Rush : Thank you so much!

1, I defined the occupancy time is from 8:00 to 17:00. The result from
Daysim is 1568 hours totally in a year. However, i calculated it which is
1827 hours. According to the descirption of Daysim tutorial. Occupants leave
two times, one in the morning and one in the afternoon for 30 mins each time
and leave in lunchtime for one hour. So there are 9 hours from 8:00 to 17:00
one day. And occupants leave for 2 hours totally each day. So there are 7
hours occupancy time each day. Therefore, for one week there are 35 hours
from monday to friday. There are 365 days one year which is 52 weeks plus
one day.  the occupancy time for one year would be 35*52+7=1827 hours, which
is different to 1568 hours from Daysim result.

By the way, i donnot know how to calculate the total annual hours of
electric lighting in Daysim and i didnot find in Daysim tutorial. Anyone can
tell me?

2, Christopher Rush mentioned the daylight level i donot understand it. The
daylight value is the sky illuminance outside or the illuminance in the
room?  if it is for the inside room. I difined many illimance point. So
which one can control the blinds?

In my building, there is no blinds. However, i donot have the "no blinds"
option in my Daysim. what is wrong?

3, I looked the tutorial. For user behavior. it defined the active and
passive for when the blinds and lighting are open and when thay are closed.
However, in Lighting and shading control system, its function is to define
when thay are open and according to which control system, manual or other
sensor. So the two have the same function. i am confused hwo the blinds and
electric lighting perform in Daysim?

4 any one can answer this question?

5 If i define a sensor point, is the whole lighting system controlled by the
only sensor point?  if i define two. How is the lighting system controlled?

Maybe a silly idea, but as long as you are not looking at open plan 
office spaces... Are the remaining 37 days accounting for (medical, 
vacation, ...) leaves? Just thought about that as I am leaving for a 
three weeks holiday tonight :-D

Message-ID: <d3349a4f0905220327r16ad5cb8we3bc0386155187eb@mail.gmail.com>

I have windows Vista.
I installed Autocad2000 and then Desktop Radiance 2.0 but it does not work
neither with Ecotect neither in Autocad.
When i render with Ecotect the messages that I attach are appearing named
"lathos_eoctect_radiance" and "lathos_radiance_Ecotect" and in autocad the
massage named "lathos_radiance_autocad" appears.

Could you please tell me what Am I doing wrong?

Victor,

Just an idea for the first question: is your timestep small enough to  
model the 30 min absence? A timestep of one hour may give wrong  
results... You can check the intgain.csv file (in the /res directory  
of your project) for hourly information on occupancy, blind position  
and electric lighting use.

Consider posting your questions at the Daysim google group, people are  
more familiar with the problems there.

Best regards,

Wout

Dumb question, but are you sure your rays are passing through the  
window at all angles?  Is it possible that when the angle is greater  
than 45, the test ray misses the sample?

Hmmn - my text was missing...

Hi Greg,
I have checked for this. The measuring point is placed close to the xaxis,
y=0.15, and when plotting the geometry the rtrace-points are within the area
of the window (see e.g. attached pictures for glass rotation, -rx, of 10, 50
and 80, the red polygon along the x-axis and along the y-axis in x=1.75 is
just for viewing purposes).
Br
Anne

Subject: [Radiance-general] DF for a polygon
Message-ID: <705225.65902.qm@web26602.mail.ukl.yahoo.com>

Dear users,

I am calculating DF for a polygon. My approach for this is to use cnt, rcalc and rtrace as described below.

cnt 3000 4351 | rcalc -e 'x=157-$1*0.01; y=168.41-$2*0.01; z=0.85; $1=x; $2=y; $3=z; $4=0; $5=0; $6=1' > grids/grid_level_0.xyz

I then deleted the lines outside my polygon and initiated rtrace.

cat grids/grid_level_0.xyz | rtrace -I -ab 4 -aa 0.05 -ar 128 -ad 512 -as 256 -x 4351 -y 3000 -af ambfiles/df.amb -fac octrees/LSE_DF.oct > images/grid2illum_level_0.pic

which results the following error:

rtrace: fatal - unexpected EOF on input
pfilt: truncated input (y=754)
images/grid2illum_level_0_resized.pic: read error
<stdin>: read error (y==139)

Two of the errors occur when I start to work with the grid2illum_level_0.pic image. If I do not specify the picture size in the rtrace command I get the following error:

pfilt: bad picture size
images/grid2illum_level_0_resized.pic: bad picture size
images/grid2illum_level_0_resized_df.pic: bad picture size

Does this error occur because i delete points in the plane and how do I get around this this?


Best regard



Per Haugaard,

Yes, your errors are most likely resulting from deleting some of rtrace
points.  Rtrace is expecting 4351*3000 points and is getting fewer, hence
the unexpected end of file error.

>From the rtrace manual page: ?If the direction vector is (0,0,0), a bogus
record is printed...?   Instead of deleting you could change the vector to
?0 0 0? and then the area outside of your polygon would be comprised of
bogus records (zeros).   This method might not work if you are expecting
legitimate zeros in your output.

Greg, do I grasp correctly that Radiance's RGB primaries were chosen

Originally, yes.  They were selected based on the recommendations of  
Gary Meyer in an old report where he measured the chromaticities of a  
bunch of different CRT monitors.  Since then, the sRGB standard came  
out with slightly different RGB primaries, unfortunately.

Hi Lars, Rob

It looks like I have managed to get the mkillum surface to work for the
skylight. The render times are reduced and the images displayed look
different too.

However, I have been testing the use of the mkillum without the artificial
lighting turned on in my model. When I do turn them on and run them with the
parameters set to high accuracy levels, the simulation takes a very long
time. I think that any time gained by the mkillum surface is negated by the
number of lights it has to simulate.

Is there a way of simplifying the artificial lighting of the tenants either
side of the mall space? The goal of the artificial lighting in the tenancies
is not to be highly accurate but rather to give the daylight in the mall
space some context and to make it look more realistic as I?m only concerned
about the daylight in the mall. Ideally I would like to put a mkillum
surface in the position of the array of lights but I feel that this wouldn?t
help reduce the complexity of the simulation as the same number of
calculations still need to be carried out, am I right?

Is there a way in Radiance to make a planer object emit a certain amount of
uniform light?

Look forward to hearing from you,

Paul

The simulations will increase as you increase the number of light  
sources, that is a fact of life (or virtual life, as in this case).  
The mkillum process will help improve the speed and accuracy of the  
lighting simulation of the light filtering in from the skylight, but  
as you add in complexity through electric light sources, you will  
experience a delay in the simulation times, yes.

The electric lights probably aren't doing much in terms of  
contribution to the overall lighting that is predominantly from the  
skylight. In this case you can use the glow material for your lights  
(with a small radius, see the docs) to affect a visual context as you  
are looking for without exacting a huge penalty on the render time.

Yep, the glow is the material you want for this. I have used it  
infrequently but I believe this is exactly what you need to get these  
renderings looking good and completing in reasonable timeframes.

Hey Andrew,

Thank you for your help. I actually tried that after posting the message yesterday and it worked well. I got daylight factor equal to zero and a nice picture. 

I am hoping to illustrate DF=0 with a black color instead of purple. Can I change the puple color (DF=0) to black and how can this be done?

Best regards

Re: [Radiance-general] DF for a polygon
Yes, your errors are most likely resulting from deleting some of rtrace points. ?Rtrace is expecting 4351*3000 points and is getting fewer, hence the unexpected end of file error.



From the rtrace manual page: ?If the direction vector is (0,0,0), a bogus record is printed...? ??Instead of deleting you could change the vector to ?0 0 0? and then the area outside of your polygon would be comprised of bogus records (zeros). ??This method might not work if you are expecting legitimate zeros in your output.

Dear users,



I am calculating DF for a polygon. My approach for this is to use cnt, rcalc and rtrace as described below.



cnt 3000 4351 | rcalc -e 'x=157-$1*0.01; y=168.41-$2*0.01; z=0.85; $1=x; $2=y; $3=z; $4=0; $5=0; $6=1' > grids/grid_level_0.xyz



I then deleted the lines outside my polygon and initiated rtrace.



cat grids/grid_level_0.xyz | rtrace -I -ab 4 -aa 0.05 -ar 128 -ad 512 -as 256 -x 4351 -y 3000 -af ambfiles/df.amb -fac octrees/LSE_DF.oct > images/grid2illum_level_0.pic



which results the following error:



rtrace: fatal - unexpected EOF on input

pfilt: truncated input (y=754)

images/grid2illum_level_0_resized.pic: read error

<stdin>: read error (y==139)



Two of the errors occur when I start to work with the grid2illum_level_0..pic image. If I do not specify the picture size in the rtrace command I get the following error:



pfilt: bad picture size

images/grid2illum_level_0_resized.pic: bad picture size

images/grid2illum_level_0_resized_df.pic: bad picture size



Does this error occur because i delete points in the plane and how do I get around this this?

Hi Per,

It's a bit non-standard, but you make a duplicate copy of the  
falsecolor script and customize the new one by altering some lines in  
there relating to the color scale.  Change the line:

	def_redp(i):select(i,0.18848,0.05468174,
to:
	def_redp(i):select(i,0,0.05468174,

Similarly, change:

	def_grnp(i):select(i,0.0009766,2.35501e-05,
to:
	def_grnp(i):select(i,0,2.35501e-05,

and:

	def_blup(i):select(i,0.2666,0.3638662,0.4770437,
to:
	def_blup(i):select(i,0,0.3638662,0.4770437,

I'm thinking this should make the darkest values come out black.

Best,
-Greg

Hi Paul,

Another tip:

If you are planning to simulate several sky conditions and times, you should
consider separating the electric light and daylight into two simulations.
Once you have a single rendering of the electric lighting and multiple
renderings of the daylight scenarios you can add the electric light
rendering to each daylight rendering using pcomb.  This saves the time of
rendering electric lighting with every daylight condition.

Also, since you are less concerned about the accuracy of the electric
lighting you might consider adjusting the -dt parameter.  If I remember
correctly the most computationally expensive part is the shadow testing.
Increasing -dt reduces the number of shadow tests performed and should speed
up the simulation significantly.

Hi Greg,

A falsecolor scale that colors zero as black is actually very useful.  I
often use pcompos and image masks to achieve the same effect.  A second
version of falsecolor modified as you suggested is a major convenience for
me.  Thanks!

If others agree that it is useful, maybe it can be incorporated in
falsecolor as an alternate color scale (similar to the -spec option)?

Thanks,
Andy

Chien,

IES's Virtual Environment is a software suite for MEP / Building Services
engineers. It offers things like energy modeling, thermal load analysis,
CFD, and analysis tools of that sort. One of the modules is called
RadianceIES, which translates the model in VE to Radiance geometry and calls
Desktop Radiance.

You can set most of the switches, pick sky types, apply materials, set
patterns on the materials, set camera views, and add luminaires.

More information is here:
http://www.radiance-online.org/radiance-workshop5/2006_Radiance_Workshop/Presentations/DonStearn.pdf

Honestly, if you know what you're doing, there aren't many things you can't
do with it that you would be able to do interfacing with Radiance directly,
but I'll try to hit a few:

VE is set up as a walled garden, performing the tasks for you in the
background. This can be troublesome if something goes wrong, and you're
trying to retrace where the problem is. Also along these lines, they don't
allow for scripting within VE, nor an API to script from the outside, so you
can't do fancier things like multiple iterations of geometry, data
manipulation, or things of that nature. Another thing is that the models are
catered toward the thermal modeling, so they are mostly massing geometry.
For more complex geometry, you either have to have generated it separately
(an external RAD file) or brought the model through something like Sketchup,
in which case I'd recommend su2rad instead. As I recall, sensor points are
limited to one per room, so you cannot generate a grid of values.

Personally, I'm not a fan of the intensely hierarchical nature of VE, there
are some settings which are 5, 6, 7 windows deep, but I gather you're used
to this through the thermal/energy modeling bits of the software. All that
said, version 6 is being released in a month or so, maybe there will be a
different song to be sung then.

Hi all-



I?m being asked increasingly to perform more daylighting and artificial
daylight studies.  I typically use IES Virtual Environment as the interface
for Radiance, and I find I like it a fair amount, in terms of ease-of-use.
Since this is where I started using Radiance, I?m wondering if anyone has
any insights into what IES Virtual Environment can/cannot do when compared
to scripting from scratch.  Anyone offering insight here would be greatly
appreciated.

Hi Andy,

The trouble with such a scale is that it isn't compatible with the - 
cl and -cb options, since the lines disappear near the bottom end of  
the scale.  That's why I decided against it in the first place.

Cheers,
-Greg

Hi Rob, Andy,

Thank you both for you suggestions. I've been concentrating on getting the
glow material to properly work first.

I've looked at the Radiance reference manual and read the description of
glow. In my rad file I've made a new glow material:

*void glow* glowsurface
0
0
4 0.898 0.898 0.898 50

and I've changed the name of the polygon that I want to glow from it's
original surface name of 'plaster_insulated' to the name specified above
i.e. 'glowsurface'. However in my image the surface appears to be black and
I've tried changing the maxrad variable but this hasn't had an effect. I've
read what it says about maxrad but I'm still unsure of what it is
exactly and what the variable range is (is it a 0-1?) and what a typical
value is.
Could you please help?

Regards,

Paul.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Infrared scene simulation
Message-ID: <535501632@web.de>

Hi All,

I'm currently trying to find a way to simulate the radiant power distribution for a given scene in the far infrared (about 8-14um wavelength). Using the search option I saw that there already was a discussion on this subject, but I can only find fragments of it - so please forgive me if I ask questions already answered ;).

So my question is: How can I model a blackbody source at about 300?K as radiation source?

I tried using blackbody.cal and and xyz_rgb.cal as I saw in another posting:

echo 300 100 | rcalc -f blackbody.cal -f xyz_rgb.cal -e 'xi=cct_x($1);yi=cct_y($1)' -Yi=$2;Xi=Yi*yi/xi;Zi=Yi*(1-xi-yi)/yi' -e '$1=R ( Xi,Yi,Zi ) ; $2=G ( Xi,Yi,Zi ) ; $3=B ( Xi,Yi,Zi ) '

and it results in 

18.3632205      143.92786       0

So I modeled the blackbody as polygon light source with this RGB values and it's real physical extent.

First of all I must admit I don't understand the YL lightning parameter (100 in this case). Shouldn't this already be clear by giving the temperature of the blackbody?

And are these values correct for the infrared radiation the blackbody emits at such low temperatures? Or do I still have to define the spectral range I'm interested in somehow?

It would be great if someone has already experience with thie and could give me some tips.

Thenks in advance and best regards

Alex

Cool, all these years I never noticed that option to xform. The cool thing
about Radiance is you never will know everything about it.

What we really need is some kind of program to re-orient normals based on
some point. I thought I had an old AutoLISP routine that did that, but
man, that is long since gone from my backups (both the DVD kind and the
grey matter kind)!

It's hard to tell from your description if you are or not. Think of it
this way: let's say you are drawing a polygon that represents the face
(screen)  of the computer monitor you are now staring at. If you draw the
points in a clockwise fashion, the surface normal will be pointing away
from you (out the back of the monitor). If you define it with points in a
COUNTER-clockwise fashion, the polygon's surface normal will be pointing
at you. IOW, in the first example, with a glow applied, the monitor face
would render black. In the latter example, the monitor face would glow.

This can be reinforced by a permutation of the so-called "right hand
rule". Take your right hand and point at your face with your thumb, and
then curve your fingers around the axis defined by your thumb; if you
imagine your fingers pointing in the direction of rotation (and direction
of point creation), your thumb describes the surface normal (vector).

Ack, yes you are absolutely correct! I knew I should have gone and 
actually checked.... Another way to consider this, if you are working in 
the XY plane (Autocad based example here) then counter clockwise gets 
you a normal point in positive Z.

Of course this really applies to surface generated geometry. Solid 
modeling will bring its own set of issues with geometry management....

Hi Jack,

Thanks for that tip, it seems to work. Reversing the normals was very easy,
I use Ecotect as the CAD interface to radiance and it was just a case of
selecting the object and hitting 'cntrl R'.

I'll be running the simulation over the weekend with the new glow surfaces
in replacement of the lights to see how much quicker it is.

As for you suggestions about ab, dj and ds parameters, I'll give them a try
separately once I have the glow sorted.

Thanks again,

Regards,

Paul.

Dear Radiance Community,
I'm trying to compare measurements done in an artificial sky with 
radiance simulations. The problem I'm currently facing is how to model a 
lamp with a diameter of 70 centimeter that produces 20000 lux with an 
aperture of 1.5? (nearly parallel light) in Radiance?

Will be the only possibility to measure the existing lamp in a 
photogoniometer and use the ies format data files? Or are there other 
and maybe easier ways to simulate such an artificial sun lamp in 
Radiance? Some quick and dirty way would be nice!

Kind regards,
Kai

Hi Alex,

Unless you are concerned about how the surfaces look to a human  
observer, there's little sense in modeling a 300K blackbody as a  
color.  You are better off treating total radiance, using identical  
RGB intensities and reflectances throughout, and just considering the  
energy transfer.

The main problem with Radiance as an IR engine is that it doesn't  
consider the ambient temperature and radiation of all surfaces --  
only light sources and reflections thereof.  Some people have fudged  
this by considering a surfaces absorption and re-radiation as a kind  
of diffuse reflection, but this is a poor approximation for 300K,  
which is just above room temperature.  It only works when there is  
one high-temperature surface acting as a heat source.

Bottom line:  I don't think Radiance is well-suited to your problem.

Best,
-Greg

P.S.  The cct_x(t) and cct_y(t) functions in blackbody.cal are also  
not reliable for such low temperatures -- it's meant for visible  
blackbodies.  300K is in the far infrared.

Could you use a mix material of glow and reflective materials to
simulate radiation of other surfaces?

It would still be ignoring convection and conduction though.

The main problem with Radiance as an IR engine is that it doesn't
consider the ambient temperature and radiation of all surfaces -- only
light sources and reflections thereof.

You could mix a glow with a reflective material, and others have done  
so.  I don't hold out much hope of useful results at or about room  
temperature, though.  There are just too many things other than  
radiative transfer going on, as you note.

Hi Greg,

first of all thank you for your answer. 

I'm aware that modelling infrared radiation as a visible color doesn't make sense in that way. I just wasn't able do figure out how to create a source with the corresponding energy. In my application there would be on esource - a blackbody - at several degrees above roomtemperatur. I want to know the amount of energy which arrives at a certain area within the scene also regarding the energy emerging from other object in "sight" of the detector area.

I thought it might be possible to model the surfaces of these other objects as radiation sources as well, according to their temperature (which will be about 20?C) and emessivities/reflectances in the far infrared. When searching for a solution I appeared to me that radiance was the most promissing tool - but if you say it's not possible I fear I will have to search on.

Maybe you know a better alternative?

Thanks,
Alex

Hi Kai,

Is the 20,000 lux measured at the source or at the receiving surface?

You are best off using the "source" type with a 1.5-degree solid  
angle, even though your source is not infinitely distant.  Do you  
care very much about the fall-off at the edges of your model?  You  
could create an aperture that passes the infinitely distant source --  
essentially a large opaque ring with a 70 cm hole in the appropriate  
place.  Does the behavior of the light source have to precisely  
match, or is an approximation such as this good enough?

Does this make sense?

Sorry, Alex -- it's not really my area of expertise.

Anyone else care to suggest something?

Hi Greg,
thanks a lot for answer. That's exactly the solution I was looking for. 
I don't care to much about the fall-off at the edges of my model. This 
approximation meets all my expectations.

Kind regards,
Kai
