Subject: [Radiance-general] Desktop Radiance installation
Message-ID: <756077.84464.qm@web113115.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Dear All,

I am a new user of Radiance. For getting a daylighting output, I usually prepare a model in Ecotect and? export it to radiance, which gives me? the randered image. I realized that ,If I could?install Desktop Radiance from the website than total process could be shorter and could give me more realistic simulation output.?For installing Desktop Radiance, I require AutoCAD R14 or 2002 version. I have the latar version of AutoCAD , but dont have earlier version. Can anyone?give me a clue?for getting that AutoCAD R14 or how can I install Desktop Radiance .
?
Thanks for your help.

Mah??

Dear Mahbub,

first of all, it is a bit rude to copy an email that is supposed to be 
distributed by a mailing list to all the subscribers of the list as a 
private email. It is easy to figure out that this means that any of 
these subscribers get your email twice, which does not add on to the 
information in it but to some demotivation to reply.

Still, to give you a start, as far as I know Desktop Radiance is an old 
software that has not been maintained for a while. On this list, you 
will most probably not find anyone using it. So I would strongly 
recommend against using Desktop Radiance. If you decide still to do so, 
and if you are aware of the limitations and probably bugs in that old 
code, please mind that this is not a list supporting Desktop Radiance. 
Basically it means that you are on your own then. If you want to use 
Radiance, get the latest version (which is 4.0, but 3.9 is coming with 
lots of distributions and fine to use), read the documentation and ask 
when there are open questions.

Regards

Lars O. Grobe.

Greetings all,

I'm trying to use 'pvalue' to calculate a pixel value at a specific  
x,y location in an image by piping  'pvalue' through 'rcalc',  and am  
stuck on the correct syntax to use for the expression, '-e', in 'rcalc':

pvalue -o -h  -H  rendered_image.hdr | rcalc -e  
'(x_location,y_location)'

Has anyone tackled this in the past?

As always, thanks!

Chris

My apologies for not being more specific when posting earlier.   I  
also just realized that I missed a similar post in the archives from  
May 2008.  However, the latter posts don't quite answer the question  
at hand.

I have a series of images produced from a script in which the previous  
image octree is over written prior to the proceeding rpict call.   
Given the latter condition, I don't think  vwrays connected to rtrace  
will work as I don't have the corresponding 'octree' file.
I suppose I could write a Python Script to parse the pixel location  
and its associated value, but that seems a bit over kill for what  
seems should be a straight forward, one line task.

Subject: [Radiance-general] vignetting correction on a fish-eye image
Message-ID: <715312c108d6af125ff10df12de723e0.squirrel@calmail.berkeley.edu>

Dear list,

I am trying to implement a vignetting correction on a fish-eye image
taken with a rather inexpensive lens (Opteka 0.20 for Canon A570).

This is for a Post Occupancy Evaluation of an open plan workspace
using HDR at a number of workstations (n = ~15), paired with subjective
measures. (Thus the inexpensive camera + lens).

I am using Mehlika Inanici and Jim Galvin's method to derive a
polynomial from experimentation
to characterize the vignetting effect of my camera+lens at a given f-stop.

(EVALUATION OF HIGH DYNAMIC RANGE PHOTOGRAPHY
AS A LUMINANCE MAPPING TECHNIQUE, 2004)

"The vignetting effect is calculated as a polynomial function as
follows (x corresponds the pixel location):"
y = -1.28E -12 * x 4 + 3.43E - 09 * x3 - 3.38E - 06 * x2 +1.45E - 03 *
x + 7.70E - 01

Assuming the function that i derive is similar to the one above:

***I am curious how to develop a Radiance-based post-process from
this polynomial function to arrive at a script that will take a HDR
image and apply a vignette correction.


Below is Greg's implementation, but i am confused as to where to
apply/insert the polynomial function. (Or if an entirely different method is
being used here, since to me this is pretty cryptic).

#####################################################
# From NY Times acquisition cart (Sigma lens)

       pcomb -e 'sq(x):x*x' -e \
'SigmaVig5_6(deg) : 0.97 + (0.5 + atan(0.1*deg - 4)/PI)*(0.38 -
0.0134*deg)' \
               -e 'xne = x/xmax - .5; yne = y/ymax - .5' \
               -e "deg_cent = 90*sqrt(sq(2/$vfrac*xne) + sq(2/$vfrac*yne))" \
               -e 'corr = if(deg_cent-95, 0, 1.0/SigmaVig5_6(deg_cent))' \
               -e 'ro=corr*ri(1);go=corr*gi(1);bo=corr*bi(1)' \
               -o $hdrf \
               | pcompos -x $new_res[1] -y $new_res[2] \=00 - \
                       `ev "floor($new_res[1]/2)" "floor($new_res[2]/2)"` \
               > /tmp/corr$$.hdr


#####################################################

I would appreciate any guidance that anyone may have!

One suggestion that I have received is to create a "filter" image with
the same resolution as my uncorrected image. The filter image will have
numbers 1 in the middle (meaning no vignetting) and the numbers drop
towards the periphery as measured and recorded.

Then I would use pcomb to divide the original image with the "filter"
to correct for the light loss.

Any suggestions (sample code!) to create this filter image in Radiance
from the above polynomial
function would also be appreciated!

best,

Hi Chris,

If you haven't passed the picture through pfilt or otherwise  
introduced an exposure change, then it would be much faster to use  
pcompos to extract the value you're interested in.  E.g.:

	pcompos -x 1 -y 1 rendered_image.hdr -Xpos -Ypos | pvalue -h -H -d

If getinfo shows one or more EXPOSURE= lines in the header, then the  
above won't quite work and you'll need to use pvalue.  The syntax for  
the command you want is:

	pvalue -o -h -H rendered_image.hdr | rcalc -e 'eq(a,b):if(a-b+.5,b-a+. 
5,-1);and(a,b):if(a,b,a)' \
		-e 'cond=and(eq($1,x_location),eq($2,y_location))' -e '$1=$3;$2= 
$4;$3=$5'

Nasty, eh?  It's also slow.  Use pcompos if you can.  A faster  
alternative to the above is to use sed:

	pvalue -o -h -H rendered_image.hdr | sed -n 's/^ *x_location   
*y_location //p'

Cheers,
-Greg

All you have to do is to multiply your pixel values by your f(x) with x 
being the radius to the center. This can be done just using pcomb. Make 
sure to include the -o switch to eliminate any display settings 
(exposure etc).

Be aware that "center" is the optical axis and not necessarily the 
center of the sensor, so you must find out the pixel position of it.

Cheers

Lars.

Chris.

I assume you want to extract a single Lux value from an image.

My first idea would be to use pcompos to reduce the image size to a
1x1 image and then have pvalue convert that to R,G,B:

pcompos -x 1 -y 1 image.hdr -xpos -ypos | pvalue -o -d -h -H

-xpos and -ypos are the negative offset of the pixel you want to
calculate. So if you want to know the value at (321,123) it would be

pcompos -x 1 -y 1 image.hdr -321 -123 | pvalue -o -d -h -H

You have to experiment with the offset. You might have to add or
substract  1 to get exactly the pixel you want.

The you just use the standard conversion of  R,G,B to Lux with rcalc:

pcompos -x 1 -y 1 image.hdr -xpos -ypos | pvalue -o -d -h -H | rcalc
-e '$1=($1*0.265+$2*0.67+$3*0.065)*179'

Thomas

Dear all, 

 

I would like to understand how ra_tiff and pcond work.

I'm using pcond specifying contrast (-d) and max luminance (-u) of my
display. Then I transform my picture (.pic) with ra_tiff to obtain a tiff
picture.

Does somebody know which function is applied in ra_tiff to transform a .pic
in a .tif ? It seems that my picture in .tif has a mean luminance greater
than my .pic

 

Thank you in advance for your help,

 

Coralie

The pcond command does not maintain the original values of the image,
but rather adjusts them according to a visual interpretation of what the
image should look like when printed or displayed on the screen. If you
need to do exposure adjustment but preserve original data try pfilt.

Since you mention it ...

I have been playing around with a Python script that reimplements
falsecolor. On it's own it can be used as a falsecolor substitute. But
the real fun starts when you add a GUI to view images and change the
parameters interactively.

I have put up a quick web site where you can download the current
work-in-progress:

http://sites.google.com/site/tbleicher/radiance/wxfalsecolor

It doesn't do conversion to TIF yet, but BMP and PPM are supported and
should be available on Windows machines. The script needs the ra_XXX
binaries to be installed (so far).

If you need something more mature you could try RadDisplay:

Are you familiar with Cygwin?  You can run Radiance under Cygwin (inside of Windows).  Then you have access to the full version of Radiance.

I am trying to use trusted forwarded forwarding on ssh (ssh -Y user@host) to
run Radiance on a remote system and am getting segmentation fault errors. I
can look at images with ximage, and can look at certain octrees in rvu, but
the office model (ray/obj/office) crashes with the seg fault. If I load the
octree with no view, I get the rvu window, but if I load the standard view
that's in the Makefile it crashes. I initially used the Intel compiler and
some aggressive optimizations, but I recompiled with gcc and -O2 and still
have the same issue.

Has anyone else seen this?

Dear all,

I am just looking the rtcontrib -c option in the hope that it might be 
useful for reducing the graininess in images or noise in readings.

Where I am stuck is this: How do I get reinhart.cal to produce
those multiple rays which rtcontrib -c would then sum up?

This is for sensor illuminance readings:

$ cat data/2photocells.pts |rtcontrib -h -I $opt -e MF:1 \
-f reinhart.cal -b rbin -bn Nrbins \
-o tmp/sensors/s%03d.dat -c 10 \
-m sky_glow -w testroom_whitesky1.oct
rtcontrib: warning - partial accumulation in final record

Is the idea to create those multiple sample rays in a pre-run with 
rtrace or rcalc, and feed them to rtcontrib instead of the .pts file?

Thanks

Axel

Hi Axel,

The only time i've used the -c option used is in genklemsamp | rtcontrib for sampling window input directions.  The -c for genklemsamp option determines the number of rays produced per klems division.  And the -c option in rtcontrib tells how many rays to accumulate and average per output record.

In your case, you want to accumulate more values per pixel to achieve a smoother result.  There may be a way to create a tricked out vwrays/rtcontrib combo to do this.  for example:

 vwrays ... | awk '{for (i=0,i<100,i++) print $0}'  | rtcontrib -c 100 ...  (completely untested!)

Alternatively you could run your rtcontrib command several times producing several sets of bin renderings.  And then use pcomb to average the results of corresponding bin renderings into a hopefully less grainy bin rendering.

However you could probably reduce the graininess of your images by spawning more rays AND decreasing the threshold at which rays are considered insignificant and aborted.  The second part of that is often overlooked and I find vitally important for pleasing results with rtcontrib.  Increasing -ad helps to a point, but if you don't decrease -lw then increasing -ad  doesn't increase the number of rays actually traced.

I have a rules of thumb for setting -lw:
- to trace every ray spawned, -lw should be roughly 1/(ad^ab)  - watch out, every ray may be too much!
- if you have settings that produce a nice result with rpict try dividing -lw by the number of sky divisions for rtcontrib.

I seen significant grainniness improvements by reducing -lw. 

Andy

Thanks for that. It's interesting that you set -lw to 1/ad^ab, not just 
1/ad. Will try this out. I also feel that the number of sky divisions 
should have an impact on -ad (especially for sunny skies), but I can't 
quite put my finger on it.

Using -lw set to 1/(ad^ab) can be a bit extreme, but as I said you  
should set -lw no higher than 1/ad.  The smaller the value, the less  
noisy your indirect result, but a bit of experimentation on time/ 
quality trade-off is (as always) a good idea.

Cheers,

Radiance simulation but do not see the usual CSV and XML results files
Window 6 outputs for glazing with blinds/shades.

Dear Taylor,

 

In Daysim under the Building Tab you select under Shading Device either
'static shading device (included in geometry)' or your pick one of the
two dynamic blind option. The first case is equivalent to 'no blinds'.

There are currently two blind models in Daysim:

Simple (quick and dirty): Just assumes that when the blinds are down
they are down for all openings in a building and block all direct
sunlight and 75% of diffuse daylight.

Advanced (takes time to calculate): The user has to provide one or more
additional Radiance files with an explicit blind model (individual
slats) in it. Two or more sets of daylight coefficients are then being
explicitly calculated with the base scene geometry plus the various
blind settings.

Hmmm getting curious now - how is the dynamic blinds model  
implemented? Is it adding geometry or is it modifying the  
transmissivity?

Ramana - 

In Preferences, under Optical Calcs you can check the "use matrix method for
specular systems (glazing systems without shading devices)" and the program
will generate the XML and CSV files when you calculate a glazing system. I'm
not sure they will have the information you are looking for, but that is how
you get those files for a specular glazing system.

Hello all,

Is it possible to output a BSDF using Window 6, for a glazing without any
blinds/shades? I'm trying to do that for a Viracon glazing for use in
Radiance simulation but do not see the usual CSV and XML results files
Window 6 outputs for glazing with blinds/shades.

Thanks,

Hi all,

I am using gensky to know the sunvector.

gensky  10  13  10:27CET  +s  -a 57.01305  -o  -9.988333 
does the time format used in the gensky command  includes seconds also e.g i want to know the sun vector at 10:27:30 hrs ?
Best Regards,

Hi Brajesh,

Gensky doesn't take HH:MM:SS format, but you can specify any number of  
digits using the alternative decimal hours.  I.e., 10:27:30 translates  
to:

	10 + 27/60 + 30/3600 => 10.458333

% gensky 10 13 10.458333 +s -a 57.01305 -o -9.988333

Be aware that gensky doesn't have the more sophisticated orbital  
corrections, etc. that would permit it to predict the solar position  
with this kind of accuracy.

Best,
-Greg

% gensky 10 13 10.458333 +s -a 57.01305 -o -9.988333


is mentioning of CET  timezone not required or i use meridian info ? I have previously generated required data using CET

% gensky 10 13 10.458333CET +s -a 57.01305 -o -9.988333 is it correct?

Brajesh,

If you want more accurate sun vectors, I would suggest trying out 
the libnova package:

http://libnova.sourceforge.net/

It's pretty easy to build, and comes with some example code that 
will help you build a lightweight sun vector program quickly.

I use libnova to compute sun, moon, and star placements for a 
Radiance tool that I made called "genutahsky" (which works very 
much like gensky, but creates a more thorough, colorful, but 
less-flexible sky description). More on that tool here:

Hello all:

If ab (ambient bounces) =3, after a ray reaches three times of diffuse
bounces and does not hit any lighting source, then how should Radiance
define the value of this ray, for example, radiance or irradiance, in order
to calculate the radiance at the viewpoint using backward ray tracing?   I
read chapters about calculation methods in the book, Rendering with
radiance, but still a little confused.

Thank you in advance.

In simple terms, if any of the three surfaces that the ray has hit have
a direct source shining onto it, the ray will pick up the direct light
reflected from those surfaces.

 

Otherwise, I can see why you would think a very small light source with
little probability of ray intersection would rarely contribute to the
ambient calculation.

Jia.

If the number of bounces is exceeded without hitting a source or
infinity the value specified with "-av" (ambient value) is used. The
default value is "0 0 0" so you won't get any artificial contribution.

You can use rvu to read the average value of a scene on the screen.
This gives you a first approximation of -av.

Thomas

Thank you very much, Christopher and Thomas.

If I specify the value of "-av", does that mean the ray without hitting a
source will get some values (or contribution) that is related to "av". In
other words, "av" makes ray without hitting a source have some
contributions?

Sorry, I just want to clarify my question.

For the methods used in Radiance, there are three parts to calculate: direct
component, specular indirect component, and diffuse indirect component.

For the direct and specular components, the value of contribution is got by
hitting the source, is there any limit for the number of bounces for these
two component?

 But for diffuse component, how can we define the value after the number of
bounces (the value of "ab" ) is exceeded since the diffuse
component considers those without hitting any source? The rays hitting the
source will be discarded because the other components have considered them.

Thank you,
jia

Yes. That's the idea.

-av is just a way to recover the ambient light that would be lost due
to a limit on ambient bounces. To understand how -av influences the
results you can run a test scene once with a high '-ab' (say 6 or 7)
and '-av 0 0 0' and then reduce the '-ab' to 2 or 3 and increase the
-av value. When the two results are more or less the same you have
picked the right -av.

In addition, the "compamb" script will automatically compute the best
ambient value (-av) for a scene based on a rad control (.rif) file and list
of views within it. The script then appends this value in a "render =" line
in the .rif file. (can do color weighted -avs or greyscale, and can also add
an exposure value if you like).

I got it, thank you.

"ab" value is the maximum number of bounces for diffuse indirect component.
Another question is that whether there is a limit on the bounces of specular
indirect (not diffuse indirect). I do not find such options in "rtrace".

Subject: [Radiance-general] advice for material modeling
Message-ID: <4BCDF70F.8060506@lightfoundryllc.com>

Hi Everyone,
   I am trying to model reddish "sandstone" as well as a brick called 
"Navajo Gold."  The red sandstone has uneven, broken "layers" with 
little bumps on its surface.  The Navajo Gold brick varies in color, has 
tiny holes pocketing its surface, and also may not be flat.
   Here is a link to an image of the sandstone:

http://www.lightfoundryllc.com/materials/sandstone.jpg

   And a few links to images of the Navajo gold:

http://www.lightfoundryllc.com/materials/ng0.jpg
http://www.lightfoundryllc.com/materials/ng1.jpg
http://www.lightfoundryllc.com/materials/ng2.jpg
http://www.lightfoundryllc.com/materials/ng3.jpg
http://www.lightfoundryllc.com/materials/ngside.jpg

  Unfortunately I do not have direct access to the materials, but 
someone has measured their general reflectance values.
   I would like to create a high quality rendering of an interior curved 
wall made with red sandstone.  We are designing skylights for accenting 
this wall for people outside to see (they would look through a glass 
curtain wall to see it).  Ideally we would like to see little shadows on 
the surface of the red sandstone due to its uneven layering and some 
other effects due to its texture.
   It would also be nice to have a good rendering of the Navajo Gold 
brick walls, but this is less of a priority.
   Can anyone give any advice for how to model the pattern/textures/etc. 
for this or have pointers to success stories for these types of materials?
   Thanks!

- Dan

In general that is correct. The devil, as always, is in the detail.

So far I found out:

1) on Windows use double quotes (") to quote a -e expression

2) in Python don't quote at all but pass the expression as a single
argument to subprocess.Popen(). Example:

  from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
  args = ["pcomb", "-e",
"ro=if(ri(1),ri(1),ri(2));go=if(gi(1),gi(1),gi(2));bo=if(bi(1),bi(1),bi(2));",
"-", "img2.hdr"]
  p = Popen(args, stdin=PIPE, stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE)
  comb_data, err = p.communicate(img1_data)

3) if you use a file for the expression, add a newline at the end


BTW: I will release a Python version of falsecolor2 any day now, plus
a wx GUI frontend.

Well, then, would you like some help? Because I was just starting on 
one and there's no point in duplicating your efforts.

I've got a short writeup on command line argument processing, but it is 
rather technical, and I think I will put it up on the developer's list 
instead.

Meantime, Greg, how would you feel about adding:

to the "falsecolor" man page? It would have helped me, anyway.

Message-ID: <t2h89355c0f1004201520m8fa35625h108bb358e9e909cb@mail.gmail.com>

All.

I have uploaded a binary package of wxfalsecolor, a Python based HDR
image viewer and graphical frontend to falsecolor2.

You can download the binary for Windows here:

http://pyrat.googlecode.com/files/wxfalsecolor.exe

There are no Mac or Linux binaries yet and I'm not sure if there ever
will be. It much simpler to use the source files on these platforms
directly. A Radiance installation is required (pcomb, pvalue, ra_bmp
etc).


I had no time to write documentation yet but I think it's use is
intuitive enough. The *.exe file allows drag and drop on the
executable and once the app is open on the image area. Once you have
opened an image you can convert it to a falsecolor image and save the
result as *.bmp.

You can also display the values of the pixel under the cursor. Check
the "show values" checkbox and the image data will be read and
converted (this can take some seconds). RGB and Lux values (only for
-i images) are shown in the status bar when you move the cursor over
the image.

Enjoy.

Thomas

Hi Thomas,

Very nice tool and easy to use! I think Radiance users in windows will be
very happy with this tool!

Just one thing to check.
When I start program before main window is opened, I got an error:
"The procedure entry point EtwTraceMessage couldnt no be located in the
dynamic link library ntdll.dll"

When I close error message, program is opened it seems that all features are
working without problems.

I'm using Windows XP Professional.

Thanks again for such a useful tool,
Marija

Hi Marija.

Thanks for the feedback. I just tried the package on my work PC and I
saw the same message. I think it's because I build on Windows 7 and
the ntdll.dll files are slightly different. I never saw it on my test
machine at home, though.

If you think it's worth doing it. I myself wouldn't advertise the
scripts as Python packages because the depend so heavily on Radiance.

BTW: Did you try the app already? I just got a report of a
warning/error message popping up on Windows XP. I haven't seen it at
home but here at work I can reproduce the message. I wonder if you had
seen it, too.

About further development:

I'm happy with what I have now. I only needed an image viewer that
wouldn't exceed the size of my screen like ximage does. The falsecolor
features where a nice add on I wanted to use to check my future
improvements on the falsecolor2 script.

I thought about restructuring the code to allow multiple images being
presented at the same time which would then allow us to perform some
image manipulations on them via pcomb (difference, relative
difference, blend, mask etc). However, when I need to do this now I'm
happy to do it on the command line. So it will probably not happen
soon unless there is a demand for these features.

I keep a TODO list in the source code tree:

http://code.google.com/p/pyrat/source/browse/trunk/wxfalsecolor/TODO

I forgot to add "support for more image formats via PIL". I think that
covers my ideas for an image viewer.

I started the pyrat project on code.google.com because I have more
ideas for small tools that might be useful for others (especially on
Windows) and a few older Python scripts which might be resurrected in
the context.


1) rad2 / wxrad2

A new (graphical) rif file processor. I already had written parts of
rad in Python for my old Blender exporter. It's basically there to
avoid the need for a command line. You should be able to explore the
dependency tree, the individual calculation steps and progress of
running jobs. There are a couple of advanced calculation methods out
there (like stencil) that could be easily supported by a frontend like
this. Similar to trad and Ecotect's Radiance Control Panel.


2) render daemon

A small app that sits in your task bar and watches your running and
incoming *.rif or makefile-type render jobs. Could also have a network
component which offloads the work to a render server or farm. I need
something like this as a starting point for scenes exported from
Sketchup.


3) Python bindings for HDR images

falsecolor2 uses the subprocess module and pvalue to read image data.
That takes a long time and is needlessly complicated. I would like to
try to compile the few methods necessary as C Python extensions. After
that the functionality of pcompos, pcomb and other p* apps could be
reimplemented in pure Python (or those could be made Python extensions
as well).


4) couple of scripts to create plots and PDF reports from grids


If your interested in any of this you're most welcome to join the project.


Cheers,
Thomas

Subject: [Radiance-general] two sided surface
Message-ID: <002701cae16e$0d67a970$2836fc50$@com>

I am modeling a large amount of physical blinds in an office scene. I am
replicating a Warema blind that has an opaque surface (grey) on the convex
side and a chrome surface (93% reflective) on the concave side. To minimize
the amount of geometry I was hoping there is an easy way to apply two
materials to the curved plane instead of adding a thickness and more than
double the geometry.

I have searched the knowledge database and could not find what I was looking
for. I hope there is an easy way to do this. 

For instance the surface normal is the chrome material and the opposite side
is the opaque material.

Thank you in advance.

Nick

materials to the curved plane instead of adding a thickness and more than
double the geometry.

I have searched the knowledge database and could not find what I was looking
for. I hope there is an easy way to do this. 

For instance the surface normal is the chrome material and the opposite side
is the opaque material.

Thank you in advance.

Nick.

In Radiance geometry and material definition go hand in hand. You
could try evaluating the surface normal to chose the correct material
in a custom expression but that would increase your render time
significantly.

As an alternative you could use the same geometry with a small
z-offset. If you have all the blinds in a separate *.rad file use the
-m option of xform to give them a new modifier:

!xform -m grey_mat blinds.rad
!xform -m chrome -t 0 0 -0.001 blinds.rad

That will offset the blinds by 0.001 units down and use the material
'chrome' for this 'side'.

Regards,
Thomas

Hi,

The following assumes geometry with uniform normal orientation.

void plastic concave
0
0
5 .5 .5 .5 0 0

void metal convex
0
0
5 .8 .8 .8 .8 0

void mixfunc blind
4 concave convex if(Rdot,1,0) .
0
0

Then apply the blind material to your geometry. You will need to correctly define the convex and concave materials for your needs. You will also need to check that's the materials are showing up on the correct sides. One way to do this is to first define the convex and concave materials as red and blue for an easy visual check. If you need to reverse the materials then simply swap the names in the blind material definition.

Hope this helps.

Hi Nick,

Thomas is probably right about rendering times, but for completeness,  
here is the other method for making the front side diffuse and the  
back side chrome:

void plastic diffuse_gray
0
0
5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0 0

void metal chrome
0
0
5 0.93 0.93 0.93 1 0

void mixfunc blind_mat
4 diffuse_gray chrome if(Rdot,1,0) .
0
0

# ... etc.

Hope this helps.

Thank you for the replys. I ended up trying the mixfunc route and that worked well.

So since you fixed that issue, I have one more issue that I don?t know can be resolved easily. 

 

These blinds also have 1/32?  perforated holes spaced about 1/32? apart. 

Picture: http://i23.photobucket.com/albums/b354/mrhubof/General/DSC_0103.jpg

 

I have tried  the perforate.cal mixfunc, to create this effect, but as I rotate the blinds to simulated them shut or half shut the function doesn?t work, because the blind rotates along the z axis. So what results are elongated holes when the blinds are closed.

void mixfunc Perforation_Chrome

6 Chrome void z_hole perforate.cal -s 0.00079375

0

1 0.4

If any of you have suggestions to get around this issue it would be much appreciated.

Thank you again for the help on the previous issue!

Hi Nick,

If you are interested in material performance of these blinds, I am not really sure that perforate.cal is what you want use. How are you transforming the geometry of the blinds to get the rotation?

Another way to do this would be to split your blind geometry in half with an opaque half that use the blind mixfunc and a translucent half built either use some combination of trans and mixfunc definitions or perhaps using a simple form of BRTDfunc to account for front and backside reflectance and material transmittance. If I recall correctly the manufacturer provides some transmittance information...

Jack,

Thank you for the suggestions. The series of blind rotations are modeled separately (so that I can easily add and subtract them for the scene) and I have also modeled a little less than half of the blind to be ready for the perforation material. 

 

We would like to match the blinds physically without using a trans material. The project we are working on requires us to match a photo of a space that uses these blinds. We not only want to match the space aesthetically but also have accurate illumination plots and luminance rendering data. 

The perorate.cal looks good when the blinds are in the horizontal (open) position, it is when we render the other angles that the perforations become stretched. I have had success in the past altering the axis that these .cal files use, but when I have the blinds angled between straight up/down and horizontal then I run into the problem.

You probably have to redefine perforate.cal to use (U,V) coordinates
instead of global (x,y)

Hi Dan,

as a general rule of thumb, you can modifiers to perturbate the surface 
(e.g. vary brightness, surface normals) as long as the average of the 
perturbation is one. In this case you would use your measured 
reflectance as a base material and apply some fancy structure-modifiers 
to it.

For the case where you want to perturbate the color, too, it will be 
more complicated. As far as I understood, you only have the average 
reflectance, but you do not know the local colors. You may try the same 
as above, ensuring that the average complies with your measured 
reflectance, and use colorpict or colorfunc to perturbate the color. But 
this may leas to strange effects.

Best would be calibrated photographs.

Cheers, Lars.

Hey Thomas,

I think there are a few other ways to accomplish this in addition to your suggestion of modifying perforate.cal to use UV coordinates. One method would be to make sure that a matching transform is applied to the material definition. Another method would be using instances for the blind elements.

Best,

-Jack

Hi Nick,

So if I understand correctly, you have blind geometry modeled at different rotations where you then turn on only the rotation that you want to render. If your blinds only run in one direction then you should be able to apply a rotation to the perforated material. If not then Thomas' suggestion of modifying perforate.cal to use UV coordinates is probably the way to go.

From an accuracy point of view I am not sure that using perforate.cal to model the holes and spacing is actually going to be accurate from the standpoint of evaluating illuminance as the holes are rather small and will be dependent on image resolution. Thus my suggestion to consider trans or BRTDfunc where measured transmittance can be applied. Perhaps others can jump in and let me know if I am missing something on this.

From the standpoint of a luminance simulation, ie a rendering, then if in your views you might actually be close enough to see the holes then using perforate.cal might be nice. But you might want to examine some photos or check out an installation to understand how much of the perforation you actually perceive.

Jack,

Thank you for the suggestions. The series of blind rotations are modeled separately (so that I can easily add and subtract them for the scene) and I have also modeled a little less than half of the blind to be ready for the perforation material. 

 

We would like to match the blinds physically without using a trans material. The project we are working on requires us to match a photo of a space that uses these blinds. We not only want to match the space aesthetically but also have accurate illumination plots and luminance rendering data. 

The perorate.cal looks good when the blinds are in the horizontal (open) position, it is when we render the other angles that the perforations become stretched. I have had success in the past altering the axis that these .cal files use, but when I have the blinds angled between straight up/down and horizontal then I run into the problem.

Nick

Hi Nick,

If you are interested in material performance of these blinds, I am not really sure that perforate.cal is what you want use. How are you transforming the geometry of the blinds to get the rotation?

Another way to do this would be to split your blind geometry in half with an opaque half that use the blind mixfunc and a translucent half built either use some combination of trans and mixfunc definitions or perhaps using a simple form of BRTDfunc to account for front and backside reflectance and material transmittance. If I recall correctly the manufacturer provides some transmittance information...

Thank you for the replys. I ended up trying the mixfunc route and that worked well.

So since you fixed that issue, I have one more issue that I don?t know can be resolved easily. 



These blinds also have 1/32?  perforated holes spaced about 1/32? apart. 

Picture: http://i23.photobucket.com/albums/b354/mrhubof/General/DSC_0103.jpg



I have tried  the perforate.cal mixfunc, to create this effect, but as I rotate the blinds to simulated them shut or half shut the function doesn?t work, because the blind rotates along the z axis. So what results are elongated holes when the blinds are closed.

void mixfunc Perforation_Chrome

6 Chrome void z_hole perforate.cal -s 0.00079375

0

1 0.4

If any of you have suggestions to get around this issue it would be much appreciated.

Thank you again for the help on the previous issue!

Nick

Hi,

The following assumes geometry with uniform normal orientation.

void plastic concave
0
0
5 .5 .5 .5 0 0

void metal convex
0
0
5 .8 .8 .8 .8 0

void mixfunc blind
4 concave convex if(Rdot,1,0) .
0
0

Then apply the blind material to your geometry. You will need to correctly define the convex and concave materials for your needs. You will also need to check that's the materials are showing up on the correct sides. One way to do this is to first define the convex and concave materials as red and blue for an easy visual check. If you need to reverse the materials then simply swap the names in the blind material definition.

Hope this helps.

I am modeling a large amount of physical blinds in an office scene. I am
replicating a Warema blind that has an opaque surface (grey) on the convex
side and a chrome surface (93% reflective) on the concave side. To minimize
the amount of geometry I was hoping there is an easy way to apply two
materials to the curved plane instead of adding a thickness and more than
double the geometry.

I have searched the knowledge database and could not find what I was looking
for. I hope there is an easy way to do this. 

For instance the surface normal is the chrome material and the opposite side
is the opaque material.

Thank you in advance.

Nick

I've been tinkering with Genklemsamp to generate a daylight matrix  
file of a window for input into Dctimestep.  I'm using a simple 15'  
x15' x 10' room with a single, south facing window and run Genklemsamp  
as follows:
$ genklemsamp -vd 0 -1 0 -vu 0 0 1 -c 20000 material.rad window.rad |  
rtcontrib -c 20000 -e MF:2 -faf -f reinhart.cal -b rbin -bn Nrbins -m  
sky_glow @render.opt  isotropic_sky.oct > window.dmx

The above seems to go through it's paces without a hitch and generates  
the expected 'window.dmx'  file.

However, when I run dctimestep using the above 'window.dmx file, a  
venetian_blind.xml file from Optics, and sky patch coefficient images  
generated with  vwrays and rtcontrib as follows:
$ gensky 9 21 12:00 -a 37.71 -o 122.21 -m 120 | genskyvec | dctimestep  
image/glass_d_c4%03d.hdr venetian_blind.xml window.dmx >   
test_9-21_1200.hdr
I get the following error:
fatal - unexpected EOF reading Window.dmx

Has anyone else run into this?

Thanks.

All,

Thanks for the help once again. After some more thought I think the perforate.cal would be great to look at, but considering rendering time (if it will even render, with as many blinds that we have to model) the better route might be the BRTD func.  I appreciate all of your help and will let you know how it works out.

Hi Chris,
You need to add -m 2 to your genskyvec command.  The -m argument in genskyvec should agree with -e MF:  setting in the rtcontrib command that creates the daylight matrix.

Hi Chris,
hmm...   can you check venetian_blind.xml to make sure that it is a full klems basis (not half or quarter). you should see something that looks like this:
<AngleBasisName>LBNL/Klems Full</AngleBasisName>

Has anyone else tried this on Mac OS? It doesn't work for me--is it 
working for anyone?

A lot of the files in the Python Package Index (PyPI) are wrappers of 
various sorts--I don't think that's a barrier.

Anyhow, next week I think I'll dig into this & see if I can find out 
why falsecolor2.py doesn't work on Mac.

Yes, here! OS X 10.6, Python 2.6 from the system.

One tip: start with -d command line option and watch the messages scroll by.

[moving this to code development]

On 10.5.8 / Python.org Python 2.5.4:
   It starts, & I can view images. If I press "convert," however, I  
get a "broken pipe" message from combineImages.

Does this work on 10.6?

Hi Dan,

I just got back in and see that I missed this so perhaps my reply is too 
late to be of use. In any event here are a few thoughts.

If you want to create "high quality" renderings then the best thing to 
do is to obtain some good photographs of these materials. I know that 
this can be a challenge as it means that you have to be much more 
demanding with the client in terms of the information that they need to 
provide, such as access to decent samples, but it can definitely be 
worth it. In my experience the best thing to do is to shoot your own 
photos of good samples and calibrate with the Macbeth Color Checker (or 
some other mechanism for calibrating reflectance and color). That way 
you have control over everything. On the other hand if you could perhaps 
get representative photos from the stone supplier then you could perhaps 
use these to develop image patterns that can be adjusted to the 
estimated reflectance information that you do have. Note though if you 
want the rough surface of the materials to cast shadows depending on how 
the light is hitting the surface (time of day perhaps), then you will 
have to use actual geometry, which is going to be a lot more complicated.

Again depending on your rendering/visualization goals and if it just is 
not possible to get good photos, another approach is to consider what is 
important to demonstrate given the possible view(s) that you will be 
showing. For stone masonry materials the first thing that I always 
consider is how much variation is there from stone to stone. My guess is 
the sandstone is supposed to have relatively low variation, whereas the 
brick seems to have quite a high degree of variation. This kind of 
variation can be accounted for procedurally with a tiling function that 
varies the brightness and/or color of the tile (stone unit). Another 
item to consider at this macro level is the relative reflectance of any 
mortar or joint condition, this again can be treated as part of a 
procedural tiling function. With these two items accounted for the next 
thing to try to approximate to some level is variation within a given 
stone unit. This is where things get a bit more challenging with the 
materials you are looking at. The sandstone can probably be approximated 
with some variation of noise functions. The brick though demonstrates 
some pretty sharp cutoffs in variation and color which I am not sure 
offhand how I would treat. Just to get the variation it might be worth 
searching for imagery online and seeing if there is something that you 
could use to get the variation.

Hope this helps.

Regards,

-Jack de Valpine

Dear Jack and Lars,
   Thank you very much for the timely modeling advice-- yes, I can see 
how calibrating the photographs can help with selecting the right color 
for the stone and brick.  Also, thanks for the tips on color variation 
strategies.
    I will let you know what I come up with for the texture.  I know its 
a cross between an art and a science in doing so (e.g. see the "forest" 
example below)-- just thought maybe someone have studied this material 
before.  On a related note, have there been discussions on having a 
material database at radiance-online/elsewhere?
   On a project where I had to quickly model how a forest would impact 
the lighting on a facade, I hacked perforate.cal instead of trying to 
model the actual trees (trunks, branches, needles, yuk).

This was the real scene:

http://www.lightfoundryllc.com/materials/forest/forest.jpg

and this was what was modeled:

http://www.lightfoundryllc.com/materials/forest/model.jpg

and the script I hacked:

http://www.lightfoundryllc.com/materials/forest/forest.cal

Given more time I would have tried to increase the density of the dot 
pattern near the ground/etc.

- Dan

Greg sent an email semi-recently about the 2010 Radiance Workshop:

"We have been discussing dates for the workshop, and so far, our
favorites are:
September 22nd-24th (Wed-Fri)

Second choice dates would be:
October 6th-8th (also Wed.-Fri.)"

Just a note to mention that the International Association of Lighting
Designers' annual conference is Oct 7-9, which makes me like the first
choice of dates better. Not sure if this has been set yet.

Hi Dan,

There have been questions and discussions on a material database. But I 
think that given the quantity and variety of materials out there this 
quickly gets out of control. Consider glazing alone with something like 
Optics5  (a complete software package!) for dealing with this class of 
materials.

Perhaps another way to consider the forest is by estimating an average 
transmittance and then just using a trans material. One could even vary 
this over some vertical dimension.

Best,

-Jack

Hi Rob,

Good timing.  Jan & I were just discussing this, and trying to settle  
on a final set of dates.  Apparently, there is a conflict with the  
original dates suggested for September, as the Bausim-Conference is  
taking place in Vienna from the 22nd to the 24th.  The October dates  
weren't good for me, either, so Jan suggested Sept. 20-22nd --  
overlapping Bausim with an optional third day (Wed.) to cover one or  
more special topics.

Anyone have any objections to a Sept. 20-22 schedule for the 2010  
workshop?

-Greg

No, not to the schedule, but out of curiousity - is there also any 
pre-announcement on the location?

I would love to finally make it to a Radiance Workshops after 
systematically (not intentionally) missing them so far, and now I am 
waiting for the good news on the location...

Cheers, Lars.

Hi Brajesh,

Usually a few months before the workshop there is a call for speakers and
the results of that will define the core content. In the past there has also
been a tutorial component to some of the workshops (last year there was an
all-day HDR imaging tutorial). I'd expect an update on cost and content
after the call for speakers goes out.

I am hoping to make it out there this year, and the new dates work for me,
so, yay.

- Rob

Yes, it seems that few people noticed the announcement asking about  
date conflicts on March 5th.  I should have reminded everyone of the  
location in my last e-mail.  Germany it is!

Thanks for your prompt reply.

I use Revit Architecture, AutoCAD, and SketchUp. The first one is my
priority. Is it possible to import from Revit?

Hi Jia,

Here are a few options:

    * revit -> fbx - then convert fbx to obj via fbx converter
    * revit -> dwg - then convert via something like Polytrans or NuGraf
    * revit -> dwg - then use torad autolisp export (this might need
      updating though to function in current autocad)
    * sketchup -> obj - via sketchup pro
    * skectup -> rad - via su2rad

Subject: [Radiance-general] trans dashboard widget
Message-ID: <BBA990A6-8BA5-4D39-8408-66C791D648C4@lbl.gov>

Hi,

I grew tired of opening finder to open my trans material excel spreadsheet, wait for excel to open every time I needed a trans material definition (really I know who has that kind of time?).  To save myself the hassle I spent a the better part of a saturday creating a dashboard widget for generating trans material descriptions on mac osx!  now I just hit F4 slide the sliders and hit the copy button and I've got it.

If you use a mac and your trans material generating workflow has got you down, give it a try: http://software.mcneilorama.com/Gen_Trans_Widget.html

Comments and suggestions are welcome.

Andy

Cool! Thanks Andy. Works great here.

Testimonial:
It was early, I had a ton of email to get through, the coffee hadn't kicked
in; on top of all that, my trans material generating workflow really had me
down! I tried Gen_Trans_Widget from Mcneilorama, and it was just the thing
for my early morning blues! Thank you, Gen_Trans_Widget! (Not available in
stores.)

Our office uses Autodesk Ecotect mostly because of its ability to handle
illumination grids, it is also well suited to export to Radiance. However it
isn't the best modeling program, so typically modeling in other programs and
importing is one of the best options.

When we bring in Revit models we import them as a .dwg.

But when we bring in a Sketchup model it is imported as a .obj.

Most architectural models have more detail than what is needed for daylight
analysis or renderings, so alter the models within their native modeling
program (Revit, Sketchup) first while thinking of how Ecotect/Radiance will
handle it. Good luck.

I have modeled the reflective blinds that we had discussed in this thread earlier, but I would like your opinion on the rendering settings. I could do a bunch of tests at low resolution but even with our 8 processor mac it still takes a while and I would get faster results asking all of you smart people out there. 

Here is an image of the blinds in an open position. 

http://i23.photobucket.com/albums/b354/mrhubof/General/genzyme_2010_04_21_c1.jpg

 

The resulting image has many reflection spots on the ceiling, which is the problem.  The ceiling is mostly just a white material. The floor is a carpet.

 

render=  -ab 8 -aa 0.08 -ar 2094 -ad 1024 -as 512

840x480 ? rendering took 7 hours

Scene size = 33

Sunny, Sep at noon in New York, windows face south.

 

The top of the blind (concave facing ceiling) is:

void metal concave

0

0

5 0.9 0.88 0.88 0.8 0.02

 

Thank you much,

Nick

All,

Thanks for the help once again. After some more thought I think the perforate.cal would be great to look at, but considering rendering time (if it will even render, with as many blinds that we have to model) the better route might be the BRTD func.  I appreciate all of your help and will let you know how it works out.

Hi Nick,

So if I understand correctly, you have blind geometry modeled at different rotations where you then turn on only the rotation that you want to render. If your blinds only run in one direction then you should be able to apply a rotation to the perforated material. If not then Thomas' suggestion of modifying perforate.cal to use UV coordinates is probably the way to go.

>From an accuracy point of view I am not sure that using perforate.cal to model the holes and spacing is actually going to be accurate from the standpoint of evaluating illuminance as the holes are rather small and will be dependent on image resolution. Thus my suggestion to consider trans or BRTDfunc where measured transmittance can be applied. Perhaps others can jump in and let me know if I am missing something on this.

>From the standpoint of a luminance simulation, ie a rendering, then if in your views you might actually be close enough to see the holes then using perforate.cal might be nice. But you might want to examine some photos or check out an installation to understand how much of the perforation you actually perceive.

Jack,

Thank you for the suggestions. The series of blind rotations are modeled separately (so that I can easily add and subtract them for the scene) and I have also modeled a little less than half of the blind to be ready for the perforation material. 



We would like to match the blinds physically without using a trans material. The project we are working on requires us to match a photo of a space that uses these blinds. We not only want to match the space aesthetically but also have accurate illumination plots and luminance rendering data. 

The perorate.cal looks good when the blinds are in the horizontal (open) position, it is when we render the other angles that the perforations become stretched. I have had success in the past altering the axis that these .cal files use, but when I have the blinds angled between straight up/down and horizontal then I run into the problem.

Hi Nick,

If you are interested in material performance of these blinds, I am not really sure that perforate.cal is what you want use. How are you transforming the geometry of the blinds to get the rotation?

Another way to do this would be to split your blind geometry in half with an opaque half that use the blind mixfunc and a translucent half built either use some combination of trans and mixfunc definitions or perhaps using a simple form of BRTDfunc to account for front and backside reflectance and material transmittance. If I recall correctly the manufacturer provides some transmittance information...

Thank you for the replys. I ended up trying the mixfunc route and that worked well.

So since you fixed that issue, I have one more issue that I don?t know can be resolved easily. 



These blinds also have 1/32?  perforated holes spaced about 1/32? apart. 

Picture: http://i23.photobucket.com/albums/b354/mrhubof/General/DSC_0103.jpg



I have tried  the perforate.cal mixfunc, to create this effect, but as I rotate the blinds to simulated them shut or half shut the function doesn?t work, because the blind rotates along the z axis. So what results are elongated holes when the blinds are closed.

void mixfunc Perforation_Chrome

6 Chrome void z_hole perforate.cal -s 0.00079375

0

1 0.4

If any of you have suggestions to get around this issue it would be much appreciated.

Thank you again for the help on the previous issue!

Nick

Hi,

The following assumes geometry with uniform normal orientation.

void plastic concave
0
0
5 .5 .5 .5 0 0

void metal convex
0
0
5 .8 .8 .8 .8 0

void mixfunc blind
4 concave convex if(Rdot,1,0) .
0
0

Then apply the blind material to your geometry. You will need to correctly define the convex and concave materials for your needs. You will also need to check that's the materials are showing up on the correct sides. One way to do this is to first define the convex and concave materials as red and blue for an easy visual check. If you need to reverse the materials then simply swap the names in the blind material definition.

Hope this helps.

I am modeling a large amount of physical blinds in an office scene. I am
replicating a Warema blind that has an opaque surface (grey) on the convex
side and a chrome surface (93% reflective) on the concave side. To minimize
the amount of geometry I was hoping there is an easy way to apply two
materials to the curved plane instead of adding a thickness and more than
double the geometry.

I have searched the knowledge database and could not find what I was looking
for. I hope there is an easy way to do this. 

For instance the surface normal is the chrome material and the opposite side
is the opaque material.

Thank you in advance.

Nick

Very cool, Andy!  Only took me a minute to install, and the stops on  
the sliders corresponding to legal values are a particularly nice touch.

One item for the wish list would be the ability to specify color  
somehow, so one doesn't have to do the luminance conversion thing.   
Something like a hue-saturation wheel would work.  Shall I send you an  
image for that?

Try adjusting the ?sj specular jittering parameter between 0 and 1. Looks like the default is ?sj 1, so you might run a test with ?sj 0.3 for comparison. I?m not sure which one would actually look better though, or if it affects accuracy.

Hi Nick,

Unfortunately, you've hit upon the one case that Radiance doesn't  
really handle properly:  curved, specular window coverings.  Your best  
hope at this point is to add some roughness to the specular side of  
your surface and use mkillum to generate an output distribution.  If  
you could measure a BTDF for the blinds and give it to mkillum that  
way, you'd be golden, but I don't expect that you have such a thing.

Eventually, we hope to create a tool that would allow you to model  
this (and other types) complex fenestration, but we're a few months  
away from having that ready.

Cheers,
-Greg

Did you notice what happens when Td & Ts are set to zero?

Hi Andy,

This was more of a struggle than I expected.  I don't know what I did  
with my old color wheel, so I tried to come up with an expression to  
generate a new one based on the Wikipedia page on HSV conversions.   
It's not quite what I was going for, but it's OK:

pcomb -x 512 -y xres \
-e 'xc:xres/2;yc:yres/2;xr=(x-xc)/xc;yr=(y-yc)/yc' \
-e 'rv=.7349*xr-.3495*yr;gv=-.2651*xr+.2279*yr;bv=-.2651*xr-.9268*yr' \
-e 'max(a,b):if(a-b,a,b);Y=1-max(rv,max(gv,bv))' \
-e 'in=1-xr*xr-yr*yr' \
-e 'ro=if(in,Y+rv,.5);go=if(in,Y+gv,.5);bo=if(in,Y+bv,.5)' \
| ra_tiff - color_wheel.tif

When the user chooses a color, you'll have to map back to linear RGB  
(undoing the 2.2 gamma) and normalize.

Hope it works!

-Greg

P.S.  I didn't notice the trick of going to "plastic" when  
transmission is zero -- very nice!

Greg,
Thank you for the reply. We figured this might be a tricky rendering to pull
off, luckily we don't absolutely need it at this point. We have the
equipment and the blind to put together a BTDF file, but not the time or
budget. If you come up with a tool that would allow us to model this please
keep us in mind.
Thanks a ton for all of the hard work you put into this software.
Nick

Hi,

you can try the photonmap here, but that would mean that you install  
the old 3.7 release. Then you would add a photonport surface , do the  
forward distribution starting from that surface, and avoid all  
indirect rendering later in Radiance.

Cheers, Lars.

Hi Jack,

Yes the inevitable question.  I actually thought about mentioning portability in my original email, but thought that it was presumptuous to think that anyone other than me might actually want it.  It is a silly tool after all, though not as silly as my original iphone app idea.

Mac widgets are html and javascript, so putting it on the web is easy in theory.   I'll see if I can get it to work on the web, and then try to find a suitable home for it.

I think windows 7 has equivalent sidebar gadgets that are also html with javascript.  Some Linux variants have a similar widget/gadget scheme.  I'd be happy to share what I have with anyone who wants to create the same for another operating system, but I don't have easy access to windows 7 or a linux box, so I can't do that myself.

Best,
Andy

Hi Greg,
Thanks, that's quite the pcomb function.  I'll see what I can do to get a color picker in the widget.  Thanks!

Hello:

First thank all of you for the replies.

I tried some ways mentioned, I am confused with some of the methods.

*(1)* When I export Revit to fbx and then use FBX converter (provided by
autodesk) to convert fbx to .obj file.  The .mtl file just contains the name
of materials without any other data such as RGB, or reflectance.

Also I tried to use: obj2rad -n objfile.obj > obj.data .    I found all the
materials in .obj file should be defined. Some of  them are as follows:

"Basic_Wall_Typ__Partition_Wall__188653_"
"Basic_Wall_Typ__Partition_Wall__188781_"
"Basic_Wall_Typ__Partition_Wall__188881_"
"Basic_Wall_Typ__Partition_Wall__188971_"
"Basic_Wall_Typ__Partition_Wall__189016_"
...... too long

Should I define so many materials? Maybe I should delete some of them if
they use the same materials.

*(2)* I am stuck with the command obj2rad. I just know some basic knowledge
of .obj file such as its basic structure, the basic command of obj file.
But  I can not follow the man page of obj2rad, such as mapping rule file.

Is that right the mapping rule file in this command contained the texture
and materials (like those in Radiance) or some images?  Should I write
up the mapping file by myself or just find from somewhere?   I have no idea
of what the mapping file is so, Could someone send me one or two
small examples of map files or others related to this command?

*(3)* When the building model is complicated, is that reliable for this
command? I mean whether it makes mistakes about the surface normals. Is
there any point that should be noted when using export Revit file to
Radiance?


*(4)* If I export .dwg, the torad autolisp (
http://www.schorsch.com/download/torad/) seems to be used for AutoCAD
R11-14. If I use Polytrans, for example, should I convert obj file? Is there
any better way?

*(5) *I do not have a SketchUp pro, so I just browsed the su2rad for free
version of SketchUp, it seems easy to understand.

Sorry for so many confusions and questions.

As always, Thank you all.

Jia

Hi Andy,

It is very easy to throw Linux on a Mac if you have vmfusion 
(www.vmware.com) or parallels 
(http://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/). From my own usage of 
vmfusion, all you need to do is download the latest Ubuntu or Kubuntu 
livecd (www.ubuntu.net - gnome desktop version or www.kubuntu.net for 
the kde desktop version). Create a new virtual appliance, and set the cd 
to point to the iso download. No need to allocate any virtual disks - 
set memory to 1024 or better and go. (Best to have 2GB of memory or 
better in the host computer or it will be very slow.)

Once running, go to the software download area and download/install 
radiance from the repository or from the terminal use 'sudo apt-get 
install radiance radiance-doc radiance-materials' to download and 
install radiance.

Alternative images with radiance pre-installed can be found at 
http://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/ Learnix for Axel Jacob's version or my 
own under the Curtin link - many thanks to Axel for hosting this for me.

By the way vmplayer - a free download for Linux and Windows, allows 
Linux and Windows to run/create virtual appliances. This is how we teach 
Radiance at Curtin on PC's running Windows XP/Pro.
