Subject: [Radiance-general] Specular Reflections with the Daylight
	Coefficient Method
Message-ID: <AANLkTim2TAFnoh3vylXbEhOkntmPYecQD0zJ_vocsABz@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I'm trying to use the daylighting coefficient method (using rtcontrib) to
get annual simulation results for a room equipped with a mirrored
daylighting system (like a light shelf, for example). Is this possible? I
know that by using the -dr option, Radiance will create virtual light
sources to account for specular reflections of direct light from the sun.
However, since the daylight coefficients are calculated using a blank sky
having a uniform luminance distribution, there is no sun for the -dr option
to find. I believe this would make the sky patch coefficients come out lower
than they should be because the specular direct reflection of the sun would
not be included, but my understanding of how the program works may not be
correct.

Can the daylight coefficient method be made to work with specular
reflections in Radiance, or is this not possible given the way the program
is implemented?

Thanks,
Kevin Thuot

Hi Kevin,

The daylight coefficient method usually puts the sun's energy into 1  
to 4 sky patches, so the rtcontrib method will work, though it won't  
give very accurate shadows.  The total energy should still be correct  
if you do it right.

Another approach is to create a set of suns at different positions in  
the sky corresponding to the expected trajectory throughout the year,  
and interpolate these results in a separate rtcontrib run.  I have  
done it both ways, and the latter technique tends to produce slightly  
more accurate shadows.  The -dr option will work properly if you do  
this to calculate reflected beam radiation.

I regret that I don't have a script to provide,  but my 2005  
presentation covers this in overview:

Any ideas or have I misunderstood the usage of the -N option in rad.

Hi Terrance,

The trouble is that you are using the -i rendering option as if it  
were part of a view.  Very clever, and it works if you don't use the - 
N option of rad, but the mechanism behind the -N option with multiple  
views is that the view= variable is written to the stdin of an rpict  
running with the -S and -PP options, which shares memory on a  
multiprocessing platform.  In this mode, rpict just ignores any non- 
view options on stdin, which is why it isn't working as expected.

The latest HEAD allows you to run rad with -N on a single view (i.e.,  
"-v Plan" or "-v Plan-i" in your case), and it runs rpiece to split  
the work.  With your rad input file, you could run two rad processes,  
each with -N 4, one for each type of image, and get your job done in  
parallel that way.

I usually have a separate rad input file if I'm using the -i option,  
which I attach to the render= variable.  I had never thought of doing  
it your way.  Reprogramming rad to properly handle non-view options in  
view= settings would be a bit of work....

Message-ID: <H000008c0052dd64.1275467885.scalix.transgmbh.local@MHS>

Dear all,

I'm trying to visualize the effect of light traveling through
participating media. We want to use tracked mirrors to draw light beams
into a foggy or misty sky.

The fog example in RwR (p. 460) works well for artificial or electrical
light sources.
Is there also a opportunity to use direct sun light generated with
gensky instead of artificial light sources?

Maybe like:

void mist boundary
1 sun_light
0
7 0 0 0 .4 .4 .4 .45


Cheers Kai

Greg, all:

So what is the protocol for determining the number of patches the sun's energy is distributed across? In Axel Jacob's (excellent) tutorial on rtcontrib three patches are used to represent the sun regardless of whether the Tregenza or the finer Reinhart patch density/distributions are used, but you mention one to four patches being used, Greg. How or when would this number change? Does genskyvec actually make a choice?

It should work.  Did you try it?  The main requirement is that your  
mist has a finite extent.  Beware that the sun is a lousy source for  
creating visible beams in a uniform fog, as it floods light  
everywhere.  Similarly, redirected light by mirrors will likely be  
drowned out by the scattering of sunlight throughout the participating  
medium, unless you have some way to reflect the light from unfoggy  
regions to foggy regions.

Hi Rob,

Genskyvec always picks the three closest patches, regardless of the  
sky resolution.  It would be difficult to use a sky resolution high  
enough that one patch would be the better choice.  I only mentioned  
the 1-4 range because that's what people have done, not as a  
recommendation per se.

The important thing is to distribute energy according to which patches  
are closest, so if the sun really is in the middle of a particular  
patch, very little energy would be given to neighboring patches.  That  
"very little" should probably be zero in some cases, but I don't think  
it ever quite is in genskyvec with the weighting function I use.

Including yourself, Greg. Your rtcontutor directory that was in Radiance 
for a while used the four nearest patches. I guess your reasoning to 
reduce this to just three was something like this:

1 - too crude
2 - still only one-dimensional
3 - just perfect. The real sun will always be in the triangle formed by 
exactly three patch centres.
4 - Overkill

So in theory, if you we remove the patch intensity of the sky, we can 
determine the exact position of the sun if the intensity is known, or 
vice versa by triangulation. This is dictated by Greg's Uncertainty 
Principle. Think of it as sub-pixel interpolation in image processing.

Cheers

 Hi all,

Can the illum primitive be set to a maximum radius for shadow testing (like
the spotlight primitive) ?

My best,

The short answer is 'no,' the reason being that you only need to turn  
an object into an "illum" if its contribution is significant, which is  
the opposite of the reason you would want to turn something into a  
"glow."  If its influence is local, then treating it as whatever it is  
in the default calculation (using "glow" with an effective distance of  
0) should work fine in the ambient calculation.  Naturally, there are  
cases where it doesn't quite.

Best,
-Greg

 Dear group,

Two years after Greg's presentation (Fribourg 2008) on Surface Depth
Hallucination, I would like to experiment with the suggested procedure
within Radiance. The article "A Perceptually Validated Model for Surface
Depth Hallucination" says ''Once we have an albedo map and a depth map for
our surface, virtually any rendering algorithm may be applied. We use
the *Radiance
*physically-based renderer." Are there software or resources available which
describe in more detail how albedo and depth maps can be achieved and used
in Radiance?

My best,

Iebele

Hi Iebele,

The process to create a texture from flash/no-flash photography works,  
but is fairly involved.  For some time, Mashhuda & I have been working  
on creating a user interface to make the process more straightforward,  
but it is still a work-in-progress after 2 years.

All I have at this point is a set of programs and scripts that rely on  
dcraw and exiftool.  I have compiles for Mac OS X (10.4 and later, PPC 
+Intel), but no easy way to copile on other platforms.  If I provided  
these, you would still need some instructions on how to calibrate your  
flash & lens, and probably a fair amount of hand-holding through the  
process.

In addition to the single flash method described in the Siggraph paper  
and my talk, there is a 3-flash method that works better, but requires  
more hardware.  Here are the relevant papers:

Ward, Greg, M. Glencross, "A Case Study Evaluation: Perceptually  
Accurate Textured Surface Models," Sixth Symposium on Applied  
Perception in Graphics and Visualization (APGV), September 2009.
Glencross, Mashhuda, G. Ward, C. Jay, J. Liu, F. Melendez, R. Hubbold,  
"A Perceptually Validated Model for Surface Depth Hallucination," ACM  
Trans. Graph. (special issue SIGGRAPH 2008), August 2008.
I'm attaching some text describing the process for the single-flash  
method.  If you're still interested after reading all this, and have a  
Mac you want to try it on, I can provide the programs and scripts to  
you in a separate e-mail.

Cheers,
-Greg

Hi Greg,

I've had read both articles, and the text describing the process looks
doable. We use the same camera and have several flashes. Using 1 flash seems
better now, since I am not able to build the 3-flash controller (maybe
later). Mac is fine.
Anyway, I would be glad to try it,

A soda-water cheers,

Iebele

Hi Randolph,

You can convert it to MGF and from there to VRML (Inventor 2.0) format:

	rad2mgf input files ... | mgf2inv > combined.inv

You can build these tools in ray/src/cv/mgflib if you haven't done so  
already.  Textures don't come through, sadly.

Best,
-Greg

Hi Randolph,

Francesco Anselmo wrote a python script several years ago (rad2obj)  
that will convert RAD geometry to OBJ:

Hope this helps.

Hi Jill,

 

I believe IESNA is trying to have a stronger presence in daylighting.
For the past 6 years or so they have had a Daylighting Institute along
with a Lighting Institute which occurs for 2 days before the exhibit
hall opens at LightFair.  This includes two days of daylighting specific
presentations and relates to the "Daylighting Pavilion" they now
distinguish on the LightFair floor.  From 2004 - 2006ish there was also
a loose daylighting forum at LightFair organized by New Buildings
Institute (I believe) where industry representatives got together to
discuss the state of affairs.  Not much came from that and it fizzled.
There is also two IESNA committees focused on daylighting - the
daylighting committee (chaired by Kostas Papamichael and working on a
Daylighting RP-5) and the daylight metrics subcommittee (chaired by Lisa
Heschong and working on a dynamic daylight metric).  This year, as part
of a Daylighting Plus research project and the metric subcommittee
efforts, there was a new Daylighting Forum held at the end of LightFair
for 2 days.  Many of the who's who in daylighting attended and there
were good general discussions about the state of affairs for
daylighting, the need for metrics for a variety of code applications,
and the idea of making it a more regular forum came up - though nothing
concrete that I know of.

 

I'd like to see a daylighting forum continue as part of IESNA's
daylighting institute, and I'd like to see it occur in combination with
the classes during the LightFair event.  Alternatively, perhaps there
should be or already is a strong daylighting component to the CIE
activities.  I know there is some activity relative to climate based
daylight simulation but am not as familiar with CIE activities.

 

Cheers,

Zack

I apologize that this is not really a post regarding Radiance but
hopefully is still applicable to some users. 

Does anyone know of any professional daylighting groups or societies?
Especially one that is geared toward the consultant? I am aware of the
Daylighting Collaborative at the Energy Center of Wisconsin, however
their membership pricing structure does not seem to be geared toward the
independent consultant, but more toward larger manufacturers. I have
asked them about changing their pricing structure, but they do not seem
to want to budge.

Would anyone be interested in starting such a group with me? Or in
persuading the Daylighting Collaborative into changing their pricing
structure? Email me directly at jilldalglish@yahoo.com

     I have created two boxes and a pipe and I located the two boxes around
the pipe just as a dumb bell shape. I use a script file to combine these
objects and able to render them in different sizes in succession. In this
script file I'm using "xform" to locate these images. The problem is that I
have to re-render these images in different sizes however, when it is
rendered in different size, the pipe and the box are departing from each
other. I need to render these images 100 times in different sizes (their
size will diminish gradually) thus, I have to assign variables.

How can I assign variables to "xform -n column -s $n squares/Box1.rad |
xform -t 4.32 -10 -9 >> tmp.rad;" to the right side of the xform? I have
been trying for two days however I cannot get through it.

Dear Begum,

You need to provide more information on what you are doing.   
Specifically:

1) What is your view of the scene?
2) What is your current script for generating the scene?
3) What is wrong with the current script, precisely?

Just to make sure we're all talking about the same thing, when you say
"render these images ... In different sizes" I assume you mean the image is
the same size but the dumbell object is resized. (?)

One way to keep your dumbell assembly to remain constant is to place all the
objects (two boxes and the column) into one .rad file, and then scale/array
that .rad file with its own xform operation(s). Then all the components will
maintain the same spatial relationship.

But I may be totally misunderstanding what you're trying to do (no coffee
yet).

Randolph,

I never thought I'd say this, but how about Ecotect? Materials might be 
iffy though.

There's a free demo:

Hi Begum,

I have to admit that I did not really understand yet what exactly you 
want to do. On your original question though, you can use any shell 
script from within you scene with a preceding exclamation mark. It is up 
to you then what you do inside this script, e.g. call xform using some 
environment variables. You just need to make sure that it writes valid 
radiance geometry to stdout.

Kolay gelsin, Lars.

Greg, when I try this (after first running the Radiance files through 
xform to expand all the embedded commands) I see:
  $ rad2mgf expanded.rad | mgf2inv >x.vrml
  <stdin>: 36: Illegal argument value:
  m 50fin_mat =

My fallback was Anselmo's script, which seems to mostly work, though 
some geometry doesn't seem to have made it through.

Wish I had the resources to write a rad23dm script, oh, well...

Hello All,
I have a pic file of an indoor scene with windows that I want to test
with varying visible transmittance of the glass. Without having to run
rpict again, is there a way of dropping down the sky luminance using a
multiplier OR to uniformly drop down the light in the scene by combining
the pic (using pcomb) with pic file of a screen of a specific
transmittance? In other words, can I just filter down the light levels
uniformly in the scene without having to run rpict again.
Thanks.
Autif

Hi Randolph,

MGF requires that identifiers begin with a letter, and they can't  
contain spaces.  The rad2mgf program doesn't check to make sure  
identifiers are legal in MGF, so this is the problem.  You need to  
rename material and modifier names that don't begin with a letter, or  
I need to update rad2mgf to fix identifiers.

The short answer is 'yes.'  Light is linear, so you can always scale  
according to window transmittance for light coming through the  
window.  There may be some (very) slight inaccuracies due to the  
varying angular transmittance, but the results should be roughly  
correct.

If the window is the only source of light in the room, and you are  
adjusting the picture exposure rather than looking at the luminance/ 
radiance values, then you will see no change at all, because one will  
compensate for the other.

Thanks Greg,
Window is the only source of light in the room. I do want to get the
luminance values from the modified pic file, so it seems adjusting
exposure will not be the right approach. I was thinking pcomb could be
used for this, but have not been able to figure out how to do it yet.
Any suggestions or guidance would be great..

	window flash and gone very quickly
Message-ID: <AANLkTilO-MLxMVlabPfe6FnwG9E0mmOEomZ0A89OtWkm@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, everybody,

When I type "objline buildings.rad | x11meta" and return in the Terminal in
Mac OS X Snow Leopard, the *X11 window showed up for a very very short of
period and then disappeared immediately*.

As to my understanding, what we'll get by execute the objline command is an
image with four wire frame views of the geometry described in a specific
.rad file and the image window will stay on the screen rather than flash and
gone, am I right?

It seems the rest Radiance commands are still working. I can use Python to
execute in batch those most fundamental radiance commands like getinfo,
gensky, genbox, oconv, rpict, rvu, etc. with images displaying correctly.

So, can anybody help to point out what's wrong here and how to fix it?

Both my Mac OS X system and my Radiance are fresh installation.

I install the latest Radiance following the guide from the this website
after I tried and failed by following the README file in the installation
folder of Rad4R0.
http://www.designcommunity.com/forum/8756.html

Is it because my Radiance is not properly installed?

Really appreciate your help!

Ji,

Objline might bomb out if there are non-planar vertices in your model.

Thanks, John!

But I think the rad file I used should be OK because it only contains five
simple boxes and I can use rvu to generate a rendering for it.

Just now I tried to use the table.rad file got from Axel Jacobs' tutorial
and the objline still doesn't work. Moreover, there's an error message
showing in the Terminal:

*fatal - cannot open file "/usr/local/lib/ray/meta/vchars.mta", mode "r"*

I sense my Radiance has got big problem. What does this error message mean?

Should I reinstall Radiance?

What are the correct and detailed procedures to install Radiance on Mac OS X
Snow Leopard?

Thanks!

Ji

Hmmm, that's odd. The error means that the program could not open the file vchars.mta in a read-only capacity. Following a normal installation of Radiance on Mac OS X, that file should indeed live in /usr/local/lib/ray/meta and be read-only accessible to everyone. 

So yeah it's possible that something didn't go right during installation. The correct and not-totally-detailed procedures for installing Radiance on the Mac are:

go to www.radiance-online.org, click the link on the left for "download radiance", and follow the procedures found under "Download official release from this server". Basically you grab the source code, and compile. Compiling on the Mac is easy, you run ./makeall install from the directory where you unpack the archive, and follow the prompts. You need to run this as an admin, and in Mac OS this is easy:

sudo ./makeall install

This will prompt you for the administrator password, and then you just follow the prompts. 

NOTE: you must have the directory /usr/local/lib/ray already existing so the installer can place all the library files. This is done with 

sudo mkdir /usr/local/lib/ray

Maybe this was your problem the first time around? Here's a quick rundown of the steps:

1. download http://www.radiance-online.org/software/rad3R9all.tar.gz 
2. at the command prompt, go to the directory where you saved the rad3R9all.tar.gz file
3. type: gunzip < rad3R9all.tar.gz | tar xf -
4. go to the archive directory (cd ray)
5. create /usr/local/lib/ray directory if it does not exist (sudo mkdir /usr/local/lib/ray)
6. type sudo ./makeall install (supply admin password when asked)
7. follow the prompts, responding to defaults; definitely answer 'y' when asked if you want to install libraries, accept default location
8. make the PATH changes recommended after installation. 

Give that a go, and retry objline.

I have been wanting to write a rhino script to export to rad format directly from Rhino for a while now, but never have the time (or detailed knowledge of rhino script). An option to export materials by layer name for models where material names are not already defined (or not defined consistently) has also been my desire. This would save the typical go-between of exporting from Rhino to obj then obj2rad.

On the other hand, the obj2rad step is not very time consuming and usually works well. I also like doing things via obj2rad from Sketchup anyway. No offense to the su2rad plugin, but it makes file structure more consistent regardless of what software the geometry comes from. With that considered, maybe a rhino script to copy layer names to the material names would be just as useful and easier, and just stick with the obj export method.

Dear Rob, thank you very much for your detailed explanation!!!

However, I still couldn't get the radiance installed in the default
directories follow the steps suggested by you.

The following are the messages shown in the Terminal during installation
(within the area maked by #):

####################################################################
Ji-ZHANGs-iMac:ray jizhang$ sudo ./makeall install

        RADIANCE 4.0a INSTALLATION

This script rebuilds all of the Radiance programs and installs
them on your system.  You should read the file README before running
this script.  You can type ^C (followed by return) at any time to abort.

You must first answer the following questions.

What is your preferred editor [vi]?
Where do you want the executables [/usr/local/bin]?
Current rmake command is:
#!/bin/sh
exec make "SPECIAL=ogl" \
    "OPT=-O2" \

####################################################################

When this "unsuccessful" installation finished, there seem to be no file at
all in the /usr/local/lib/ray directory...

and no radiance executable can be found in the /usr/local/bin directory
either......

So, can you help to take a look and point out what the problem here is?

BTW, the Terminal I'm using in Mac OS X Snow Leopard is titled "Terminal -
bash -95x50".

Thank you!

Ji

You are using the alternative installation method, which means copying  
the binaries.  What you forgot to do is run "makeall library" to  
install the library files.  That's all you need to get things working,  
I hope.

If you want to rebuild the system, you'll need to install the (free)  
Apple Developer's Tools, first.

Oops. Yeah, I guess step zero is: "get the developer tools installed on your system". Sorry about that!

The developer tools (now called XCode) include the compiler and the program "make", which you need to compile the source code (and its absence on your system is causing all your error messages there). XCode is a free (but large) download from Apple:

http://developer.apple.com/technologies/xcode.html

You have to create a developer account, but its free and amounts to a login/password. Grab XCode and install it, making sure you install all the X11 dev stuff, then go back to that ray directory and try rerunning ./makeall install and we'll go from there.

The developer tools are also on the Snow Leopard install DVD if you have it.

Oops. Yeah, I guess step zero is: "get the developer tools installed on your system". Sorry about that!

The developer tools (now called XCode) include the compiler and the program "make", which you need to compile the source code (and its absence on your system is causing all your error messages there). XCode is a free (but large) download from Apple:

http://developer.apple.com/technologies/xcode.html

You have to create a developer account, but its free and amounts to a login/password. Grab XCode and install it, making sure you install all the X11 dev stuff, then go back to that ray directory and try rerunning ./makeall install and we'll go from there.

Dear Rob, thank you very much for your detailed explanation!!!

However, I still couldn't get the radiance installed in the default directories follow the steps suggested by you.

This script rebuilds all of the Radiance programs and installs
them on your system.  You should read the file README before running
this script.  You can type ^C (followed by return) at any time to abort.

You must first answer the following questions.

What is your preferred editor [vi]?

When this "unsuccessful" installation finished, there seem to be no file at all in the /usr/local/lib/ray directory...

and no radiance executable can be found in the /usr/local/bin directory either......

So, can you help to take a look and point out what the problem here is?

BTW, the Terminal I'm using in Mac OS X Snow Leopard is titled "Terminal - bash -95x50".

Thank you!

So yeah it's possible that something didn't go right during installation. The correct and not-totally-detailed procedures for installing Radiance on the Mac are:

go to www.radiance-online.org<http://www.radiance-online.org/>, click the link on the left for "download radiance", and follow the procedures found under "Download official release from this server". Basically you grab the source code, and compile. Compiling on the Mac is easy, you run ./makeall install from the directory where you unpack the archive, and follow the prompts.

NOTE: you must have the directory /usr/local/lib/ray already existing so the installer can place all the library files. This is done with

sudo mkdir /usr/local/lib/ray

Maybe this was your problem the first time around? Here's a quick rundown of the steps:

1. download http://www.radiance-online.org/software/rad3R9all.tar.gz
2. at the command prompt, go to the directory where you saved the rad3R9all.tar.gz file
3. type: gunzip < rad3R9all.tar.gz | tar xf -
4. go to the archive directory (cd ray)
5. create /usr/local/lib/ray directory if it does not exist (sudo mkdir /usr/local/lib/ray)
6. type sudo ./makeall install (supply admin password when asked)
7. follow the prompts, responding to defaults; definitely answer 'y' when asked if you want to install libraries, accept default location
8. make the PATH changes recommended after installation.

Give that a go, and retry objline.

I sense my Radiance has got big problem. What does this error message mean?

Should I reinstall Radiance?

Randolph,

You may want to look into what Christoph Reinhart (at Harvard GSD) is 
developing right now (due out...this summer?). I went to a workshop of 
his last summer and he and his grad students demoed some very interested 
Rhino/Grasshopper tools to go directly to and from Radiance. I, for one, 
am anxiously awaiting this to be released.

Hi all,

I've been using rtcontrib to look at different window contributions in  
a space under an overcast sky.  When I 'pcomb' the resultant images  
and compare the illuminance values to an image generated with 'rad' I  
get light levels 1/3 of what I'm getting in the rad generated image.

For the rtcontrib routine I used:
oconv mat.rad d_cie.rad d_c1.rad d_c2.rad d_c3.rad d_c5.rad d_c6.rad  
d_c7.rad d_c9.rad d_c130.rad d_c131.rad d_c132.rad d_c133.rad  
d_c134.rad d_c255.rad > punch_40.oct

vwrays -ff -x 1024 -y 1024 -vf plan_1.vf | rtcontrib -ffc -I+ -V+  
`vwrays -d -x 1024 -y 1024 -vf plan_1.vf` @options.opt -o images/plan1_ 
%s.pic -M glass.txt punch_40.oct

The parameters set in the 'options.opt' file are:
-n 2
-ab 5
-ad 8000
-as 2000
-ar 800
-dt 0
-dc 1
-ds .2
-lw .000001

the "glass.txt' file contains the different glass geometries:
d_c130
d_c131
d_c132
d_c133

For the 'pcomb' routine:
pcomb -o plan_1_d_c130.hdr  -o plan_1_d_c131.hdr -o plan_1_d_c132.hdr - 
o plan_1_d_c133.hdr > plan_1_all_glass.hdr

For the 'rad' routine:
rpict -t 60 -vu 0 0 1 -vf plan_1.vf -x 2700 -y 2700 -dp 4096 -ar 323 - 
ms 0.31 -ds .2 -dt .05 -dc .75 -dr 3 -sj 1 -st .01  -aa .1 -ad 1536 - 
as 768 -av 0 0 0 -lr 12 -lw .0005 -ab 3 -i -ps 3 -pt .04 -o plan_1.unf  
d.oct

I'm sure I'm missing somethng, but am just not sure what.


Thanks!

Hi Chris,

Could the -I+ option you're giving to rtcontrib be substituted with  
the -i+ option?  The former would compute an array of irradiance  
values surrounding your -vp setting, rather than an irradiance image  
of intersected surfaces.  I wouldn't think the images would look very  
similar in this case.  Did you compare the appearance of rtcontrib -I+  
versus rpict -i?

-Greg

Thanks Greg, that was the problem and the needle I was looking for.  I  
don't think I would have figured that out anytime soon.

Should be possible, but why give up the advantages of the dimensionless 
source-object? With cubical maps you must think about where in you cube 
the scene is to be located, how much related error to accept, then, how 
to get the increased scene bounding box reflected in the ambient setting...

Cheers, Lars.

Thank you very much, *John Mardaljevic, **Rob Guglielmetti, **Greg Ward, **and
Matt Franks, for your kind help!

Now the Radiance is installed and functioning well on my Mac OS.

Thanks, folks. That sounds really interesting. &, in the interests of 
not re-inventing the wheel, I think I will contact Reinhart next & see 
if he wants a tester.

Although, Grasshopper doesn't yet run on Mac Rhino, hmmm...

Thanks, Lars. The big reason for doing this is to make it possible to 
use a captured sky, and it's probably easier to keep the exterior 
housing containing cameras clean if it's got flat surfaces, than if 
it's a sphere.

Using a cube map and actually mapping a cube are separable issues.   
You don't need local geometry to do this in other words.  The mapping,  
which you can translate pretty easily to a .cal file, is given in Paul  
Debevec's image-based lighting chapter in the HDR Imaging book,  
Section 9.4.4.  Quoting:

World to Image:
if Dz<0 and Dz<Dx and Dz<Dy
u = 1.5 - 0.5 * Dx / Dz
v = 2.5 - 0.5 * Dy / Dz
else if Dz>0 and Dz>Dx and Dz>Dy
u = 1.5 + 0.5 * Dx / Dz
v = 0.5 + 0.5 * Dy / Dz
else if Dy<0 and Dy<Dx and Dy<Dz
u = 1.5 + 0.5 * Dx / Dy
v = 1.5 - 0.5 * Dz / Dy
else if Dy>0 and Dy>Dx and Dy>Dz
u = 1.5 + 0.5 * Dx / Dy
v = 3.5 + 0.5 * Dz / Dy
else if Dx<0 and Dx<Dy and Dx<Dz
u = 0.5 - 0.5 * Dz / Dx
v = 2.5 + 0.5 * Dy / Dx
else if Dx>0 and Dx>Dy and Dx>Dz
u = 2.5 + 0.5 * Dz / Dx
v = 2.5 + 0.5 * Dy / Dx

Image to World:
if u>=1 and u <=2 and v>=0 and v<=1 // up
Vx = (u - 0.5) * 6
Vy = 1.0
Vz = (v - 0.125) * -8
else if u>=0 and u <=1 and v>=1 and v<=2 // left
Vx = -1.0;
Vy = (v - 0.375) * -8;
Vz = (u ? 1/6) * -6;
else if u>=1 and u <=2 and v>=1 and v<=2 // forward
Vx = (u - 0.5) * 6;
Vy = (v - 0.375) * -8;
Vz = -1.0;
else if u>=2 and u <=3 and v>=1 and v<=2 // right
Vx = 1.0;
Vy = (v - 0.375) * -8;
Vz = (u ? 5/6) * 6;
else if u>=1 and u <=2 and v>=2 and v<=4 // down
Vx = (u - 0.5) * 6;
Vy = -1.0;
Vz = (v - 0.625) * 8;
else if u>=1 and u <=2 and v>=3 and v<=4 // backward
Vx = (u - 0.5) * 6;
Vy = (v - 0.875) * 8;
Vz = 1.0;
normalize = 1 / sqrt(Vx * Vx + Vy * Vy + Vz * Vz)
Dx = normalize* Vx
Dy = normalize* Vy
Dz = normalize* Vz

Subject: [Radiance-general] Job Posting: Daylight and Climate Concept
	Development and Validation Engineer
Message-ID: <4C1631A5.7000102@transsolar.com>

Transsolar is a German-based climate engineering firm, and one of the 
premier such offices in the world. We are seeking talented, highly 
motivated engineers for our New York office.  Our current needs place 
special emphasis on daylighting specialists with grounding in 
engineering science.

Transsolar develops and validate concepts for high quality environments 
that require minimal energy use. To achieve this we work collaboratively 
within the design team from the start of the design process, considering 
each step from the standpoint of fundamental thermodynamics. This 
generates a climate concept in which form, material, and mechanical 
systems are synergistic components of a well-orchestrated climate 
control system; and conversely, an environmental control strategy that 
is integral to the architectural concept.
We use a wide variety of computer simulation tools to evaluate our 
concepts. We perform daylight simulations using RADIANCE, with 
evaluation based on a wide variety of metrics, increasingly expanding to 
climate-based daylight metrics.  Similarly, we perform dynamic thermal 
simulation using TRNSYS and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) using FLUENT.

Transsolar engineers are often specialized in their work, but all carry 
out a broad range of tasks. Responsibilities may include but are not 
limited to:
.    Design and validation of ongoing projects via RADIANCE, TRNSYS, or 
FLUENT simulation
.    Collaboration with German Transsolar offices
.    Project coordination
.    Participation in meetings and design charettes
.    Graphical representation of climate and energy concepts
.    Writing reports and correspondence
.    Domestic and international travel to project meetings and sites

Engineers with an emphasis on daylight simulation, including 
climate-based metrics, are our highest priority, but experts in dynamic 
thermal simulation are also of interest.  Both entry-level positions and 
positions for 3-5 years experience are available.  Our New York office 
is small but growing, providing ample opportunity for advancement.

Preferred qualifications include:
.    Proven ability to creatively develop and apply non-traditional 
climate solutions to the indoor environment
.    Education related to building energy flows and building science: 
heat transfer, thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, solar geometry and 
daylighting, etc. Ideal is a degree in mechanical engineering. An M.S. 
is preferred but not required.
.    Familiarity with basics of computational analysis (text-based 
input, computer programming, spreadsheet analysis)
.    Experience with daylight simulation and climate-based daylight metrics
.    Experience with electric lighting design and simulation
.    Experience with dynamic thermal/energy simulation
.    Experience with computational fluid dynamics in built environment 
applications
.    Education/professional experience with architectural, mechanical, 
and lighting systems for building climate control
.    Excellent oral and written communication skills
.    Computer-based drawing skills (e.g. Corel Draw, Adobe Illustrator, etc)

Interested applicants may submit their resume and work samples via email 
to nycjobs@transsolar.com

I would be careful with that. If you have a dome with a wide-angle 
camera, transmission is about perpendicular for all directions. If you 
have a flat glass, it is not. Do you want to a cube-shaped box with five 
cameras?

Cheers, Lars.

Randolph's query reminded me that I had a search for cheap domes a  
while ago.  This is what I found:

http://www.hammacher.com/publish/75098.asp?cm_mmc=CJ-_-1414665-_-1492714-_-Hammacher+Schlemmer

Difficult to tell from the photo if it is optically suitable, though  
Fido looks quite happy.  I'd be interested to hear if this is any good  
as a housing.

Woof woof!

That was actually pretty much what I was visualizing. Any model, we'd 
have to experiment.

Message-ID: <55847c24faf43e8151d724212c9e1dd1.squirrel@calmail.berkeley.edu>

I have an HDR image that was generated by combining the original HDR with
an equally sized bitmap image to mask out an area within the image for
analysis. I have a script that enables the average luminance of the masked
area to be computed via (from the below script):

taskavg=`thpic -o $inp $tdir/$task.pic | toflt | total -if`

*I would like to compute the standard deviation of only the non-zero
pixels and am unsure how to do this.

the program "total" has a number of options to calculate the mean, max,
min, RMS,etc, but i need to filter out all of the zero'ed pixels before/as
I pass the pixel data to it.

Any suggestions would be appreciated. I have put a sample image (out.hdr)
as well as the script, mask, and orig image (example.hdr) in the following
directory online

Hi Kyle,

Between your toflt and total put the following:

... | toflt | rcalc -if -of -e '$1=$1;cond=1e-6-$1' | total -if ...

You probably should add a "-o" option here, too, unless you always use
images fresh from rpict (no further pfilt treatment).

You probably should add a "-o" option here, too, unless you always use
images fresh from rpict (no further pfilt treatment).

Dear RADIANCE-specialists,

after downloading the source codes (rad4R0all.tar.gz) from the original
LBNL-website we unpacked the files und ran the install script by the command
./makeall install. But something must have gone wrong, because after the
installation we are missing some important moduls (e.g. pfilt, ximage,
ta_tiff, etc.), see attached output of the install-script.

Can us anyone tell what?s going wrong during installation ?

Regards,
Gunter

    Hi Gunter  ?  pfilt at least seems to have been built - no error
messages there. Is the actual binary missing in the source tree or is it
"just not installed" in the /bin directory?  
Towards the end of your log the program "wish" is reported missing and
subsequently "trad" is not installed.

  Best  Achim  ?

Hi Gunter,

it is a bit strange to see the error, because the binaries were actually 
build, just not copied to the target directory (except trad).

One general comment is that I would avoid spaces and special characters 
in directory and file names. It is easy to have make get confused:

/Projekt/downloaded-Sourcefiles/RADIANCE_Srcfiles/version 4.0

I'd make it version-4.0 and try again...

Cheers, Lars.

Hi Gunter,

The usual reason that the binaries from the src/px directory fail to  
install is because the TIFF library isn't building properly.   
Unfortunately, there are many reasons why this might happen, and  
debugging it is beyond my abilities.  You'll just have to remove  
ra_tiff and normtiff from the PROGS= list in src/px/Rmakefile and  
rerun "rmake install" there.

Cheers,
-Greg

Message-ID: <AANLkTinrYz_3K3rh1VxAHaehOwaBF83V1zHO_N0NgOG1@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Radiance experts,

May I ask if there's a latest version of Radiance (4.0) built for Ubuntu
system?

What I can find and install via the "Ubuntu software center" is "Radiance
3R9+20100109-1".

If I'm not wrong "Radiance 4R0" has already been published in the Radiance
webiste (http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/framed.html).

So, where can I can find the Radiance 4.0 installer for Ubuntu 10.04 system?


Or, can I download the "rad4R0all.tar.gz" from the Radiance website and
install it in Ubuntu?

If it is, then what are the detailed procedures to
1) uninstall the Radiance 3.9 currently installed on my Ubuntu and
2) use this "rad4R0all.tar.gz" file to install Radiance 4.0 on Ubuntu in the
Terminal?

Thanks!

Ji

Ubuntu was frozen when 4R0 was released. Either use Debian or make a simple
backport:

apt-get install devscripts fakeroot
apt-get build-dep radiance
dget -xu
http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/pool/main/r/radiance/radiance_4R0+20100331-1.dsc

cd radiance-4R0+20100331
dpkg-buildpackage
cd ..
dpkg -i radiance*.deb

Hi, Radiance experts:

Following Axel Jacobs' "Basic Radiance Tutorial" on page 23,
I run "gensky 12 09 14 -a 51 -o 0 -m 0" in the Terminal of Mac OS X, the
output is (quoted in # symbol):

#####################################################
# gensky 12 09 14 -a 51 -o 0 -m 0

# Solar altitude and azimuth: 11.0 29.9

#####################################################

However, two parts of this result are different from that wrote in Axel
Jacobs'  tutorial:

1) In Axel's tutorial, line 4 of the output is:
# Ground ambient level: 8.7

2) In Axel's tutorial, the last line of the output is:
7 1 3.76e+00 3.72e+00 2.98e-01 -0.489041 -0.851114 0.190903

So, Which output is the correct one? What might causes the differences?

Thanks!

Ji

The default turbidity factor changed in 2006, but it seems Axel must  
have been using an older version of gensky.  Neither the new result or  
the old result is "correct" in the sense that the sky is unreal.   
Absolute values never mean much in daylighting calculations unless you  
have a measured sky.  This is why we recommend using the -B (-r) and - 
R (-r) options to calibrate gensky output against measurements if you  
care about absolute levels.

Hi Ji Zhang

The Radiance Tutorial must be about ten years old now. I keep updating 
it, fixing small typos and inconsistencies, but have not felt the need 
to reflect the recent changes to gensky's turbidity.

Both, CIE clear and overcast are extremes that are fairly unlikely to 
occur in reality. As Greg said, you really need to feed in measurements, 
and also have a good guess at the turbidity if you are concerned about 
accuracy. If you can supply diffuse and direct irradiation, you might 
want to use gendaylit instead.

Just a side-note:  the turbidity factor is _only_ used by gensky to  
estimate the zenith luminance.  If the horizontal irradiance or zenith  
radiance is given using -B or -b (respectively), turbidity is ignored.

Dear Saskia,

I try to help out a bit, even though I will not provide you with any 
such value here. I hope that I will be able to explain why.

First, the term. I guess you are referring to specular reflectance, 
maybe also direct transmittance. These define the fraction of light 
getting reflected / transmitted directly. With a lot of simplification 
something like incident angle equals outgoing angle for reflection 
(mirror), or light passing straight through (glass). Be aware that the 
real world is not that simple, but let us assume it is.

If you want to measure the specular reflectance, you typically do it 
indirect. A very common approach is to use an integrating sphere with 
either a photocell (if you do not need color information) or a 
spectrometer connected. In a first run, you would measure the total 
reflectance. In the second, you would open a small hole in the sphere so 
that light reflected according to the "incident=outgoing angle"-rule 
would simply escape the sphere and thus be skipped in the measurement. 
This leads to the diffuse reflectance. Substracting both would give you 
the specular reflectance. For transmissive samples, the procedure works 
more or less the same. Doing a direct measurement is rather 
complicated... Measurements on an integrating sphere are a standard 
measurement.

The procedure seams to be straight forward. However it is not. First, 
you can never measure only one outgoing direction, and you never have 
only one incident direction. There is always an angular range, larger 
then zero. Imagine the device for the measurement described above - 
there will be a light beam used, and that is not perfectly parallel and 
has a diameter. And if you open a hole in the sphere, that has more then 
zero mm^2 area - thus it excludes more then one direction. In other 
terms, you are always talking about solid angles.

The reason is not only imperfection in making measurement devices. Even 
a very good mirror reflects light not only into one direction. For each 
incident direction you will always get a distribution of reflected and, 
sometimes, transmitted light. There are some labs offering measurement 
of such distributions (maybe you have seen candela distributions for 
electrical lighting - it is something like that), I have been working at 
one until just recently. Using the measured data is not simple, as the 
data isn't. That is why the observation that for some surfaces, there 
are predominant directions where most of the light is directed to, led 
to the use of terms such as specular and diffuse. We use these 
simplifications to be able to describe the characteristics and, in 
simulation, we use these to optimize algorithms.

Now, for building materials, you will find very different levels of 
support from manufacturers. Some will give you detailed information on 
reflective and transmissive properties (go to the website of Alanod, 
they let you download the bidirectional reflection distribution data of 
their frontside mirrors - the distribution I describe in the paragraphe 
above at a high angular resolution). Quite a lot of manufacturer of 
materials where lighting is involved will give you some values like 
direct/specular and diffuse (glazing, sunshades, ...) but not more. And 
then, a lot of manufacturers may be able to give you color information.

You will also find that, depending on the application, different terms 
are used when talking about reflective and transmissive characteristics. 
Gloss, shininess, application standards differ often from what is more 
established in physics.

The conclusion is that there is no way to simply collect specularity 
values of building materials. Define what you are interested in and what 
your application is. If you are talking about appearance, energy 
transports, ... Are you looking at facades? Glass? Paints? Different 
polishing techniques?

I hope that this helps to find a starting point...

Cheers, Lars.

Dear all,

Has anybody got any pointers on modelling Sunpipes or light tubes?

I'm guessing the approach may involve separating the problem in to two 
domains: The pipe itself with a high level of ambient bounce and then 
the diffuser/ room setup.

Hi Chris!

Typical light pipes are made of highly specular surfaces, thus the  
ambient bounces is not the most critical. The questions are

- rectangular or round section
- only specular or specular plus diffuse
- sunny or overcast / cloudy sky

Have a look at the photon map if you need a very general approach.

Cheers,

Lars.

Message-ID: <4C2391E0.8010803@transsolar.com>

Hi All,

I finally got R4 running (on Ubuntu 10.04) thanks to Bernd's posting two 
days ago - thanks Bernd!

Now I'm running a couple tests to put it through its paces. The first 
thing I noticed - and this is a problem I encountered a couple weeks ago 
when first attempting R4 - is that it seems to scan my entire 
materials.rad file, even for materials not used in the current octree. 
It was crashing at missing cal files referenced in my materials.rad file 
(the material defs for which I deleted, now it runs fine). Does this 
sound right? Does R4 check all the materials, even if they aren't being 
used?

Thanks,
Cramer

Hi Cramer,

Radiance should parse materials.rad (only) if you include it into your  
scene. I guess you are referring to the file materials.rad from the  
distribution. If you include it, you should also have the required cal- 
files on your syste
. So just make sure that your RAYPATH is set correctly for your  
installation!

Besides that, including default material files can be tricky. Radiance  
does not complain about defining a modifier using the same name  
twice... you may end up with unexpected results if some default  
material definition overwrites what you wanted to use. Just take care!

Cheers, Lars.

Hi Rob,

Shows how good my memory is. That is a great test that you did along 
with the final eye opening clarification from Andy.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Modeling interior fabric roller shades in DAYSIM
Message-ID: <AANLkTileG24rkqnEPWkUujA7ZVqsgAXzmOoChWSynjV7@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Is there a way to model interior fabric roller shades in DAYSIM? As far as I
understand, the default in the simple dynamic shading device model is a
simplified model which transmits 25% of diffuse radiation when the shading
is closed. Is there a way to modify this transmittance so that it matches
the transmittance of a specific fabric?

Or would it be better to use the advanced shading device model? If it is the
latter, can the *.rad files required for input into the model both be
material rad files as opposesed to geometry rad files (since I am only
seeking to change the material properties of the interior shades, not
looking to define a complex geometry)?

Thank you,

Message-ID: <4C29A75A.5040003@bzed.de>

Hi,

seems there was a pov2rad.c some (long?) time ago, but the webpage is dead and I
can't find it somewhere else? Was it open source? If so, does anybody have a
copy of the source for me?

Thanks,

Bernd

I wrote a simple converter in Python a few years ago. It was rather
limited, though, and only dealt with POV files created by Dialux.

I'll have to dig around my hard drive to find that.

Guess that won't work for me, I'm looking more for some general converter as
we're facing the problem that povray is not free according to the Debian Free
Software Guidelines, so we can't use it to render stuff for Debian main. Any
other povray replacements woruld work for me, too, of course :)

Thanks and cheers,

Bernd

Subject: [Radiance-general] 9th International Radiance Workshop @ ISE,
	Germany
Message-ID: <4C2B3C5D.4050403@ise.fraunhofer.de>


Dear colleagues,

As previously announced Fraunhofer ISE will be hosting this year?s
International Radiance Workshop on September 20/21(22) at our
institute in Freiburg, Germany.


The International Radiance Workshops are annual, two-day gatherings of
Radiance developers and users. The workshops consist of a series of
presentations that in the past included case studies on the use of
Radiance in lighting and/or daylighting projects, recent advances in
modeling glare and energy savings from lighting controls as well as the
use of Radiance in Art and Design. Presentations from previous workshops
can be downloaded from http://www.radiance-online.org/.


The workshop will be held on two days (Monday, Tuesday, 20-21st
September). On Wednesday 22nd we intend to hold a special course on
modeling advanced fenestration systems. Topics at this course will be
rtcontrib, photon mapping and material measurements/modeling.

The workshop web-site will be online in the next days and the link will
be announced in a separate email. On that site you can find more
informations + registration formula. We try to put the site online as
soon as possible, since the hotel bookings are unfortunately somewhat
difficult in that time and they cannot reserve a large contingent for a
longer time.

If you are interested in presenting at the workshop please send us a
working title and a brief abstract to jan.wienold@ise.fraunhofer.de
 and sandra.mende@ise.fraunhofer.de

We are looking forward to receiving your abstracts and welcoming you to
Freiburg!


Jan Wienold and Sandra Mende
Fraunhofer ISE,

Subject: [Radiance-general] gensky: what's the unit of the value specified
	for the "-b" option?
Message-ID: <AANLkTim1EgM-DFzcRRW2Nw00bput83-z3WcN3fApSUsL@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Radiance experts,

May I ask what is the unit for the value specified after the "-b" option of
the "gensky" command?

According to Axel Jacob's "Radiance Tutorial" p. 24 and "Radiance Cookbook"
p.35, if we want to define an overcast sky with the horizontal illumination
level being 10,000 lx, we need to specify the zenith brightness with an
irradiance value of 22.86(W/m2) for the "-b" option in gensky command.

However, according to the gensky menu, what we need to specify for the "-b"
option is the zenith brightness as an "radiance" value of which the unit
should be watts/steradian/m2.

I assume that the term "radiance" and "irradiance" should not be used
interchangeably as they are different concepts, am I right?

So, which one is correct? Axel's tutorial or the gensky menu?


Or more specifically, for "Formula 4" in Axel Jacob's "Radiance Tutorial" p.
24 that specify the relationship between zenith brightness and horizontal
illuminance: R_zenith = (9/7)*(E_horiz/179/PI)

What are the units for "R_zenith" and "E_horiz" exactly?

If the unit for "R_zenith" is watts/steradian/m2, then it's a "radiance"
value.

But if the unit for "R_zenith" is watts/m2, then it's a "irradiance" value.

Correct me if I'm wrong.

Thanks!

Ji
