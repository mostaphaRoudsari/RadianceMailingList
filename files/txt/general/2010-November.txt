Dear mailing list members,

I have been experimenting with our new scientific grade CCD camera which 
I suppose can be used as an imaging photometer. Yes, after some 
extensive calibration!

I would like to take some measurements of diffuse reflectance. The 
classical setup will require an integrating sphere. Well... the 
University I work at will not afford such an expensive device. I'm sure 
there would be another way to estimate it. I guess it is possible to 
acquire BRDF and to make some diffuse reflectance estimation?

Below are my questions:

1. Is there way to estimate diffuse reflectance without using of 
integrating sphere? Also, to some extent, can the reflectance measured 
under overcast sky conditions be referred to as diffuse reflectance?

2. How do you calibrate your CCD cameras for taking luminance measurements?

3. With uncalibrated camera, I guess the reflectance values can be 
estimated using HDR shots of GretagMacbeth ColorChecker chart as 
reference. The ColorChecker chart's reflectance values are known, right? 
So, it is possible to compare the values from the shot of a sample 
against the values from the shot of the chart to estimate the 
reflectance of the sample?! But where can I get the GretagMacbeth 
ColorChecker Rendition chart's RGB reflectance values? I wonder if 
anyone have measured them?!

4. What are in the "macbeth_spec.hdr" and "macbeth_pub.hdr" files? What 
data are in these files?

5. Having estimated BRDF for a particular material sample can we 
estimate the material's diffuse reflectance?

Thanks,
Ilya

Subject: [Radiance-general] daylighting matrix
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=LCGt-MjLbr=9CkBEMmdtK4wtkYLffLsC692w8@mail.gmail.com>

Hello experts:

I am learning the tutorial "The Three-Phase Daylight Coefficient Method for
Simulating Complex Fenestration with Radiance". I am very confused with the
daylighting matrix.  Daylighting matrix should be a matrix with size of
 KlemsDivision* SkyPatches. Is that right D-matrix tells me
the contributions of  each sky patch to each Klems division (each angle?)?
If so, different point in the window area should have different D-matrix
because the sky patches' contributions to the same direction in different
positions of window are different, in other words, the D matrix is
different. But in fact, there is only one D matrix for a window. Could
someone explain how daylighting matrix works?

Thank you,

Jia

When you say "the sky patches' contributions to the same direction in
different positions of window are different", are you referring to the
effect of shading elements on the window, making those contributions
different? Because in order to model this accurately, you are correct in
that you need more daylight matrices (i.e. need to subdivide the window).
Andy covers this really well in his (fabulous) tutorial (see the Appendix,
"Additional Considerations").

Hello Rob:

Thank you. Yes and I mean the luminance distribution in the window may not
be uniform in case of shading or obstructions. Now I understand more D
matrices are need to used with shading systems. I think about this hard but
forgot to read the appendix.

Very quickly, you can look at the "Tools for Materials" section of the SIGGRAPH '96 course notes here:

	http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/sg96crs.pdf

The Radiance tool you want to check out is macbethcal, and you can look in src/px/macbethcal.c to find the MacBeth color checker measurements.  There are some tips as well in Chapter 5 of "Rendering with Radiance" if you have that.

On a Mac, you can use Photosphere from <www.anyhere.com> to calibrate a camera, as described in Mehlika Inanici's technical reort:

	http://gaia.lbl.gov/btech/papers/57545.pdf

Hi Ilya!

> under overcast sky conditions be referred to as diffuse reflectance?

Yes, the integrating sphere is only one possible instrument. "Diffuse 
reflectance" is usually referring to direct-hemispherical reflectance 
without whatever is defined as specular. The problem with turning it the 
way that you measure it as hemispherical-direct (incident light over 
hemisphere, measured at perpendicular angle) is that you must know the 
BRDF, and as far as I understand the idea, would need a uniform 
hemispherical source (overcast is non-uniform). A small integrating 
sphere is not all that expensive, by the way...

> 2. How do you calibrate your CCD cameras for taking luminance measurements?

Again - using an integrating sphere, a stabilized light source, and a 
calibrated detector as a reference. One example where we did that was 
presented at the Radiance Workshop in 2008:

http://www.radiance-online.org/radiance-workshop7/Content/Jacobs/jacobs-fribourg2008d.pdf

They are printed on its back, and you can assume the chart to be a nice 
diffuse surface. However, the pixel values in you picture represent 
luminance (or radiance), not reflectance!

> 4. What are in the "macbeth_spec.hdr" and "macbeth_pub.hdr" files? What

I think the spec-file is the reference giving the chart, while the 
pub-chart may be used for calculations, but I am not sure now. The image 
files are used for macbethcal-"calibrations".

> 5. Having estimated BRDF for a particular material sample can we

If you have measured the BRDF (which is done using other instruments 
then an integrating sphere, and a bit more complicated), you can derive 
the diffuse reflectance by integrating the transmission hemisphere's 
data and substracting the integral of the specular range. If you start 
with estimating a BRDF, I have my doubts that you will end up with 
correct values. Using a grey-chart and comparing using you eyes may be 
more promising. But maybe you do both and compare your results.

Cheers, Lars.

Dear Radiance community,

Does anybody have any interest in a generic Radiance wrapper package for
Python? I think I'm going to make one (and make it open source), and was
wondering if anybody had any interest, suggestions, advice, code they would
be willing to contribute, etc. I'm aiming for a 1:1 functionality but I know
there are going to be some things that will be tough/impossible to do.

I made what I think a simple program could be like below - it imports
geometry, creates a series of images, manipulates and combines those images,
then saves them.

The benefits of this are the flexibility of working within a higher level
scripting language. You open up the possibility of scripting complex
problems, parameteric geometry, iterative solutions, and ultimately,
adaptive design. This comes at the slight disadvantage of speed and the
flexibility of pipes, etc.

Why Python? I know it isn't as revered or speedy as C or Perl, but it has a
very simple syntax and a lot of the 3rd party tools as of late seem to be
written in Python. It's also available on all platforms and in some modeling
packages such as Rhino 5, Max (Py3dsMax), Blender, etc.

Ultimately, it could be the engine behind an OpenDX / Grasshopper like GUI
for Radiance. I'll leave that up to someone else though.

So, yeah. Any interest?

--Dave

P.S. - I posted here because it's not directly related to the Radiance code,
it would be just calling the Radiance programs and scripts. It's possible to
loop in C code, but I think keeping it separate and modularized is better
practice.

Hi Dave,

This is an interesting idea.  I'm not very familiar with Python, so I'm going to ask some naive questions:

1) Can't you just invoke a system command line from Python?  Is this how you would implement these methods?

2) What are the advantages of encapsulating Radiance tools in this way?  Who do you expect will benefit?

It seems like you're just trading one syntax (the Unix command line) for another (Python objects and methods).  This can be worthwhile if the syntax is easier to use or leverages capabilities of the language in new ways.  Do you have an actual problem in mind that you think is best solved this way?  Your example gives a flavor of what you could do, but you're not really doing anything here you couldn't do by shelling out commands and stowing the results in files instead of variables.

Can you share a little more of your broader vision?  Are these just hooks for applications like Blender, or are they somehow better than the commands themselves?  Do you plan to store entire images in memory, or does Python manage variables with megabytes of data in them efficiently?

Cheers,
-Greg

Great idea. I would be very interested in a generic Python interface
for Radiance. I have used functionality of the Radiance tools in some
of my scripts and I always had to rewrite the relevant parts or use a
system command and process the output. I looked at the source code
with the intention to expose e. g. the scene parser or image
read/write in a Python API. Unfortunately I don't know enough C to do
that.

I think that a Python API can be especially useful in interactive
applications like image viewing/analysing or even a 3D GUI or scene
editor. In these cases a 1:1 implementation of the functionality is
not so important as access to the 'raw' data (pixel values in HDR
image or polygons in an octree). You can display that information or
manipulate it Python which offers plenty of 3rd party scientific
libraries to do so. The API would offer you a more pythonic/object
oriented way to do so.

That's a pity. I was hoping for a genuine Python API based on the C source code.

So far I have used the 'subprocess' module with Radiance binaries a
bit and I think there are a couple of problems with this:

1) Some csh scripts are not available on Windows. An abstract Python
wrapper should offer the same features on all platforms.

2) Short commands take a lot longer because you have to
convert/process the input and output of the commands to make them
useable in Python.

3) Long running commands do not give you more control or feedback than
the binaries do now (which is not a lot). Especially for GUIs it would
be nice to have feedback on the progress rpict or oconv makes.

4) Although I can see the elegance of your Python example compared to
a bash/csh script I think that the OO approach would limit the
functionality of the individual scripts. In that case you'd have to
fall back on shell scripting and can't benefit from the Python API.


Having said all that I'm sure I could contribute to a Python API
project. You can have a look at my take on 'subprocess'ing image
read/write here:

http://code.google.com/p/pyrat/source/browse/tags/wxfalsecolor/0.4.1/falsecolor2.py

and an OO wrapper for the HDR image here:

http://code.google.com/p/pyrat/source/browse/tags/wxfalsecolor/0.4.1/rgbeimage.py

I have also fragments of a pure Python scene parser and other bits
that might come in handy at some point.

I'll be interested in David's answer, but one reason I use Python 
scripts is that the Python subprocess module implements (relatively) 
platform-independent argument processing.  On Unix execvp() is used, 
unless a shell is specifically chosen.  On Windows, which doesn't have 
an analog of execvp(), arguments are escaped for the MS C runtime 
library.  So scripts aren't dependent on the platform.  I've used this 
and, in fact, it works.   Also, personally, I prefer working with 
Python lists to csh variables, but I doubt you would!

Well, it could be done--numpy does it, for instance.  David?

Great idea! I've got code to contribute and am interested in participating on the project.
Let's get a repository ( google code works well ) and go for it.

Hi,

I'm interested too. All packages we work on are in Python and most of them
wrapping up Radiance features.
I usually use in code subprocess, but for some things we write our own code
in Python.

For our radiance-based tool you can look on
http://deluminaelab.com/en/tools.html

Maybe discussion should be moved to Radiance-developement list?

Well, it sounds like there is significant groundswell around this idea.  I suggest that interested parties/developers organize a host site for this effort and someone (Dave?) take charge of the project.  It's not something I can personally help with, and there aren't enough spare resources or Python experts at LBNL to manage such a project as far as I know.  Ongoing maintenance is something to think about as well, as new Radiance releases will likely continue to have some minor changes and some major additions.

Best,

Since everybody is happy with a simple 'subprocess' wrapper
around the Radiance binaries there shouldn't be much ongoing
maintenance. Python 2 vs 3 is more likely to cause additional
work than the Radiance interface.

However, I can see that an additional advantage of this project
could be that the remaining CSH scripts (and possibly Perl scripts)
in the main Radiance distribution get finally pythonized. In that
case should the new scripts be kept separately or should they
find their way back into the distribution?

I think the scripts that come with the distribution have to be independent of third-party additions, especially ones that call legacy Radiance scripts back.  Otherwise, we create a dependency loop where everything has to be synchronized between separate sources for anything to work.  Such a move would require that LBNL maintain all the Python code internally, and I don't see that happening.

In general, adding functionality to Radiance through new scripts and programs is much less trouble than replacing functionality, which creates a whole host of backwards- and forwards-compatibility issues.

Wow, thanks to all who replied. I'll try to address some of the raised
eyebrows now, and answer the more technical ones later.

My goal was an easier way to do some analysis that would require more
than simple shell scripts. Or rather, a way to do some things that
would probably be easier in a higher level language. I just so happen
to do a lot in Python, and I think it's a relatively simple language
to pick up, and its syntax looks like pseudocode.

Some more complicated scripts can get hard to follow with lots of
system calls, stringing together variables, or keeping track of and
deleting temporary files. I think that a Python package could be more
user friendly by making a simple interface and taking care of that
sort of thing automatically and invisibly. Also it could take
advantage of some of the more interesting Python capabilities such as
using distributed tasks (multiprocessor/multi-machine), pre-written
data processing libraries, image libraries, etc.

Since, as has been pointed out, the same code can run essentially
unmodified on any modern system that can run Radiance, there is the
possibility that this can create an easy way to exchange ideas and
create novel approaches to analysis. The architecture scripting
community is surprisingly active.

However, all I really wanted to do initially was provide a simple
interface back to Radiance, then step back and maintain/optimize it. I
hadn't given much technical thought other than it ought to at least
start out as a wrapper program. Because of the modularity of it all,
that could be changed later. I wasn't really aiming to replace things
like the csh scripts, although this would make it easy for someone to
do so if they wanted. I wanted for it to be as transparent as possible
through to Radiance proper.

Finally, I really appreciate the volunteers. I'm not a programming
novice, but I'm certainly not a guru either. Collaboration is much
appreciated.

I've registered a Google code page (for now, Mercurial, because I've
never used it and want to learn it - I hear it's like subversion with
the benefits of git) at http://code.google.com/p/python-radiance . I
think that the conversation should be continued in the
code-development thread, where it will likely get more technical.

It sounds like what you're looking to write is an enhanced version of the 'rad' program with ability to go through multiple geometries or light conditions for batch processing and comparison purposes with the additional flexibility of file naming that would be required, and maybe automatic falsecolor generation or pcond calls, rtrace data processing routines, etc.

I think the challenge would be to make it generic enough that it is still useful for all the unique scenarios that come up, but at the same time make it worth the effort of creating and maintaining this extra interface - instead of the current M.O. of any user putting to use whichever shell or scripting package they're most comforable with. There is a danger that it makes it makes Python expertise necessary to keep up to date with the most current developments, and be able customize as needed. Although maybe there's something to be said for moving toward a common cross-platform scripting language amongst the community.

I suppose it takes a little bit of effort to try it and determine if it would fit the purpose.

PS, I write this from the perspective of someone using bash and unix commands and who has (very briefly) looked into Python several times, but could never figure out why I would want to re-write the bash shell commands I'm already familiar with into Python with all the same information just within parantheses and with the word "subprocess" before it  = )

We haven't discussed the actual nature of this package yet,
I think. My understanding was that at first it would be only
a wrapper for the Radiance binaries that would provide a
less complicated way of accessing their features from
Python.

Your idea of an enhanced 'rad' is interesting but I don't feel
that this is the main goal here. However, the Python package
should allow anyone inclined to do so to write an enhanced
'rad' without having to deal with all the gritty details of file
handling and process control.

For a start it should be very 'generic' because it only exposes
the Radiance features on a Python level. I doubt that we
can achieve all the flexibility of Radiance on a Unix shell
because that's what all the binaries are designed for. But
within a Python script you can achieve the same results
with a few more Python commands. In most cases this
will also improve the readability of the script.

Knowledge of Python will definitely be required. It's a
Python module after all. However, all of those who have
shown an interest in the project already have done some
programming in Python and I expect that we have a fair
amount of duplicated features in our common code base.

If nothing else this project could help the known Python
enthusiasts to share parts of their code.

Unfortunately even within the official distribution there
is already quite a spread of scripting languages:
Python/CSH for building
CSH for some scripts
Perl for other scripts
TCL/Tk for trad

I expect that it will always be true that on Unix you are

That's because you haven't discovered the beauty of
Python OO code yet. I agree that there is little benefit
in rewriting shell scripts in Python unless you do
something more with it (or you are not that familiar
with CSH/Bash programming).

Python has it's strength where you extend the basic
Radiance tools to a more complex application. That
could be an image manipulation app that combines
the various p-something tools or a script that automats
rendering and analysis of a scene with variations.

All:

This is an interesting idea and the excitement over supporting it is inspiring. Many of you provide a good glimpse of the possibilities with a system like this, and the path forward. I should add that at NREL we are working on an analysis platform (written in C++) for combined Radiance and EnergyPlus simulations, that provides Ruby bindings to the underlying C++ components.  I don't think it's a total duplication of this effort being discussed here, and in fact it may be more what Thomas is thinking of (more of a Radiance API).  It's very much in developmental stage, but I wanted to mention it nonetheless. Regardless, our emphasis is on open source, and cross platform tools here.

This leads me to another topic, that of a reliable Windows build environment for Radiance. As part of our efforts mentioned above, NREL is looking into getting a cmake-based cross-platform build env for Radiance and hosting it. The goal is to get a cmake dashboard setup for Radiance (nightly) builds. This would allow us to provide a repository for Windows Radiance binaries, updated nightly and monitored for breakage. Windows functionality is important to us for our tools mission, so we are currently scoping this effort. Stay tuned!

We haven't discussed the actual nature of this package yet,
I think. My understanding was that at first it would be only
a wrapper for the Radiance binaries that would provide a
less complicated way of accessing their features from
Python.

Your idea of an enhanced 'rad' is interesting but I don't feel
that this is the main goal here. However, the Python package
should allow anyone inclined to do so to write an enhanced
'rad' without having to deal with all the gritty details of file
handling and process control.

For a start it should be very 'generic' because it only exposes
the Radiance features on a Python level. I doubt that we
can achieve all the flexibility of Radiance on a Unix shell
because that's what all the binaries are designed for. But
within a Python script you can achieve the same results
with a few more Python commands. In most cases this
will also improve the readability of the script.

Knowledge of Python will definitely be required. It's a
Python module after all. However, all of those who have
shown an interest in the project already have done some
programming in Python and I expect that we have a fair
amount of duplicated features in our common code base.

If nothing else this project could help the known Python
enthusiasts to share parts of their code.

Unfortunately even within the official distribution there
is already quite a spread of scripting languages:
Python/CSH for building
CSH for some scripts
Perl for other scripts
TCL/Tk for trad

I expect that it will always be true that on Unix you are
spoiled for choice of scripting environments and on Windows
most users rely on a graphical frontend like Ecotect.

I have read various papers and posts on the net and seen the images referred to as luminance images and illuminance images.  So which is it?  Part of me says luminance as brightness is more relative to glare, on the other hand my understanding of DGP is that it measures illuminance at the eye.  Which led to me confusing myself over the type of image required.  Certainly if you try both, the results are different, however the images I am using are crude with just 1 bounce so that could easily explain the difference.

Hmmm.  Have you considered fixing up the scons scripts?  Cmake doesn't  
work on Macs worth noticing.  It has some Mac functionality, but it is  
very limited.  (At least the best book on it now only costs $60; this  
is better than a few years ago when Kitware was selling the book for  
$200.)

Hello,

My name is John and I am trying to get automatic communication between Radiance 
and other programs for my thesis.
I just discovered this group.
These archives look very useful.  Hopefully I have not been wasting my time 
working on something 
that the people here have completed already.

Has anybody figured out, for example,
how to incorporate radiance simulations into loops running in other programs?  
such as rhino, autocad, or even matlab?

Hello John,

You can control Radiance from Matlab (because Matlab can send dos
commands and Radiance can be controlled using dos commands or batch
scripts).
(I assumed you are going to use Windows.)

Here's a piece of example code for use in Matlab:

dos('oconv sky.rad result.rad > Octree.oct')
ROPT=' -dp 512 -ar 20 -ms 0.2 -ds .3 -dt .1 -dc .5 -dr 1 -st .1 -ab 3
-af RCP.amb -aa .2 -ad 400 -as 64 -av 0.01 0.01 0.01 -lr 6 -lw .002 -i
'
VIEW= ' -vtv -vp 4.800 0.200 2.200 -vd -2.300 2.400 -0.900 -vu 0 0 1
-vh 90 -vv 60 -vs 0 -vl 0 '
dos(['rpict -t 120 ', VIEW ,ROPT,' -x 64 -y 64 -ps 1 Octree.oct >
RCP_overture_5664.unf'])
dos('del RCP_overture_5664.unf')
dos(['rpict -t 120 ', VIEW,' -x 2048 -y 1536 -ps 6 -pt .08', ROPT,'
RCP.oct > RCP_c1.unf'])
dos(' pfilt -r 1 -x /2 -y /2 RCP_c1.unf > RCP_c1.pic')
dos('del RCP_c1.unf')

This might come in handy later:
In Matlab you can also use hdrread and hdrwrite commands to read and
write Radiance images.

Succes,

Guy

I think so, this is quite an advanced system for embedding Radiance into 
a simulation framework.

Still, as a general answer to how to communicate with Radiance:

Radiance closely follows the Unix philosophy of breaking up the problem 
into many small tasks, that are performed by specialized tools. So 
Radiance consists of dozens of programs, and all these talk to each 
other - or external programs. Communication happens through files (or 
pipes). More or less all data that is exchanged in between the tools can 
be ASCII text, allowing to apply all kind of filters. They can be binary 
if needed in some cases (mostly for performance reasons), the only tool 
that I am aware of always producing binary output is oconv.

So basically, you can connect anything that can handle text in- and 
output and start processes. This generic approach has e.g. made it 
possible to run simulations over clusters easily, scripting of scenes 
and processing of output.

While "Building Controls Virtual Test Bed" is a comfortable help to 
create the tool-chains, it is nothing else but adding some clever 
front-end to the chaining ability of Radiance and similar tools. Worth 
to be aware of. Another recent development is the idea to create a nice 
python-interface to Radiance, something that may be helpful if you want 
some more specific application.

Cheers, Lars.

Don't worry, it wouldn't be the first time ...

Linking an application to Radiance (for control or geometry input) is
in general a three step process:

1) export the scene geometry to Radiance (write text files)
2) control the steps necessary for the Radiance calculations (execute
system commands)
3) import the results back into your application (read text or binary files)

I expect that most advanced modelling or scientific applications
have scripting capabilities that allow you to do these three tasks.

> such as rhino, autocad, or even matlab?

Others have already written about Matlab.

For Rhino you can have a look at DIVA-for-Rhino (www.diva-for-rhino.com)
which does at least the export and control bits. I think it's focused on
Daysim but that's more or less tailored version of Radiance

Autocad has a number of scripting options. I think VBA should
allow you to script all the necessary steps. You may have a
problem with the export because Autocad does not always allow
access to polygone data that's necessary for Radiance. I am not
aware of a current project or product that exports from Autocad
to Radiance.

There are also a number of 3D modellers for which Radiance
export tools are available. Some (like Blender) are open source
so you can get all of the source code and modify it as required.

Let us know about your progress.

The Building Controls Virtual Test Bed (
http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/bcvtb) can link Radiance to various
programs for co-simulation, including MATLAB/Simulink, EnergyPlus, Modelica,
as well as to BACnet compatible building automation systems for use in
real-time operation.

All the best,

Michael

Yea I am able to use the rtrace in matlab.
If you are interested I can send you an example.
It slow though

Hi
everybody,


I?m looking
for a Radiance model of a glossy display. 
We already measured a matte display
by means of Gonio-Photometer and made the respective Radiance model (presented
in Radiance Workshop 2008). 
It would be appreciated if somebody has the angle-dependent
reflection characteristics of a glossy display which could be shared to
make a comparative simulation study of both models.

 

Cheers,

Niloofar

Message-ID: <ibs9mi$f7h$1@dough.gmane.org>

I'm simulating a test structure on a hillside site; the ground drops 
away dramatically.  So a lot of sky is visible below what would be the 
horizon on a level site.  So far as I can tell, the only way to 
simulate this correctly (if the ground reflectance and sky light is 
significant) is to give the model an actual elevation, z = 700 feet or 
whatever.  Do I have that right?

Hi Randolph,

I am not sure wether I get your answer correct. The horizon is (almost) at an infinite distance, and moving up 700m doesn't change that much. In fact, you apply your sky distribution which depends on angles, not carthesian height, to a source object to make it appear infinitely distant in Radiance.

I would try to get a good representation of the horizon line (in degrees from the ideal horizon) to assess shadowing. Reflective properties in the mountains can be interesting, too, e.g. if you have snow for a long period of the year. In general getting climate data for such an exposed location is interesting.

Cheers, Lars.

Hi Randolph,

It's a bit tricky to modify skybright.cal to account for an elevation causing the horizon to be below a 0-degree altitude, but it's possible.  First, you should check that it's necessary.  The formula you want for the angle below the horizon is:

	theta = acos(R/(h+R))

where R is the radius of the Earth (about 6360 km) and h is the distance above the horizon (sea level, presumably).  Even from the top of Mt. Everest, the change in the horizon is only about 3 degrees, assuming you could see something at sea level from there, which I'm not sure you could.  (Anyone who's been to the top of Everest, please pipe in.)

Cheers,
-Greg

Duh.  Me dumb.

It seems like a large angle when I'm looking over it...

 Hi everyone,
 
 
I'm doing a glare study with radiance and Ecotect.
 
Fristly i've created my 3d model in Ecotect, then i've exported it in radiance to calculte the lumiance in cd/m?.
No problem for this part.
 
Secondly I'm using the function findglare and then glarendx, to compute a glare index. 
When i'm writing my function findglare in my command window like this: findglare -p RCP_c3.pic > glaresult.glr
I've got en error message: "findglare: picture read error"
 
or if i'm using the method glare, i've got the same problem: "must have view or picture"
 
How can i fix it?
 
Thanks for your help,
 
Regards,
 
Alexis Loubeyre.

Are you aware of the shiny new 'evalglare'?

Is the picture a complete Radiance HDR image? Can you display
it in the Ecotect picture viewer? Have you modified the picture after
the rendering (reduced size, pcond)?

What do you get when you type the command

     getinfo RCP_c3.pic

Thomas

Hi Alexis,

How did you set up your view for RCP_c3.pic? Findglare expects a fisheye 
(180h x 180v) view. If it does not get it then it reports an 
error/warning message.

Note also there is the new program evalglare for glare analysis:

Hi Jack and Thomas,
 
Thank you for your help, I tried evalglare yesterday and he worked well.
But regarding my results have got couple of questions:
 
- i'm doing a glare study for an office (10m depth). I think glare will not be a problem for a person located at 9m away from the window, isn't it?
- when my calculation is completed, i've 2 warnings messages:
        low brightness scene
        vertical illumiance < 380 lux.
Do they impact the calcul?
So should i proceed a glare study only for the first 5m from the window?
 
How can i fix the warnings?
 
 
Regards,
 
Alex

Hi Alexis,

How did you set up your view for RCP_c3.pic? Findglare expects a fisheye (180h x 180v) view. If it does not get it then it reports an error/warning message.

Note also there is the new program evalglare for glare analysis:

 Hi everyone,
 
 
I'm doing a glare study with radiance and Ecotect.
 
Fristly i've created my 3d model in Ecotect, then i've exported it in radiance to calculte the lumiance in cd/m?.
No problem for this part.
 
Secondly I'm using the function findglare and then glarendx, to compute a glare index. 
When i'm writing my function findglare in my command window like this: findglare -p RCP_c3.pic > glaresult.glr
I've got en error message: "findglare: picture read error"
 
or if i'm using the method glare, i've got the same problem: "must have view or picture"
 
How can i fix it?
 
Thanks for your help,

Hm, that may be to easy... e.g. if your office is on the West facade and 
you directly look into the sun, it may be even worse at 9m distance...

Evalglare includes the vertical illuminance into its glare predictions, 
and (Jan can tell more about this) has been developed under conditions 
with higher vertical illuminance. So look at all the 9m, but be careful 
with those low-illuminance-locations.

> How can i fix the warnings?

No way to fix, it is a warning to catch your attention, not a bug to fix ;-)

Cheers, Lars.

If you assume a standard workplace lighting level you could
introduce artificial lighting to raise the vertical illuminance to
500 lux. Evalglare might be happier with that (or it expects far
more than that; I honestly don't know).

> Do they impact the calcul?

Evalglare has been verified in a study on a small office space.
I'm sure Jan has put some thought into the general application
for this new metric. You can find his dissertation here:

http://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/veroeffentlichungen/nach-jahrgaengen/2010/buecher-und-beitraege-zu-buechern/dayligth-glare-in-offices

> So should i proceed a glare study only for the first 5m from the?window?

I would first verify that evalglare produces reliable results
in this office space. And then just go ahead and test the
full depth of the office. If you get a low probability for glare
that's also something to show.

> How can i fix the warnings?

Nothing to fix; just make sure your using the right tool here.

Thomas

One note on the terminology, as this causes confusion often. Evalglare 
intruduces illuminance on the eye plane (if you think of a human eye as 
a flat sensor) into the calculation, which stabilizes results for 
extended, non-uniform sources (window seen from close with a lot of 
detail behind). This is referred to as vertical illuminance (as 
illuminance on a vertical plane). And completely different from the 
typically workplane illuminance, which would be referred to as 
horizontal illuminance or illuminance that a infinitely small imaginary 
horizontal surface at e.g. 0.9m heigth would receive.

Cheers, Lars.

Hi everyone
 
In radiance manual, when you want to create a glass material, we use this function:
 
void glass id
0
0
3 rtn gtn btn
 
 
where tn is the transmissivity which comes from this formula:
 
tn = (sqrt(.8402528435+.0072522239*Tn*Tn)-.9166530661)/.0036261119/Tn
 
where Tn is the transmittance.
 
For example, if i have light transmission for a window equal to 60% (given by a manufacturer), do i have to calculate tn with Tn =0.6
 
and then put my results in the function, so with this example we'll have: tn = 0.65 with Tn = 0.6?
 
void glass id
0
0
3 0.65 0.65 0.65
 
Other type, other question:
 
for a mirror, what is the default specularity if I define default mirror with this function:
 
void mirror window
0
0
3 0.965 0.965 0.965
 
Thank's a lot for your help.
 
Regards
 
Alexis

Regarding the glass definition, what you wrote makes sense although I didn't check the math.

Regarding mirror, it is fully specular - all of the 0.965 reflection in your definition below would be reflected in a purely specular manner.

That is correct. The change from transmittance to transmissivity
accounts for internal reflections in the glass. Please note that
strictly speaking this formula should be applied to a single sheet
of glass. If you want to model a double glazing unit the glass
material does not properly represent the angular dependency
of the light transmission. To accurately model this you should
use a tool like Window which allows you to export a description
of the glazing for Radiance.

The mirror material in Radiance does not represent a totally
reflecting surface as in real world. It is used to accurately represent
a reflection of a light source (like the sun) in a scene.

You can download the "Radiance Tutorial" by Axel Jacobs here:

http://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/learnix/docs.shtml

There are also a few other documents but the tutorial is a very
good start especially with regard to the command line.

Hi everyone,


Does anyone have some troubles with Ecotect 2011 and Radiance for dayllight Factor Calculation?

When i compare the dyalight factor using Ecotect v5 with radiance or Ecotect 2011 with Radiance as well, the results are completly different. Even when i'm only using Ecotect to calculate the Daylight Factor.


Regards,

Alexis

Dear Alexis,

 

Yes, the results are different and Diego and I would argue that
Ecotect-Split-Flux is wrong
(http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/research/gsdsquare/Publications/BuildingSimu

Hi everyone,


Does anyone have some troubles with Ecotect 2011 and Radiance for
dayllight Factor Calculation?

When i compare the dyalight factor using Ecotect v5 with radiance or
Ecotect 2011 with Radiance as well, the results are completly different.
Even when i'm only using Ecotect to calculate the Daylight Factor.


Regards,

Alexis

Hi Alexis,

Ecotect uses an entirely different method for calculating daylight 
factors than Radiance. If I recall correctly, it uses a split flux 
method with relatively coarse sampling. So at best this might be useful 
for a very very simple room (and perhaps even then for an initial 
approximation). Radiance on the other hand uses much more sophisticated 
methods and is capable of dealing with very complicated geometry. 
Christoph Reinhart at Harvard has done some work on this.

Regards,

-Jack

Dear All,

@ saskia:

if the results are different, which version should i trust? 

@ Kalwall:

I've got my 3d model in Ecotect, I export my model to radiance (the grid in fact) , run the calculation and display results in Ecotect.

My model is a large floor for an office, one part of this office can't receive any external lights, my room is 30 m depth with only one side (SE) with windows.
With Ecotect v5, in the back of the room i've 0.2 where with Ecotect 2011 i've 3.2 for the DF.

Alexis

None. Never 'trust' a software. Always try to understand what's going on
and why the results are as they are. If you expected something else (from
experience or from a previous test calculation) then you should get
suspicious and investigate what's different.

I'm sure you export also the geometry; otherwise you wouldn't be able
to run a Radiance calculation. Are you starting the Radiance commands
manually or is everything done 'behind' Ecotect?

When Ecotect exports to Radiance it creates a *.bat file that contains
the commands for Radiance. Can you locate this file and the other
Radiance files (*.rad and *.rif) for both exports?

>From the description of the room I'd say that 3.2% DF are way out. Even
0.6 seem quite high if the only windows are 30 meters (!) away. However,
I don't know the room reflectances or the size of the window.

When you import the DF results back into Ecotect and show them as
colour plots does the distribution seem right in both cases (bright near
the window, continuous drop to the back)? Are there any bright areas
where they shouldn't be?

Thomas

Dear Alexis,
 I would ask how tall the windows are? If the depth or your room is 30 meters and typically the depth side lighting will come into the space is 2-2.5 times the window height then you will have your answer as far as which one was more accurate. I will say it depends on the time of day/year but I am assuming you are using 12pm on the equinox for your time 3.2 DF seems high 30 meters into the space.

Dear Everyone

I've just found out my problem, it came from link for the materials. In Ecotect 2011, the path for the material folder is good but the link in radiance didn't work. I'll try to fix or will use Ecotect v5.

 So I'll continue to work on my project and be aware of my results!

Thank you for your help!

Alexis

Dear Alexis,
 I would ask how tall the windows are? If the depth or your room is 30 meters and typically the depth side lighting will come into the space is 2-2.5 times the window height then you will have your answer as far as which one was more accurate. I will say it depends on the time of day/year but I am assuming you are using 12pm on the equinox for your time 3.2 DF seems high 30 meters into the space.

My model is a large floor for an office, one part of this office can't receive any external lights, my room is 30 m depth with only one side (SE) with windows.
With Ecotect v5, in the back of the room i've 0.2 where with Ecotect 2011 i've 3.2 for the DF.

Dear Alexis,
Try putting your materials in the same folder as your ecotect file and check the look for material files
On the export tab or cut and paste them in the advanced export.

My model is a large floor for an office, one part of this office can't receive any external lights, my room is 30 m depth with only one side (SE) with windows.

Yeah Autodesk! Ecotect 5.6 could not substitute Radiance material
descriptions based on the file name (i. e. you have a material called
"wall" and Ecotect would use the description in the file "wall.rad"). If
that is indeed what's still broken in Ecotect 2011 then Autodesk did
indeed just slab on a new version number on the same old product.

BTW: I 'fixed' the problem for 5.6 by writing my own export routine
in Lua which did search for material files. Quite a bit of work, though.

Hi Roberto,

I do not think that you can do that. Here is one approach that would work:

    assume an octree of material/geometry that is to be used as an
    instance: object.oct
    NOTE this probably should be a "frozen" octree

    define: instance.rad

        void instance object
        4 object.oct -t 0 0 0
        0
        0

    then you can do one of the following:

    define: array.rad

        !xform -a 10 -t 1 0 0 -a 10 -t 0 1 0 instance.rad

    OR

    do: xform -a 10 -t 1 0 0 -a 10 -t 0 1 0 instance.rad > array.rad


Note also that you could use markers and replmarks to achieve deploying 
an instance object repeatedly.

Regards,

-Jack

The difference between a frozen octree and a "regular" octree is, that 
the frozen one contains all geometry that is only referenced by a 
regular octree. Thus if you compile a scene before running rtrace or 
rpict on it, a regular octree is fine, while, if you want to build up a 
library of octree-objects, you would probably prefer this library to be 
independent of any other files and thus use frozen octrees. Another 
advantage of frozen octrees here is that speed.

Cheers, Lars.

Hi Lucio,

Yes, instancing is a way to deploy an object multiple times for the 
relative memory price of one of the objects. We do this all the time for 
repetitive objects such as furniture or trees (for example).

It is possible to use xform or replmarks to deploy copies of geometry 
also (eg files that contain material and geometry definitions). This 
however will not result in memory saving. To get the memory saving the 
object needs to be an octree. A frozen octree is self contained whereas 
a regular (unfrozen octree) contains references to other data/files that 
must be read in at load time. I believe from an "in-memory" point of 
view (eg when running) the memory size would be the same. I think that 
one difference is that frozen octrees will load faster in addition they 
can be treated as library objects and moved around from project to 
project without having to move around a lot of other source files.

Another option from a memory saving point of view is to use mesh object 
(obj2mesh) which is another compiled representation that may even be 
more compact and can also be treated like an octree instance.

Hope that helps.

Regards,

-Jack

Subject: [Radiance-general] iso for specularity and roughness
Message-ID: <4ceed382.4a4acc0a.7cbc.0911@mx.google.com>

Dear list,

 

Hello from Greece. I am trying to find a standard for measuring specularity
or roughness for walls (plastic description), or some values that can lead
to a correct estimation/ description of these values. Is there any standard
for this description? I have read Lars mail from the 24th of June, but I
still can't configure how to find the correct value to describe correctly
these values

 

Lars mail:

 

Dear Saskia,

 

I try to help out a bit, even though I will not provide you with any such
value here. I hope that I will be able to explain why.

 

First, the term. I guess you are referring to specular reflectance, maybe
also direct transmittance. These define the fraction of light getting
reflected / transmitted directly. With a lot of simplification something
like incident angle equals outgoing angle for reflection (mirror), or light
passing straight through (glass). Be aware that the real world is not that
simple, but let us assume it is.

 

If you want to measure the specular reflectance, you typically do it
indirect. A very common approach is to use an integrating sphere with either
a photocell (if you do not need color information) or a spectrometer
connected. In a first run, you would measure the total reflectance. In the
second, you would open a small hole in the sphere so that light reflected
according to the "incident=outgoing angle"-rule would simply escape the
sphere and thus be skipped in the measurement. 

This leads to the diffuse reflectance. Substracting both would give you the
specular reflectance. For transmissive samples, the procedure works more or
less the same. Doing a direct measurement is rather complicated...
Measurements on an integrating sphere are a standard measurement.

 

The procedure seems to be straight forward. However it is not. First, you
can never measure only one outgoing direction, and you never have only one
incident direction. There is always an angular range, larger than zero.
Imagine the device for the measurement described above - there will be a
light beam used, and that is not perfectly parallel and has a diameter. And
if you open a hole in the sphere, that has more than zero mm^2 area - thus
it excludes more than one direction. In other terms, you are always talking
about solid angles.

 

The reason is not only imperfection in making measurement devices. Even a
very good mirror reflects light not only into one direction. For each
incident direction you will always get a distribution of reflected and,
sometimes, transmitted light. There are some labs offering measurement of
such distributions (maybe you have seen candela distributions for electrical
lighting - it is something like that), I have been working at one until just
recently. Using the measured data is not simple, as the data isn't. That is
why the observation that for some surfaces, there are predominant directions
where most of the light is directed to, led to the use of terms such as
specular and diffuse. We use these simplifications to be able to describe
the characteristics and, in simulation, we use these to optimize algorithms.

 

Now, for building materials, you will find very different levels of support
from manufacturers. Some will give you detailed information on reflective
and transmissive properties (go to the website of Alanod, they let you
download the bidirectional reflection distribution data of their frontside
mirrors - the distribution I describe in the paragraphe above at a high
angular resolution). Quite a lot of manufacturer of materials where lighting
is involved will give you some values like direct/specular and diffuse
(glazing, sunshades, ...) but not more. And then, a lot of manufacturers may
be able to give you color information.

 

You will also find that, depending on the application, different terms are
used when talking about reflective and transmissive characteristics. 

Gloss, shininess, application standards differ often from what is more
established in physics.

 

The conclusion is that there is no way to simply collect specularity values
of building materials. Define what you are interested in and what your
application is. If you are talking about appearance, energy transports, ...
Are you looking at facades? Glass? Paints? Different polishing techniques?

 

I hope that this helps to find a starting point...

 

Cheers, Lars.

 

Any Suggestions???

Hi,
Finally I've tried to pipe the rays from rsensor to
rtcontrib...unfortunately without any luck. I've just installed the HEAD
again but this hasn't solved my problem. No errors or messages are
generated, so I don't have any 'feeling' of what might be going wrong...Am I
missing something in my command line below?

rsensor -vf views/WattStopper.vf sensors/WattStopper_LS-290C.dat . |
rtcontrib -c 10000 -fo @rtc.opt -e MF:1 -f reinhart.cal -b rbin -o

my view file is as follows:
rvu -vtv -vp 10.86 0.84 9.025 -vd 0 -1 0 -vu 0 0 1

the sensorfile is the WattStopper_LS-290, with the exact same data as used
in SPOT. This file contains 10000 points, why I have added the -c 10000, to
obtain the average value from the traced rays as output.

Hi Anne,

I think you need to add a "-h" option to the rsensor command -- it should probably be the default, really.  Having a header in the input only messes up rtcontrib.

Yep Greg - you are so right :-)
Thanks.

Hi Anne,

I think you need to add a "-h" option to the rsensor command -- it should
probably be the default, really.  Having a header in the input only messes
up rtcontrib.

Dear all, 

I have tried to use the GenCumulativeSky.exe programme made available?through 
Diva for Rhino v1.1f.? 


When I ran the programme on a DOS command line, it said:

**
Error opening: SGP_Singapore.486980_IWEC.epw
GenCumulativeSky: Error reading climate file SGP_Singapore.486980_IWEC.epw
**

I tried it with the San Francisco .epw file as well but it also didn't work. 

Could anyone advise how it can be solved?

Also, may?I know what it means by "hourshift" in the -h entry?? 

Thanks a lot!

Cheers, 
Kam

Dear Kam,

 

This posting might be better suited for the DIVA-for-Rhino forum
(http://groups.google.com/group/diva-for-rhino) but maybe
GenCumulativeSky is also of interest to some on the general Radiance
list. The program was written by Darren Robinson and generated a
cumulative sky for annual or monthly radiation maps . There are similar
methods available by Francesco Anselmo and John Mardaljevic.

 

The program is started with:

 

GenCumulativeSky +s1 -a 45 -o 76 -m 75 -r -E -time 0 24 -date 1 1 12 31
epw_file > Gund_111.cal

 

You could try to debug your epw file from Singapore using the command
line. We are actually working on a project in Singapore right now and
the local file worked for us.

 

Christoph

Dear Christoph,

Thanks for your quick reply.??I sent it to this list?because people here are 
probably more interested in using the .exe file directly.? I'm glad that it 
catches your attention here.

Back to the question.? I have typed in the following to the DOS command line, 
and have put the weather file "SGP_Singapore.486980_IWEC.epw" in the "D:\test" 
folder.? 


D:\test> GenCumulativeSky +s2 -a 1.36667 -o 103.96667 -m 120 -E -time 0 24 -date 
1 1 12 31 SGP_Singapore.486980_IWEC.epw > sgsky.cal

It resulted in the following messages:

> Error opening: SGP_Singapore.486980_IWEC.epw
> GenCumulativeSky: Error reading climate file SGP_Singapore.486980_IWEC.epw

Could you?take a look and see whether I did anything wrong?? Thanks a?lot!

Regards, 
Kam

Dear Kam,

I just played around with the gencumulativesky.exe that ships with DIVA  
and the input for the *.epw file location is a little weird. Here is what  
I found:

A full windows directory path does not work specified with either  
backslashes or forward slashes. i.e. C:\boston.epw and C:/boston.epw both  
cause your error.

Putting the simple filename as in the example you show above also causes  
such an error.

However, there is light at the end of the tunnel! For me, putting a path  
name such as ./boston.epw works.
example: GenCumulativeSky +s1 -a 1 -o -104 -m -105 -r -E -time 0 24 -date  
1 1 12 31 ./boston.epw > example.cal

This markup is exactly what DIVA uses in its generated batch files;  
however I was not aware that conventional file location inputs would break  
the program. Just make sure that your current working directory and the  
location of the epw file are the same.

Let us know if you continue to have problems.

Best of luck,
Alstan

Dear Alstan and all, 

Thanks a lot for your quick response. It works after I add ".\" in front of the 
file name. 


May I ask a couple of follow-up questions?

Q1. I tried to generate cumulative skies for direct radiation?(binned) for 
different periods of time in a year.? They all give the same results.? Is it not 
possible to specify the time and day period for direct radiation?

Q2. I created angular fisheye views of the sky dome (180-deg spread with the 
centre at the zenith)?and found some?anomaly that I can't explain:

Direct - 

a. All sun paths are found within approx. 45 degrees from the?zenith.? It 
looks?like a?normal?sunpath diagram being "cropped", leaving a circular area in 
the middle.? I changed the view direct (-vd) and it's still the case (i.e. not a 
view setting problem)

b.?The sun paths are almost continuous rather than in form 5-degree "bins"

Diffuse -

a. The lowest row of the 145-patch sky dome is particularly?bright on the left 
and right sides (i.e. west and east sides, respectively)?.? It appears under 
both Singaporean and San Francisco skies.? Would it be related to the limitation 
on <6 degrees sun angle?? 


Thanks?in advance for bearing with this long list of question.? It would be 
great if there is a "manual" that can be made available - it's?a useful tool!

Cheers, 
Kam?

Dear Kam,

 

I think that Darren is in a better position to answer some of your
questions. This is what I can contribute.

 

Q1. I tried to generate cumulative skies for direct radiation (binned)
for different periods of time in a year.  They all give the same
results.  Is it not possible to specify the time and day period for
direct radiation?

 

I added the time periods and reading of EPW files to the program to make
it more user-friendly and compatible with DIVA.I do not think that the
binned option necessarily works with epw files (at least I have not
tested it as we have not brought that option into DIVA).

 

Q2. I created angular fisheye views of the sky dome (180-deg spread with
the centre at the zenith) and found some anomaly that I can't explain:

 

Direct - 

 

a. All sun paths are found within approx. 45 degrees from the zenith.
It looks like a normal sunpath diagram being "cropped", leaving a
circular area in the middle.  I changed the view direct (-vd) and it's
still the case (i.e. not a view setting problem)

 

I cannot explain that. Darren perhaps?

 

b. The sun paths are almost continuous rather than in form 5-degree
"bins"

 

Diffuse -

 

a. The lowest row of the 145-patch sky dome is particularly bright on
the left and right sides (i.e. west and east sides, respectively) .  It
appears under both Singaporean and San Francisco skies.  Would it be
related to the limitation on <6 degrees sun angle?  

 

We have preliminary tested GenCumultativeSky against DAYSIM and
radiation measurements from Freiburg. The paper will be submitted in two
weeks. Diego Ibarra is the main author. We can send a link of the
manuscript to this list once it is available.

 

Yes, a manual would be nice. In case you are interested in looking
deeper, I can provide the code for GenCumulativeSKy (with Darren's
consent).

 

Christoph
