Hello,

I am using desktop radiance2.0b on windows. As I need to simulate a room
with a deep lightpipe, I would like to use the photon map but I can't find
any version of it I can use on windows.

Is there anything I can do?

Hello Rob,
I have figured it out yesterday night. I tried to use Grag's compiled
version and it is working. My problem was that I was not aware that I did
not copied the compiled version to the /usr/local/bin.

I guess I also get it compiled by self, so I can share it with the list.
The probelem was that makefile can not locate GL/gl.h directory which is
probably called OpenGL on OSX after searching google. However I could get
the GL/gl.h and just copied it either to /usr/include or to unpacked
evalglare into geometry directory.

Then in "makefile" I changed
CFLAGS     = -g -DMSDOS  -DPICT_GLARE -DFLOAT=double -O3 $(DEBOPT) -Wall

to

CFLAGS     = -g -fnested-functions -DPICT_GLARE -DFLOAT=double -O3 $(DEBOPT)
-Wall

and it seems that it got program compiled. I did not tested because I think
it is better to use Grag's compiled version.

Probably there will be more correct and elegant way to do it but I guess
this is working to.

Thank you
David

Hi,

 

Although I am not sure, I don?t think there is no version available for

I think it would be worth to find out the status of the current attempts 
to update the photon map extension to the Radiance 4.x code base. I am 
not sure whether Jan or anyone else involved at Fraunhofer ISE is 
reading, but probably they are the only ones who know about the project.

First, I would immediately stop using Desktop Radiance. We are in 2011 
now, and I think the old releases are interesting mostly for historical 
reasons now.

Second, I do not know how well a patched Radiance 3.7 (the latest 
official patch of the pmap) compiles on Windows. It used to work find on 
Mac OS, but Windows is quite different from everything else. You may 
still consider to use a virtual machine (e.g. Virtualbox, available for 
free) to get a complete Linux environment on a Windows machine.

Third, as I am doing some experiments on light pipes and the pmap, I 
would really be curious whether we will have some validation data once a 
Radiance 4.x pmap is to be released. There used to be caveats which I am 
still trying to understand.

I imagine that once we have a complete pmap patch for Radiance 4.x, 
people will get it useable in cygwin & Co., too. Still, probably it 
would make sense to get your hands on a Linux installation for now. And 
using a virtual machine is the easiest way to go for people not having 
access to a native installation.

Cheers, Lars.

Hi all,

the current status of pmap is:

I have a patched version to on of the latest  head release (of December
I guess). I've already tested it and made some validations. This looks fine.
I will put it on the server soon (by end of next week or the week after).

For those of you who are using daysim: I've also tested a pmap-version
of daysim! This works in principle (I already used it for a project),
but before releasing some small issues must be fixed first. This will
need maybe another 4 weeks.

BUT: The windows compilation haven't been done or tested....


Best,

Jan

Hello Radiance users,

Christoph Reinhart asked me to give a talk at the Harvard 
University Graduate School of Design to help his students better 
understand the complexities and capabilities of Radiance. I took 
it as an opportunity to dig deep into my archives and share some 
of the tricks and techniques that I've learned over the last ~14 
years of using Radiance (and reading this list).

The talk was today, and for the benefit of his students and you, 
here are the slides and my speaking notes. I hope you can all 
learn at least a little something from this, if only what *not* 
to do.

  IEEE CGA special issue

Modeling and Rendering Material Appearance

Final submissions due: 1 July 2011
Publication date: March/April 2012

Modeling and rendering the appearance of materials is important in
many computer graphics applications. Understanding material appearance
draws on methods from diverse fields including the physics of light
interaction with material (including models of BRDF, bidirectional
reflectance distribution functions, and BSSRDF, bidirectional
subsurface scattering reflection distribution functions), human
perception of materials, and efficient data structures and algorithms.

This special issue will cover all aspects of material appearance in
graphics, ranging from theory to application. Possible topics include
(but are not limited to)

    * first-principle models for BRDF and BSSRDF;
    * procedural models of materials;
    * modeling of mesoscale material features including bumps, ridges, and
so on;
    * measurement of material appearance including BRDF, BSSRDF, and
BTF (bidirectional texture functions);
    * numerical simulation of material appearance;
    * new instruments for measuring appearance;
    * material-appearance models from photo collections;
    * new data structures for representing material appearance;
    * efficient rendering of BTF and BSSRDF;
    * new interfaces for designing material appearance;
    * methods for printing hard copies of material appearance;
    * puter modeling;
    * material-appearance applications in industry such as the design
of paints and coatings; and
    * nonphotorealistic rendering of material appearance.

Hello Mark,

Many wonderful points of inspirations  - thanks for sharing.

Question - page 11 RGB Estimate:
1) Why are you normalising to 0.9 rather than full scale of 1?
2) Why are you squaring the result?

Terrance,

Those are good questions. In lieu of actual machinery that would 
return real reflectances, I'd had to come up with a scheme that 
would get get me close. The basis of the scheme is that RGB 
screen values aren't reflectances, and they shouldn't be treated 
as such.

I'll normalize to 0.8 or 0.9 because there is no real "pure 
white" in real life. Even white paint is rarely over 0.8. And 
with models with complicated geometry, even 0.8 requires a hefty 
number of ambient bounces to balance the energy---light really 
can penetrate into some deep spaces with 0.8. Consider that with 
a reflectivity of 0.9, only 10% of the energy is killed after 
every bounce, and you'll see that -ab will need to be 
prohibitively high to get an accurate rendering. And I choose 
Radiance for its accuracy, but I haven't got all month for a 
result.

The squaring of the result is to push the values down closer to 
zero. Most of the interesting colors are in the 0.2 range, and 
that's just a hack to get closer. I am sure there's a better way, 
but that's easy to remember and quick to compute.

Mark

Your informal way is actually quite accurate. The Photoshop RGB values are
intended to be displayed on a screen with a non-linear response curve.
Radiance uses a linear color space and to convert it you have to apply a
"gamma correction" to the color components:

r = R^gamma
g = G^gamma
b = B^gamma

The typical gamma used today is 2.2. So your simple square is not that far
off.

Thomas

Message-ID: <4da15aa6.c5352b0a.5bb6.ffffdab4@mx.google.com>

Hi there..

 

Im masters student from India doing my dissertation on the topic:  analysis
of Indian traditional trellis (Jali) for daylighting

 

My question is...

1. i have done modelling in ecotect and the same im exporting to radiance
for daylighting results...

Im very new to the software... i need guidance on how to get proper views
and information regarding the model.

I also want to know hoe to map down results from radiance so for different
cases il have to compare.

 

2. i have to give the material of sandstone to my model... the whole model
material is sandstone ..but i don find sandstone as a material in ecotect.
Instead its in a layer...so what procedure i have to follow for that or is
there a method for direct application of the material. 

thanks

 

If any tutorial or anyone could guide me....

What are the metrics you want to compare? Are you looking for point-alike illuminance (as sensor readings), hours where certain criteria are met,...? Are you going with measured climate data or with come CIE skies?

It would be nice to have some samples measured using a spectrometer. As you probably only need gray levels for your application, comparing a gray chart with known reflectances to your samples should be enough. It may also be interesting to get an idea on how much reflectance varies for the sandstone found and used in the region. Probably a purely diffuse plastic material can then represent the material in your model.

Cheers, Lars.

Hi dhaRam

We do a lot of daylight simulations in Ecotect -  Radiance - Daysim for
external consultant
and personal I have done a master, the professor at the university they
don?t teach all that you need to know about
the software and the data.

You need to export the model from Eco to Radiance, and you have two options.
But before to do that you need to give in Eco the reflections value of the
material - material properties and colour.

For Sandstone i recomend to find the coeficient of reflection + the colour
of the material, is important that kind of data for the simulation.

To export is high recommend to be sure the path of radiance.
You need cameras in Eco to see the 3D inside render in radiance.

The first option to export is from CP Radiance (last window). CP open a new
control panel, be sure that the options selected in Eco are the same
in CP Radiance, and the click render. This data is very usefull to Daysim.

The other options is called Final Render, this options give the possibility
to export Rad data to Eco analysis grid.
To export the data is very simple because Eco show an alarm of new data to
export when radiance had finished.

You can download powerfull information from the page of Harvard University,
Diego Ibarra from Chile shows on PDF importants tips.

Hi,

I pointed out that it is not clear to me yet what you are actually trying to calculate. Still I would propose not to worry about color unless it is of importance in your results. Typical studies of daylight availability, glare, ... are all based on integrated units such as lux and nits (or their radiometric counterparts). For these you need reflectance, not color values.

Cheers, Lars.

Hi everyone

I need feedback or help to calculate daylight for LEED using Radiance.
Have anyone here acomplished this calculations before? I know  that I have
to use footcandles for LEED and radiance use cd/m2. I have to convert each
grid point and the scale to footcandle?

Best regards

Hi Ignacio,

You can indeed calculate the values you need for the LEED daylight credit documentation with Radiance. To be clear, Radiance by default calculates, well, radiance, in w/sr/m^2. This can be converted to luminance (cd/m^2). Now, to get the info you need for LEED, you need to tell Radiance to calculate irradiance instead of radiance, and convert that to lux or footcandles as needed. To do this you would specify the ?I (capitol i) option to rtrace, which is the Radiance tool you'd use to calculate values for a grid of points, and then multiply the rgb irradiance values by V lambda. There are plenty of examples in the list archives of little scripts and commands to send Radiance a grid of points and do these calculations and make the proper conversions to the photometric values.

Dear Jorge,

 

Our DIVA tool provides calculations in both units (www.diva-for-rhino.com).  You of course simply do the calculation in lux and then convert to foot-candles.

Hi  all...

 

Im trying to do daylight calculations and im in the starting stage of doing
this... im using ecotect for my modelling and to get daylight results im
using radiance export options...

 

I need help in 

-          What al factors to be considered while exporting to radiance....

-          What all parameters to be checked..lik materials sky conditions
etc in ecotect

-          The camera...hoe to set it accuarately

-          The best way to get ouput in radiance.

-          And how to map down the results from radiance images so tht i amy
use for comparison and calculations for various cases..

Its urgent pls help...

 

Any link to document where basics of ecotect to radiance is xplained step by
step wud also be helpful...thank youuuuuuuu

 

thanks

Hi,

Here's a helpful tutorial for using Ecotect in conjunction with DAYSIM/Radiance:
http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/research/gsdsquare/Publications/GettingStartedwithEcotectRadianceDaysim.pdf

Here's another tutorial, but it is geared specifically towards DAYSIM:
http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/obj/irc/doc/daysim-tutorial.pdf

The Ecotect square 1 website used to have quite a bit of useful
information, including how to position a camera but am not sure where
and if this information was moved after the merger with Autodesk. I
think it may have been moved here: http://wiki.naturalfrequency.com/

Usually Ecotect models are in mm. It's better to convert the units to meters
during the export. There is a conversion factor that should be set to
"0.001".

The only relevant material information is the reflectance value. To simplify
your life you can use only grey colours where the r,g,b values are identical
to the reflectance.

For a sky you probably want to chose a "CIE overcast sky". However, that
depends on your evaluations. Again, we need to know what you want to do.

Just add a camera object. It can be exported as a view specification in
Radiance. Once it is exported you can modify the specification in the
scene.rif file.

What do you want? Images or grid data? When you set up a grid it will be
exported to a "*.pts" file which can be used in Radiance. Ecotect will also
produce a "*.bat" file with the required Radiance commands.

If you want illuminance images you have to set the right option during the
export. After that you can use falsecolor.exe or wxfalsecolor (
http://pyrat.googlecode.com/files/wxfalsecolor.exe) to convert the images to
falsecolor images for comparison.

Start here:

http://wiki.naturalfrequency.com/wiki/Radiance_Daylighting_Tutorial

I think, most of the steps to export to Radiance are explained there. You
still need to have the model "built" correctly, though.

Thomas

Hi Kevin,

What you ask is a very tricky scripting operation.  If you know exactly where the point you want to calibrate is in every image, you can script it with some combination of the Radiance ra_xyze, pcompos, pvalue, and total programs.  Let's say you know that you have a value of 322 cd/m^2 in the square from (x,y)=(300,450) to (380,530) -- y pixels measured from the bottom of the image and x from the left, you could compute the average using:

	set img_val=`ra_rxyze -o capture.hdr | pcompos -x 80 -y 80 - -300 -450 | pvalue -h -H -d -pG | total -m`

You could then use this to compute a correction (calibration) factor to the image exposure:

	set meas=322
	set ecorr=`ev "179*$img_val/$meas"`

The 179 value is the standard lumens/watt conversion used in Radiance, and the 322 value is your measured luminance value.  You then need to add the above to your image header, which can be accomplished with getinfo like so:

	(getinfo < capture.hdr ; echo EXPOSURE=$ecorr ; getinfo - < capture.hdr) > calibrated.hdr

I hope this helps.

I don't know what Photosphere does, but if you have worked out your 
calibration factor like so:
http://www.jaloxa.eu/webhdr/calibrate.shtml
then you can use hdrexpo:
http://www.jaloxa.eu/resources/hdr/hdrexpo/index.shtml

Depending on how accurate you need the per-pixel luminance values, you 
might also want to look into vignetting correction, but as far as I'm 
aware, there is currently no simple cmd line approach to this. See
http://www.new-learn.info/learn/about/doc/jacobs_hdr_varna2007.pdf
for a paper on this, and
http://www.new-learn.info/learn/about/doc/pres_jacobs_hdr_varna2007.pdf
for the presentation to go with it.

Jorge,
This suggestion is not necessarily a help, and may even prove to be a

LEED or ASHRAE, you may wish to acquaint yourself with some of the er.  
peculiarities of the specification:

confess bewilderment as to what the reasoning might be.

Good luck!

Hi John,

You make a very good point, reviewing the LEED docs again it does not
clarify the "clear" sky model to use.  I have always assumed it was the
IESNA recommended clear sky definition which does give consistent and
predictable horizontal illuminance.  In my practice, I have found measured
clear skies to match up very well with these guidelines. I live in sunny
Boulder, true, but last fall we measured 32 mostly clear skies in South
Carolina which all matched up very well with the IESNA predicted horizontal
illuminance.  The luminance distributions were not far off either.

>From what I understand, IESNA Handbook 9 adopted the same clear, partly
cloudy, and cloudy luminance distributions created by Kittler and also
adopted by the CIE at the time (I believe CIE has now adopted a broader set
of 15 skies or so  covering more intermediate conditions).  In addition to
this, the IESNA handbook 9 offers a series of tables and equations for
calculating the Zenith Luminance allowing one to predict the magnitude of
these skies under different conditions.  Does the CIE not have a similar
recommendation for calculating the zenith luminance?  From what I
understand, the CIE sky models rely on input of either zenith luminance or
horizontal illuminance from weather data.

BTW - the latest public review draft of LEED 2012 goes away from this
standard clear sky and requires the user to find the average hourly values
between the clearest and cloudiest days within 15days of Sept 21 and Mar
21st.  Someone must have been listening to your concerns!

Cheers,
Zack

PS.  I have a python "IES_gensky.py" script and a "IES_skybright.cal" that
generates the IESNA sky definitions.  I have been using this solely for
"design day" daylight illuminance calculations for the past 8 years in lieu
of gensky.  It is used and available in the SPOT program.  I'd be happy to
share with anyone, e-mail me directly and I will respond with it.

Hi Zack,

Indeed, the CIE skies can be defined by diffuse horizontal illuminance  
or zenith luminance. Both options of course available in gensky.  I'm  
not too familiar with the procedures used to estimate sky type and  
magnitude since I invariably use climate data as the basis for  
defining skies.  For what it's worth, I've long believed that there  
was a 'disconnect' between what the sky model researchers were doing  
and what end-users might actually want, i.e. a means of selecting sky  
type from basic quantities in the standardised climate files.

Even if one could claim that a particular clear sky output was  
plausible, it still seems wacky to predict for a clear sky without  
sun. I've updated my commentary on this with a graphic to show just  
how much might be missing if you don't include the sun:

Perhaps, half-listening.  Averages for daylighting quantities can be a  
confounding notion, and often lead to contortions best left to people  
who enjoy doing this:

Do you have actual wording from the LEED draft?

Subject: [Radiance-general] Sources for material reflectances
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=hVeET=YqB1o-FSODzGh6xGaynog@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I was wondering whether there are any comprehensive sources with
material visible light reflectances (for a range of construction
materials)? I have come across publications that have some information
but they typically contain only a few material reflectances, rarely
more than 20 and do not go into much detail about anticipated
variations in material reflectances. I often I have to look up one
material reflectance in one source and then look for another material
in another source.

I looked through the Radiance archives and while the question of a
database has come up before, it sounds like there is no such database?
Is there at least a relatively comprehensive source one could
reference for architectural lighting analyses?

Thank you,

Krystyna

Greg- thanks - this works perfectly.  However I am also running an exposure adjustment prior to this using pfilt - to set the exposure to 1.  In this case the last cmd does not work.  Is there a way to do both corrections? 

Fyi- i also did vignetting correction w pcomb.

Hi Kevin,

Why do you think the last step is not working.  The final phase should simply add a new exposure to the existing one.  All exposure settings are multiplied together by compliant software, so this should work even if you have altered the initial exposure with pfilt.

Am I missing something?

Hi Krystyna,

Google led me straight to a little Radiance material collection at the BPS wiki site:

	http://archbps1.campus.tue.nl/bpswiki/index.php/Radiance

I wish there were more there, but the nice thing about a wiki is that everyone can contribute.  Measuring materials and getting them right in Radiance is time-consuming, and usually tackled on a per-model basis.  As an architect, I'm sure you appreciate how variable even something as basic as gray masonry blocks can be.  Even if manufacturers produced to a uniform reflectance, the material pattern and scale can vary significantly.  Nevertheless, it would be a big help to just have a comprehensive set of generic materials.

We should probably link the above in Francesco Anselmo's wiki site, which is also worth a look

	http://www.bozzograo.net/radiancewiki/doku.php?id=material_collections

Best,
-Greg

Dear List (Thomas ?)


I have been experimenting a little with getting geometry into RADIANCE by exporting to 3ds formation from 3ds Max, importing into SketchUp, and then exporting to RADIANCE using su2rad.

So far I have only tested simple models, for example a 1x1x1 meter cube, with all six faces textured with the same square image.

I export in "by color" mode, as that has been most successful thus far.

I attach a .jpg of the result. I have tried a million different things in SketchUp to try to get rid of the uv-mapping problem which is very evident in the attach render.

Any suggestions? When exporting a more complicated (sculpture) model, textured with a single "marble" albedo map, the same uv-mapping problem is experienced.

Best,
Claus

Hello Claus

Unfortunately the texture export in su2rad is not very sophisticated. It's
not a good way to produce Radiance textures anyway.

To solve your problem you can try one of the two options:

1) Select all the textured faces, right click and choose "texture -> make
unique" from the context menu. This will create six identical materials with
a uniform mapping for each face.

or 2) Use the attached script to export the cube to *.obj and then use
obj2mesh to convert the *.obj file to a Radiance mesh with textures. The
author of this OBJ exporter says it does the "make unique" step during the
export. Please note that I have not used this script myself and I don't know
if it modifies your  materials during the export.

Regards,
Thomas

Hello Thomas,

Well, I tried both your suggestions to no avail.

Then I more or less stumbled upon a "solution". If I avoid placing any part of the geometry in octants with negative coordinates then texturing works with no problems.

Have no idea why that would be the case, though.

After export I can !xform the object to any octant of the scene no problem...

Best,
Claus

This is a fairly unexpected solution. If none of the other methods worked
this seems to be more a problem with SketchUp than the scripts. Which
version of SketchUp are you using?

Hi Rob

I feel a litle lost here .... have two doubt :

- The first is how to specify Radiance calculate irradiance

I was searching  where to specify -I (the capitol i) to rtrace in Radiance
to calculate irradiance instead radiance and I found in Autodesk Ecotect
Calculation wizard - Radiance Analysis (step 10-11) the -I blank, but i dont
know what to do because is already wrote and have a blank beside. Others
command have diferents values. I?m in the right place to specify?



- My second doubt is in what place i need to  "mutiply the rgb irrandiance
values by V lambda"  I need to be in Analysis Grid Management - Edit Grid
Data in Ecotect ?

Rob I?m  really  thankful for your help.

Hi Ignacio!

It is always a bit confusing when folks think they ask about Radiance, 
but actually have questions related to Ecotect's user interface. So 
without knowing Ecotect, I try to help a bit:

> - The first is how to specify Radiance calculate irradiance

Probably the blank is because "-I" is a switch to get irradiance instead 
of radiance as output. So you do not pass any value (and thus there also 
cannot be a default). Basically rtrace -I interpretes input 
coordinates/directions as sensor locations (coordinate) and sensor view 
directions (directions). So 0 0 0 0 0 1 would be location (0,0,0) 
pointing up (0,0,1).

No idea, usually you need to weigh the RGB (unless you do everything 
with grey values) and multiply with the luminous efficacy in Radiance to 
get from radiometric to photometric units, but I have no clue where this 
is hidden in Ecotect.

Cheers, Lars.

Hi Ignacio,

As Lars pointed out, your questions at this point are more about how to get Ecotect to tell Radiance what you want to do. Hopefully some Ecotect users on the list can chime in about this?

Hi Zack,

Indeed, the CIE skies can be defined by diffuse horizontal illuminance or zenith luminance. Both options of course available in gensky.  I'm not too familiar with the procedures used to estimate sky type and magnitude since I invariably use climate data as the basis for defining skies.  For what it's worth, I've long believed that there was a 'disconnect' between what the sky model researchers were doing and what end-users might actually want, i.e. a means of selecting sky type from basic quantities in the standardised climate files.

Even if one could claim that a particular clear sky output was plausible, it still seems wacky to predict for a clear sky without sun. I've updated my commentary on this with a graphic to show just how much might be missing if you don't include the sun:

http://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm/doku.php?id=academic:daylight-compliance#daylight_leed


BTW - the latest public review draft of LEED 2012 goes away from this standard clear sky and requires the user to find the average hourly values between the clearest and cloudiest days within 15days of Sept 21 and Mar 21st. Someone must have been listening to your concerns!

Perhaps, half-listening.  Averages for daylighting quantities can be a confounding notion, and often lead to contortions best left to people who enjoy doing this:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twister_(game)

Do you have actual wording from the LEED draft?

Best

John

Hi!

Rob I visit your website and I like a lot your radiance renders!! just
perfect, I render with other programs and maxell is closer to radiance, but
radiance gives you data... more usefull.

About my LEED doubts I answer myself, because Ecotect give the options to
calculate Radiance (luminace) cd/m2 or Irradiance (illuminance) lx/m2, so,
I?m sure that we are ok with that because you choose cd/m2 option.
Now, to convert cd/m2 to cd/ft2 for LEED  I need to convert each node
values - V*0.092903 (V is the node value, and 0.09... is the value to
transform 1cd/m2 to cd/ft) in Ecotect you can do that in grid management.
I hope this informations can be usefull ... anyway, comments  are welcome to
be sure what I?m doing.

Cheers

Hi Ignacio,

What website did you visit? Because I can point you to a bunch of other websites with far nicer Radiance renderings than mine!  =)  I agree though, Radiance is nice because it gives you useful data, not just "pretty pictures".

OK, your second paragraph below is quite the unit salad. Let's sort this out as best I can, not having Ecotect to look at. You say "Ecotect give the options to calculate Radiance (luminace) cd/m2 or Irradiance (illuminance) lx/m2".  You're mixing and matching quantities here. For LEED daylighting calcs, you ultimately need illuminance. This is lumens/m^2, NOT lux/m^2.  1 Lux = 1lm/m^2. So, just make sure you are asking for illuminance.  Not irradiance, not luminance, but illuminance -- which should be in lux, or lumens/m^2. Next, you mention this node value conversion. I assume a node value is a calculation grid point. Your conversion value is correct to convert from metric units to imperial units. So, assuming you are indeed calculating illuminance, in lux (lumens/m^2), then multiplying those values by 0.0929030436 will convert the values to footcandles (lumens/m^2).

Hope this helps, I'm not really sure about any of the GUI specific questions you have because I don't use or have Ecotect.

Hi Ignacio,

As Lars pointed out, your questions at this point are more about how to get Ecotect to tell Radiance what you want to do. Hopefully some Ecotect users on the list can chime in about this?

Hi Zack,

Indeed, the CIE skies can be defined by diffuse horizontal illuminance or zenith luminance. Both options of course available in gensky.  I'm not too familiar with the procedures used to estimate sky type and magnitude since I invariably use climate data as the basis for defining skies.  For what it's worth, I've long believed that there was a 'disconnect' between what the sky model researchers were doing and what end-users might actually want, i.e. a means of selecting sky type from basic quantities in the standardised climate files.

Even if one could claim that a particular clear sky output was plausible, it still seems wacky to predict for a clear sky without sun. I've updated my commentary on this with a graphic to show just how much might be missing if you don't include the sun:

http://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm/doku.php?id=academic:daylight-compliance#daylight_leed


BTW - the latest public review draft of LEED 2012 goes away from this standard clear sky and requires the user to find the average hourly values between the clearest and cloudiest days within 15days of Sept 21 and Mar 21st. Someone must have been listening to your concerns!

Perhaps, half-listening.  Averages for daylighting quantities can be a confounding notion, and often lead to contortions best left to people who enjoy doing this:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twister_(game)

Do you have actual wording from the LEED draft?

Actually lm/ft2. You see what a mess the mixing of metric and imperial system leads to if these typos appear even in Rob's explanation.

If it was my office, the first thing I'd do is to establish a policy to only use metric units everywhere (geometry, results,...). The conversion to imperial units can be done on the fly when filling out a form.

By the way, it is rather important to understand the difference between Radiance W/m2sr and Irradiance W/m2. Going from radiometric (W aka Watts) to photometric (lm aka lumens) is just to match the human eye's perception according to wavelengths, and in many cases Radiance can internally do this on your behalf.

Cheers, Lars.

Hi Krystyna,

Google led me straight to a little Radiance material collection at the BPS wiki site:

	http://archbps1.campus.tue.nl/bpswiki/index.php/Radiance

I wish there were more there, but the nice thing about a wiki is that everyone can contribute.  Measuring materials and getting them right in Radiance is time-consuming, and usually tackled on a per-model basis.  As an architect, I'm sure you appreciate how variable even something as basic as gray masonry blocks can be.  Even if manufacturers produced to a uniform reflectance, the material pattern and scale can vary significantly.  Nevertheless, it would be a big help to just have a comprehensive set of generic materials.

We should probably link the above in Francesco Anselmo's wiki site, which is also worth a look

Best,
-Greg

in a step by step procedure for glare calculations of the model right from
ecotect to radiance export..

for ex.. what all values to be input in ecotect so that i get accurate

Dear Rob and Lars

Searching on internet I realize that I?m very lucky to be in the same mail
list with both of you. Let me show me respect and gratitude.

I still have a question in units to use for LEED calculations and I write
below some important data to remember:

* Robert told us to use for LEED :*

 Illuminance lm/m2 (lumens/m2)*
*

*Radiance web site :*

Radiance / Luminance (W/sr.m2, cd/m2)

Irradiance / Iluminance (W/m,lux)

*Ecotect options:*

Luminance Image (cd/m2)

Iluminance Image (lux/m2)    may be, must mean  lm/m2

* LEED requeriements :*

25 footcandle min

500 footcandle max



So, Rob and Lars I?m going to use *Iluminance image* Options on Ecotect to
have result in lux (lumens/m^2), then multiplying those values by
0.0929030436 will convert the grid values to footcandles (1lm/m2 = 0.09
foot-candle)    http://www.convertworld.com/en/illuminance/

LEED mentions that 75% of the zone must be between 25 and 500 footcandle, So
If I do the conversion (Lumens/m2) x (0.09)   that  value in the grid point
can be use to complete the % of area for LEED.


Lars you correct Rob about a mistake in theunits?

ROB: *?So, assuming you are indeed calculating illuminance, in lux
(lumens/m^2), then multiplying those values by 0.0929030436 will convert the
values to footcandles (lumens/m^2).?*

LARS: *Actually lm/ft2. You see what a mess the mixing of metric and
imperial system leads to if these typos appear even in Rob's explanation.***


? But the units still  footcandles right?  The confusion was that Rob meant
lumens/ ft2.



Guys?please confirm the information above is correct and have a look to the
website if you have time.


I will gladly take any comments.

Cheers!!

There are a whole bunch of people on this list that I'm thankful for knowing; it's truly a great bunch, and I have learned a lot from these people, both on- and off-list. To answer your question, yes, it sounds like the "illumimance image" option is what you want, since it gives you a result in SI illuminance units (lux) -- which you can convert to footcandles with that multiplier so that the LEED reviewers are happy. Sorry for adding confusion by botching the units in my previous post. For the record: one footcandle is equal to one lumen in a square foot!

Subject: [Radiance-general] rpict image rendering problem
Message-ID: <BANLkTinH5PhKwxKW32h1sLfCC6QtgoQ3DA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Radiance experts,

I'm testing rendering radiance scene using rpict with Radiance 4.0 in Mac OS
10.6.7

Problem A:
I'm using the following rpict command:
rpict  -vf /test/view.vf -w  -aa 0.2 -ab 3 -ad 2048 -ar 128 -as 512 -x 500
-y 500 /test/scene.oct > /Users/oat/Desktop/image.jpg

However, I have the following problem with the png file generated:
1. the surfaces not facing the sun directly looks like being burnt
2. there're a lot of black splotches along the edges and corners of the wall
3. the image has a lot of jagged edges
4. it cannot be open in photoshop but it can be previewed in Mac OS

the preview of this png file as screen-captured is like:
https://2omvuw.bay.livefilestore.com/y1p8T69Ib9EOtRETgqUwtZrJ_hfoKx1uDj4hkHKIFICcIAZ17CFilr8bRaY0n6zURTGQpmdYWRALT2rnvmiz3cUmUDR8IG_-xBd/Mac%20OS%20png.png?psid=1


Problem B:
If I render the image as .hdr file it still have the same problem 1 to 3 as
mentioned above when I preview it in Mac OS. But the hdr image can be open
in Photoshop and appears quite right with less severe splotch problem.

The rpict command:
rpict  -vf /test/view.vf -w  -aa 0.2 -ab 3 -ad 2048 -ar 128 -as 512 -x 500
-y 500 /test/scene.oct > /Users/oat/Desktop/image.hdr

The hdr image as opened in Photoshop is:
https://2omvuw.bay.livefilestore.com/y1p5J22wHNNnuKciUzj5slOchjNGAKcZ7NclFvCojDvwVmrgoglis8BQt4RB9BTaPLpbk3_3sjaJ11-TSpsM6ndEVuA5FKwZp3Y/Mac%20OS%20hdr.png?psid=1



Problem C:
if I add a ground surface into the scene, the hdr image as rendered will
have a lot of bright splotches along the bottom of the wall surfaces (the
ground surface is positioned 0.3m lower than the floor surface of the room):
https://2omvuw.bay.livefilestore.com/y1perNd2uKYSrsH2hXoIZqyVynQkw1Eid2ULgDb-gY3VJ-Cb9ANIhZ1ZucPz7rZQynAypp_Fjskp1gN9pbgNneAp7A7Hbxzwa0B/Mac%20Os%20hdr%20_with_ground.png?psid=1

The maximum dimension of the scene is around 100m after adding the ground
surface.


I'd like to ask:
1. why the png or jpg file generated using rpict in Mac OS can be previewed
but cannot be open in Photoshop?
2. why the png, jpg or hdr image generated using rpict in Mac OS looks
"burnt out" when previewed?
3. why only the hdr image file can be opened in Photoshop and appears
normal?
4. why does the additional ground surface cause the splotches? and how to
correct it?
5. how to get a clean hdr image with smooth surfaces that have no splotches
and jagged edges?
6. What are the key rpict parameters to control the image quality?


Can you kindly help to take a look and advise me the source of problem and
the solutions?

Thank you!

Ji

Hello Ji,

I won't address all of your issues, but you seem to be laboring under a basic misunderstanding regarding image file names and types.  Simply specifying a different suffix doesn't cause Radiance to write out whatever format file you choose.  Rpict and most Radiance tools that don't start with "ra_" output only to Radiance RGBE (.hdr) format.  MacOS X and Photoshop are smart enough to ignore the suffix and interpret the file correctly, though they may perform different tone-mapping operations to display them.  Hence, the differences you are seeing.

There are no converters to JPEG or PNG image formats included with Radiance.  You can get to BMP, TIFF, GIF, Targa, Pict, PPM, and PostScript.  A typical conversion might go like this:

	rpict [options] octree > result.hdr
	ra_bmp -e auto result.hdr result_tm.bmp

I have added "_tm" to the name to indicate that it has been tone-mapped.  A general tool for performing tone-mapping, which outputs to Radiance format but in a restricted range, is pcond.  A similar result to the above in PPM format may be obtained with:

	pcond result.hdr | ra_ppm > result_tm.ppm

Any other formats than those listed above will have to be reached using Photoshop, Photosphere, Preview, or other tools.  As I mentioned, they each have their own notion of tone-mapping, so your mileage may vary.

As for the splotches and so forth, there are a plethora of options that affect rendering quality, and if there is nothing wrong with your model, the use of "rad" or "trad" is highly recommended to help you set up your simulation.

Best,
-Greg

P.S.  As an interesting side-note, Unix tools do not even see the file suffix if you use redirection, i.e., "> output_file.sfx".  In the Unix tradition, none of the Radiance tools look at or enforce any particular file suffix usage, and everything is done by convention for the user's benefit.

The ambient resolution affects the image quality depending on the size of the scene relative to the size of the area of interest (for example the size of the ground plane relative to the size of an interior room). So if you have a 10m scene, and add a ground plane to make it 100m total, the -ar setting should be raised just to keep image quality the same as it was without the ground plane. If the image wasn't very smooth to start, then raising -ar even further may help.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Three-Phase Method - subdivision of window with
 sensor located close to the window
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=JxchTz8s2gM9qBD9BkkHsKEh+2A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list - Hope you have time to give me some guidance here :-)


My question is if any of you have any recommendations or thoughts on how I
should or shouldn't subdivide the window?


*Problem:*

I have a scene with a sensor located close to the window. The window is
placed in y=0.82, and the sensor is located in y=0.84, just behind the
window. Due to the sensor location this close to the window I?m thinking I
have to subdivide the window to get a correct sensor reading, especially
when solar shading is included in my simulations.



I have run simulations for 4 different cases with different subdivisions of
the window. The transmission matrix is an .xml file generated with window6
for a clear window. Nothing special here, yet! In further simulations I?ll
introduce solar shading.
My simulation results show that the sensor signal differs with the different
subdivisions.

You can see the results and subdivision of window in this link:
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9713279/ThreePhaseMethod_Subdivision.pdf

And my script if necessary, in this link:
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9713279/threephasemethod.bash

Thanks in advance,
Anne

Hi Anne,

On my computer the text on your charts show up as black squares.  But I think I can still provide some relevant advice.

Generally speaking, subdivision of the window for the three phase method is only necessary when there are nearby external obstructions or for intermediary blind positions.  But your case is unusual - your sensor point is so very close to the window.

When generating the view matrix we typically use a light material for the window.  Direct (deterministic) sampling is used to calculate the window's contribution.  The direct sampling algorithm will automatically divide a light source according to the -ds parameter, however the maximum number of divisions is limited to 64 (as determined by the variable MAXSPARTS in source.h).  Given the proximity of your sensor to the window I don't think 64 direct samples will accurately map the window's outgoing klems divisions to illuminance contribution at your sensor.  Manually subdividing the window is one approach.  Though rather than horizontal bands I'd suggest a pattern of squares that is finer near the sensor and corse away from the sensor (see ascii art below).  You also want to set -dt 0 and -dc 1.

Alternatively you could consider using ambient sampling to sample the window.  You could try using a glow material for the window and set -ad 2000 or higher.  Roughly half the initial ambient sample rays would hit the window (because your sensor is nearly against the window).  -ab can be low and -lw should be less than 1/ad, probably 1/ad^2.   I've never tried this, so I don't know how well (or if) it'll work.

If it were me, I'd give the glow material a try.  It seems much more elegant and now that I think about it, it might be a better approach for some spaces.

Good luck,
Andy

Hi Anne,

give Andy's suggestion using the glow material a try - I usually do that 
for large windows (i.e. in most cases) to avoid the
subsampling problem of the "window lights". Even if you do not put 
sensors close to the window, you mostly have walls
somewhere close to the window where the same issue arises.
Manually subdividing is only necessary - as Andy states - if it's needed 
because of changes in the exterior illumination.

Cheers,
David

Hi Anne,

I agree that you should try the glow window.  If you are using the rsensor program as your script seems to indicate, rays will be distributed over the window independently from how you've defined it.  Only the secondary bounces will care if it's a light source or a glow and whether it's subdivided, and those should not matter to the results.  This leaves the puzzle of why your output varies so much in the first place.  

Have you tried generating hemispherical fisheye views from the sensor position under the different simulation conditions?  This is always my favorite way of debugging such problems.

Best,
-Greg

Hi Anne,

Hmmm.  I didn't notice that you're using rsensor to generate rays.  Unfortunately my suggested pattern for subdividing the window is useless.  And using glow probably won't make much difference - unless your sensor has a tight and/or peaky sensitivity distribution.  Can you share information about the sensors sensitivity?  Maybe share the sensor dat file?  Also, is your sensor on the ceiling or the window head?

Andy

Thanks Greg, David and Andy for your replies.
Have run simulations with the glow material and find no significant
differences in sensor signal when having no subdivision compared to
different subdivisions. So I'll stick to the glow material for my window and
simulate without any window subdivision. Elegant ;-).

I have simply changed the window material from light to glow and set the
settings as recommended by Andy.

void glow windowlight
0
0
4 1 1 1 0

Best,
Anne

Subject: [Radiance-general] Harvard University - Executive Education Program
	on Daylighting Buildings
Message-ID: <C5E1527F129BF545A250B5AD0B0C26EF08D05975@ENTWEXMB0000000.university.harvard.edu>

Please excuse any cross postings ...

 

Dear colleagues, 

 

Some of you and/or your associates might be interested in a three day
executive education program on 'Daylighting Buildings' that we will
again be offering on July 6-8 2011 at Harvard University, Graduate
School of Design. Course participants will acquire a range of
daylighting design analysis techniques ranging from rules of thumb to
state-of-the-art computer simulations and high dynamic range photography
for glare analysis. The main simulation programs used will be Rhino
combined with our DIVA plug-in <http://www.diva-for-rhino.com/>  that
exports Rhino scenes into Radiance, Daysim, Evalglare and - starting
this summer-  EnergyPlus. Simulation outputs include:

-          Daylight factor and indoor illuminance distributions for LEED
IEQ Credit 8.1 Compliance (Radiance)

-          Annual radiation maps for urban studies

-          Climate-based metrics including daylight autonomy and useful
daylight illuminance (Radiance/Daysim)

-          Physically based scene visualizations (Radiance)

-          Glare analysis under selected sky
conditions(Radiance/Evalglare)

-          Annual glare maps (Daysim/Evalglare)

-          Thermal loads calculations (EnergyPlus and Radiance/Daysim)

 

The physical assumptions underlying these simulation programs and
performance metrics will be discussed in detail. The first two days will
consist of formal instructions, in-class discussions, hands-on software
tutorials, and exercises. Day two will start with a lecture on circadian
effects of light by Professor Stephen Lockley form the Harvard Medical
School. Participants will be given the opportunity to calibrate their
personal digital cameras to take HDR images and learn several ways of
how to quantitatively evaluate these images. During the last day,
participants will be given the opportunity to apply the newly acquired
analysis techniques to ongoing projects of their own and to go over
specific problems or simulation challenges with the instructor.

 

You can sign up for the program at
http://execed.gsd.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/exec_ed/details.cgi?offering_id=10
2042. Please direct any content-related questions to me.
Administrational/logistics questions can be answered by Ms. Margaret
Moore De Chicojay (margaret_moore_dechicojay at harvard.edu).

 

We are looking forward to welcoming some of you to Cambridge this July.
Best regards,

Hi Anne,
Just curious, how do the glow results compare to the light sources?  Could you update the graph with the sensor signals using the glow material?

If you are using the rsensor program as your script seems to indicate, rays will be distributed over the window independently from how you've defined it.  Only the secondary bounces will care if it's a light source or a glow and whether it's subdivided, and those should not matter to the results.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Three-Phase Method - subdivision of window
 with sensor located close to the window

Hi,
Maybe I was a bit fast concluding that I'll use glow. Comparing the glow
material to the light material reveals a lower sensor signal when the direct
irradiation is low and the opposite when direct irradiation is high. Do you
know why I get this? Due to the ?subsampling? problem of window lights as
David mentioned because of my sensor location very close to the window?? And
therefore I should stick to glow?

I have included the results from the glow simulations in the document:
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9713279/ThreePhaseMethod_Subdivision.pdf
(the non-readable legends and axes must be a mac thing...the same happens
when I open the documet on my mac, I can read the graphs nicely in the pdf
on my pc. ...have included some text in the captions, if you want to know
what you are looking at ;-))

And to your question about my sensor, Andy. The sensor is located on the
window head, just behind the glass. The major detection area is to the
outside through the window. The sensor used right now comes along with the
SPOT distribution, and is the WattStopper LD290C - the spatial distribution
can be seen from the image linked to below. I wouldn't call it a
narrow/peaky/tight sensitivity distribution:
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9713279/SensorSpatialResponse.png
and I have placed the .dat file here:
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9713279/WattStopper_LS-290C.dat
Why do you believe that using glow probably won't make much difference -
unless my sensor has a tight and/or peaky sensitivity distribution?


Enjoy the weekend. It is pre-summer in Denmark; we've had blue sky for the
last 14 days, 20C and sun ....who said I miss California?? ;-)

Best,
Anne

I believe this sometimes happens with PDFs produced by Office.  And, yes, legends etc. often get 'blacked out' when viewed using either Safari or Preview (similar on iOS).  However, they usually render correctly on the Mac if you open the PDFs with Adobe Reader.
