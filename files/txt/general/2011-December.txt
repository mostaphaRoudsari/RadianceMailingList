Personally, I like the cumulative approach that John has demonstrated - climate based analysis is always going to be much more informative. It would avoid the issues raised by Andy in relation to the UK 'Right to Light'/mildewed courtyard issue.

I do want to return to your calculation though. You state you have a mental picture of tracing the light from the sensor to the ceiling etc... If the metric is for houses, this seems quite an odd approach. You might do well to read about overall / average DF - perhaps starting with Joe Lynes 1979 paper: DOI: 10.1177/1477153579011002010 : A sequence for daylighting design : Lighting Research and Technology 1979 11: 10

IMHO the likely general cheerfulness (brightness) of a home, however imprecisely tested, is of more interest than the illuminance on a desk or table?

Hi Andy,

Thank you for clarification and explanation. It was so informative.

I agree that using hours of sunshine (sunlight hours) in this way totally
make sense however in the code I mentioned it was a metric for building
envelopes (e.g. two hours of sunlight hours in 21st December is needed for
residential buildings).

As you said the weakness of metrics like VSC or Daylight Factor
(SC+ERC+IRC) is not being climate-based and orientation sensitive but maybe
this is the best possible way for now.

Thanks,
Mostapha

Hi Michael,

Thank you for both emails today. I knew that statement is flawed, and I
think I mentioned that before. Nevertheless thank you for the links.

I think the best way, to find the answer, is to run series of annual
simulations for different locations. Will do soon.

I would like to model trees outside buildings in my Radiance runs. I would like to model them transmitting about 20% of light and make the canopy 40% reflective.
	* Can I do this by using a translucent material??
	* If so, can you point me to a tutorial?
	* Will this be compatible with the 3-phase method of daylighting analysis? (I.e., daylight coefficient method with the 3-phase method and a BSDF for the window).

Thanks for any help,
Tim

Hi Tim,

You can do it with trans, and it will work with the 3-phase method.  Here are some useful posts:

Dear Greg,

Does the surface roughness matter if the reflected specularity (Rs) is zero??

Thanks,
Tim

PS: Is there a Radiance beginners list? I surely belong there.
PPS: Here is my full definition.?I'm using pages 325-326 in Rendering With Radiance as my guide.

Diffuse reflectance (Rd = 40%)
Red: 25%Cr
Green: 70%Cg
Blue: 25%Cb

Reflected Specularity (Rs): 0

Surface Roughness (Sr): 0.0

Diffuse Transmissivity (Td) = 19%

Transmitted Specularity (Ts) = 1%

** Final Material **
void trans TransTreeMat
0
0
7 0.375 1.05 0.375 0 0 0.33333?0.05

Has anyone ever quantified the run-time differences between the following?
1) Creating a tree similar the pine tree Greg provides with the Radiance distribution and insert the octree into the scene multiple times.
2) Creating a tree?similar to?the Pine tree Greg provides, but insert the actual .rad definition into the scene multiple times before running oconv.
3) Creating a tree outline in 2-d and rotating it 90 degrees about the z-axis to get some tree-like effects.

Has anyone ever quantified how large the effect would be for an annual simulation to use the first or second option as compared to the third option?

Thanks for your time,
Tim

Hi Tim,

The roughness will influence any transmitted specular component as well.

Your calculation of trans parameters is off because your Rd is not 40% using RGB of 25%, 70% and 25%.  If you want 40% reflectance, you need to adjust the RGB to (0.181,0.508,0.181).  I computed these based on the Y function in "ray/src/cal/cal/xyz_rgb.cal".

With these changes, I get:

void trans TransTreeMat
0
0
7 0.272 0.761 0.272 0 0 0.33333 0.05

Does this make sense?

Hi Tim,

Short answer is that I have not calculated the run time differences for 
the scenarios you suggest (at least not in recent memory). However I 
have done lots of visualizations with LOTS of trees (using instanced 
trees).  If you have lots of trees you probably need to use instances to 
help manage scene memory. If on the other hand you are only trying to 
account for a few trees then perhaps you can get away with a relatively 
"flat" octree formation (eg using straight geometry not instancing 
frozen octrees).

Possibly pulling together this thread and your questions on trans 
materials, leaves on trees and annual simulations, I would offer a few 
thoughts though. I would suggest that having a trans material applied on 
your leaves could increase your simulation time pretty significantly 
depending on your run parameters, just think of all those trans 
calculations that are occurring as a ray is traced from one trans to 
another to another.... I would also suggest that for an annual (hourly) 
simulation this level of simulation detail is probably not that critical...

Others I am sure will offer their (greater) wisdom.

Regards,

-Jack de Valpine

Tim-

Jack is right on, as is Greg with his comment about the roughness. In an annual simulation context, I think we're talking about grid calcs and not pretty pictures (rtrace, not rpict; a bunch of points, not a view) -- the latter being too expensive. So with some experimentation you could probably create some simplified geometry or even a pattern to approximate the effect of the trees with a lower overhead (in terms of modeling time as well as computation time). 

To answer your question about a beginner's list, this radiance-general list -- in addition to the list archives -- is "open class", serving beginners and experts for over a decade. You will love it here.

Greg,

My mistake was taking the simple average, rather than the photopic average, right? I looked right past that adjective....

Thanks for catching my error,
Tim

Hi Tim,

The roughness will influence any transmitted specular component as well.

Your calculation of trans parameters is off because your Rd is not 40% using RGB of 25%, 70% and 25%.? If you want 40% reflectance, you need to adjust the RGB to (0.181,0.508,0.181).? I computed these based on the Y function in "ray/src/cal/cal/xyz_rgb.cal".

With these changes, I get:

void trans TransTreeMat
0
0
7 0.272 0.761 0.272 0 0 0.33333 0.05

Does this make sense?

I've been asked about exporting a texture from 3ds Max as a Radiance

The established way seems to be to export to OBJ with UV texture
coordinates and use obj2mesh to convert it.

Subject: [Radiance-general] changing header in images for evalglare
Message-ID: <CACxOu50vrVcG9sqqVPQt2rhHdzRZSmA-S0hdNgDE=e1FFtFPSg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

I want to use evalglare to evaluate glare in radiance images. I generated
images by three phase method, unfortunately header of those images does not
include view information, which I think that evalglare looks for
explicitly.
I have tried to change the image header just in text editor but it  did not
work and demage the image. I would like to ask how to change the header, I
know that it may be trivial but I did spend some time on it already and did
not find how to do it yet.

Thank you for all advices.
David

Use:

	getinfo < orig.hdr > modified.hdr
	# modify "modified.hdr" using favorite text editor, keeping final empty line (and no others)
	getinfo - < orig.hdr >> modified.hdr

If you're just adding a view line to the header, you could use:

	echo "VIEW= -vta -vh 180 -vv 180" > modified.hdr
	cat orig.hdr >> modified.hdr

The latter method messes up the header slightly, but should still work.

Thank you Greg, it is working.

Is there way how to include the view information in the header directly,
instead of manipulating header for each picture?

Hi David,

Similar to rtrace, on which it is based, rtcontrib has no notion of what a picture is.  The output from it is consequently lacking information you would get out of rpict or rvu for example.  There is no easy fix to this, other than scripting something to post-process the output as I suppose you are doing.

Cheers,
-Greg

Thanks.

Partly it does answer, but only partly.  I'm unclear on how the Lu and 
Lv coordinates are mapped to the mesh geometry.

Maybe I'd better do more searching in the mailing list archives.

The (Lu,Lv) coordinates are extracted and interpolated from the vertex texture ('vt') coordinates in the .OBJ file.  These are usually produced by the modeling system when the texture is applied.  You can refer to the obj2mesh man page:

Hi Randolph,

Not quite sure what you are looking for, perhaps this is a good starting 
point though:

    http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2003-October/001029.html

If I remember, Lu/Lv coordinates are mapped over a normalized space 
relating to the aspect ratio of the image being textured....

Hi,

I'm currently trying to understand what's going on behind the scenes of the radiance calculations. Can someone suggest a paper or manual which describes in detail how radiance calculates luminance / illuminance values from a given light source type and IES luminous intensity distribution file in a certain scene?

Thanks and best regards

Hi,


I'm running some daylight calculations and experimenting with mkillum.
I'm interested which light components does mkillum takes into account as
input.

I've found in RWR book on page 380 nice diagrams, but no info what is taken
into account when -ab 0 is used.

What I've understood by now:
mkillum -ab any_value:
l- option in geometry file - direct light from light sources (eg. sun) is
skipped from mkillum calculation and used later in rtrace/rpict directly.
Output geometry is made of 'illum' material
l+ option in geometry file - direct light from light sources is taken as
input and included in output light distribution. Output geometry is made of
'light' material

mkillum -ab 0:
*-which sky/sun/reflected components are taken as input for mkillum?*

mkillum -ab 1:
-direct light from sky is included
-indirect solar component (once reflected from ground or some other object)

mkillum -av 0 0 0:
-what does this give us (I know that -av should be 'ground ambient level'
from gensky?

####
To explain why do I need such strange mkillum parameters

My idea is to get light patch, coming from the sun and reflected from
specular deflector surface into the room, but to exclude all other
influences  - direct light coming from sky or sun, or reflected light from
outside/inside surfaces.
I modeled deflector as mirror with alternative metal material with
appropriate reflectance/specularity.

*I want to get completely black image with reflected light patch only, so I
can sum images from various time moments during day/year and show light
patch moving for some period of time.*

To get image with specularly reflected light only:
1. I defined sky with sun only (no diffuse sky or ground sources)
2. Calculated mkillum -ab 0 -av 0 0 0 (l+ option) for my deflector surface
3. Used mkillum output in new octree as only light source (removed sun
definition)
4. Calculated image with rpict -ab 0 -av 0 0 0
Problem is that beside direct light patch inside  the test room, I still
get some light on surfaces above/below my deflector surface.

Even when I repeat calculation for sun behind my surface (so no direct
light on surface), my output from mkillum has some small radiance, and I
get some luminance on surfaces below/above deflector.

Any ideas are welcome?

I hope I managed to explain what I want, and which method I try to use to
get results (unsuccessfully for now :( )

Thanks in advance,
Marija

To compare the effect of a new design with an existing situation you could
just create two images (before and after) and subtract the "before" image
from the "after".

Appart from that I think you should use a mirror material for your
reflector. If it's not a flat surface use a reasonable geometric
approximation. It will look different but probably will still give you the
right idea about the effect. If you are only interested in the direct
reflection of the sun (single virtual light source per mirror polygon) you
should be able to render the scene even if you have a lot of mirror
surfaces.

To eliminate the sky (direct or indirect) remove the sky and ground
definition from the sky file (you are already doing that).

If you are not set on a "black and white" footprint of the reflection you
could also use a coloured mirror (say red) and use only white/grey
materials. Your reflection will show as a red patch while direct sunlight
will still be white.

Thomas

Message-ID: <CANi9k9QpazzCACKTmB8=B+TkqKzHh1d0d52D81noCX470q7hCA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am calculating spherical illuminance(lux) or irradiance (W/m2), that is
the irradiance of a small spherical sensor in a room. I think it might be
possible if the cosine-correction process for light meter is modifiable. Do
you have any idea?

Hi Minki,

If this quantity is equal to the integral of luminance over the full sphere, then it would be the same as 4*PI times the average luminance in all directions.  You can compute the latter quantity by averaging the output of an appropriate rtrace calculation of random rays over the sphere.  Something like the following should work:

set N=10000
set orig=(0 0 0)
cnt $N | rcalc -of -e 'Dz=1-2*($1+rand(.77-.61*recno))/'$N -e 'phi=2*PI*($1+rand(-.10+.39*recno))'/$N \
		-e 'rxy=sqrt(1-Dz*Dz);Dx=rxy*cos(phi);Dy=rxy*sin(phi)' \
		-e "Ox:$orig[1];Oy:$orig[2];Oz:$orig[3]" \
		-e '$1=Ox;$2=Oy;$3=Oz;$4=Dx;$5=Dy;$6=Dz' \
	| rtrace -h -ff [options] scene.oct \
	| total -if3 -m \
	| rcalc -e '$1=179*4*PI*($1*.265+$2*.670+$3*.065)'

This should take ray samples in a stratified random spiral over the sphere.  The 3 averaged radiance values (RGB) output should be multiplied by 179 and 4*PI as above, unless I misunderstand the definition of spherical illuminance. 

Best,
-Greg

First thing that I've tried when started working on this problem is
subtraction of images 'before' and 'after'. It gave me nice light patch,
but also some other bright pixels on the edges of the area where direct sun
patch was - because of randomness of Radiance calculation (I suppose) .

 Surface is flat so I've put mirror, and I removed sky/ground.
Problem is how to get rid of the direct sun and keep reflected one.

I tried rtcontrib but all contribution go to the sun. Thats why I'm using
mkillum to make my mirror deflector separate light source (with l+ option).
After that I get nice light patch from deflector, but also some light
around (which shouldn't be the case since I use -ab 0 -av 0 0 0).

Yes good idea, I've tried it also and it works - so If I don't find some
way to do it nicely in black-white, I'll go to solution.

Thanks again,

Hi John,

Thanks for posting this erratum, it explains why my images with mkillum -ab
0 and rpict -ab 0 seem illogical to me :)

I'll print it and include in my book  - to be sure I remember that for the
next time I have similar calcs.

Thanks again,

Hi Randolph and Christoph,

thanks for your feedback.

I have the "Rendering with Radiance" book and also read a lot of tutorials and have a understanding of how to render with radiance, but a lot of the important stuff is fragmented within several places.

I was just wondering if there were a short overview (with graphics) which describes in detail what is going in detail, but it seems like I have to digg deeper and sort the puzzle...

Best regards
Jan

Try my thesis at

- I covered some of the ground there.  After that, the code and this 
list is the resource.

I'm going on vacation, and won't be answering questions for a week or 
so, but will do so afterwards.

Subject: [Radiance-general] calculating number of daylight hours
Message-ID: <9B624A5B54E1F848B4177AECC079C858379E1B@SG-EXCHMB1.smithgroup.com>

Happy holidays list!

I am trying to calculate the number of daylight-hours falling on a surface from a series of images in a batch file. I have an image created using -ab 0 and want to convert it into an image that shows a value of 1 for areas receiving direct sun or value of 0 for areas that do not.
I feel like pvalue is what I need to do this. I am following this thread with limited success (http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2009-January/005723.html). When I try to modify for my task, I am having trouble getting the desired result.

pvalue -d -h -H input.pic | rcalc -e '$1=if(179*$1-100,1,0)'  gives an expected result of either a 0 or 1 depending on if the value is above or below the desired threshold.
If I then pipe the result back into pvalue I get a "pvalue: read error" and no image:
pvalue -d -h -H input.pic | rcalc -e '$1=if(179*$1-100,1,0)'  | pvalue -r -H -h -d -y 693 +x 1200 > output.pic
Do I need to format the input values differently?

I was also able to somewhat successfully use pcomb to strip the original image into a black and white image using the same "if" condition on lo=, but there was no value associated with the pixels.
Ultimately, I would like to take a series of images and pcomb them in order to make a falsecolor display of sunlight hours in a space/on a surface. I realize it may be easier to calculate with rtrace and then display my results that way, but this was my first thought.

Thanks in advance for any assistance. I'm open to any suggestions you might have.

Hi Chris!

> pvalue ?d ?h ?H input.pic | rcalc ?e ?$1=if(179*$1-100,1,0)?  | pvalue
> ?r ?H ?h ?d ?y 693 +x 1200 > output.pic

I could not dig deeper into the topic now or try it, but my guess is
that (unless something magic is going on) pvalue -r expects pixel values
for more then one channel. You are only passing the first channel ($1 in
the rcalc expression).

If you use only the first channel ("R") in your simulations to record
results of the -ab 0 calculation, you can ignore the other two channels
("B", "G") and zero them in the output:

pvalue ?d ?h ?H input.hdr | rcalc ?e ?$1=if(179*$1-100,1,0); $2=0; $3=0?
| pvalue ?r ?H ?h ?d ?y 693 +x 1200 > output.hdr

Sorry, I could not resist but change the file extensions from pic to hdr
:-) So while I am not sure whether this solves the problem, it may hint
you to the error.

Cheers, Lars.

Lars,

Thank you for the response. I thought I had tried that in another test (which I had). Just tinkering around and looking at the original data, I realized that I had at some point switched on the -u option of pvalue to list only the unique values. Once I realized that, my full command line works! I'm sure that switching from a pic extension to hdr helped as well ;)
I also realized that I would need to divide my 1's by 179 again to get back to the desired units in my images.

Thanks for the help! Hopefully I don't make any more mistakes when I wrap this into my script to generate the data.

Chris

Dear colleagues,

This is a short l note that I will be moving with parts of my group from Harvard to the Building Technology Program at MIT starting January 2012. I will be expanding my research focus to the awakening field of urban energy modeling, working on a coherent theory and toolset for architects, urban planners and policymakers. We have started this process last term in a class in which we developed a new Rhino based tool that calculates operational energy use for multiple buildings using E+ along with scripts to calculate walkscore and urban daylight availability distributions. I will be sharing links to the tool as well as selected student projects in late January.

There is a lot of work to be done so, if you know any creative minds interested in doing graduate work at the interface between design and building science, please make them aware of our program.

Warm regards and season's greetings,

Christoph
