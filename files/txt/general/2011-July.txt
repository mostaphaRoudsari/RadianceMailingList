Hello

I need to make the conversion of Luminance values (cd/m2) to the RGB colors to write-in Radiance...

Can anyone give me a hint of this basic question?

Thanks in advance.

Hi, Steph,

Not sure if it's helpful but please refer to Axel Jacob's tutorial in page
40 (
http://www.jaloxa.eu/resources/radiance/documentation/docs/radiance_cookbook.pdf
).

According to Axel, the illuminance value (lux) of a point is calculated by
using the following formula:
Illuminance = 179*(R_irradiance*.265 + G_irradiance*.67 + B_irradiance*.065)


I'm not sure if a Luminance value can be converted and split back into RGB
radiance values.

So, maybe the experts here can give you more clearer advices.

- Cheers, Ji

Hi,

 

Can anyone recommend any literature/study regarding setting up optimum
ambient bounce (AB) parameters for spaces based on the accuracy of the
results compared to the degree of its complexity/ floor plate sizes/
time taken to finish a rendering etc?

We are doing a study comparing a single space with the following
daylighting strategies using both Radiance and Daysim:

a) Simple fenestration with only low e glazing (single/double/ triple
insulated glazing etc)

b) Fenestration with blinds (manual/automated)

c) Light shelves

d) Combination of all of the above.

 

Any help/recommendations in this regard shall be highly appreciated.

 

Thanks,

Judhajit.

Yes, you basically invert this formula.  If you have no color information, you can get a grayscale result by dividing your luminance by 179 and using the result for all three (RGB) channels.  The pvalue program can produce a Radiance picture from raw input values, and the -b option can be used together with -r to take in a single radiance value for each pixel.

Judhajit,

Have a look at sections 3.3.1 and 3.3.2 of John Mardaljevic's thesis.
http://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm/doku.php?id=resources:thesis

Also, John is presenting a Seminar on the Radiance Ambient calculation at the Radiance workshop in August.  I'd suggest you consider attending since it is only across the bay from your office (workshop info: radiance.lbl.gov).

Hi Randolph,

This shouldn't happen, unless one of the rpict processes died unexpectedly.  Even then, I would expect some other kind of error to be reported as well.

Thanks, Greg.  I think that's what happenned; in fact seven of the 
eight died in two cases.  Wierdly, the third succeeded.  If I run it as 
a single-processor job, it works.  Here's a piece of the log:

Hi Judhajit!

In addition to previous replies, I would recommend these two:

1) study how rad is setting the ambient settings based on the 
information given in the rif-file - it is usually quite successful doing 
so. Code is open source...

2) Mark Stock did a lot of experimentation, especially focusing on 
scenes with large amounts of geometry objects which tend to stretch the 
ambient cache's efficiency. He was especially interested in rendering 
times and the visual appearance, still a great documentation by Mark at

http://markjstock.org/radmisc/aa0_ps1_test/final.html

Besides that - it is good practice to do some work on finding out when 
you settings lead to "stable" results. So for each scene type, it may be 
wise to vary ambient settings from "high performance" to "high accuracy" 
for different ambient bounces (-ab), at least once for sunny and once 
for cloudy skies. You can do so e.g. by rendering illuminance on the 
floor plane one pixel wide perpendicular to the facade. Plot the 
results, and you will find

a) at which number of ambient bounces increasing -ab does not lead to 
significant increase in recorded illuminance

b) at which "accuracy" you get a reasonable (usually rather smooth) plot 
- very low accuracy tends to give a lot of spikes in such a plot, even 
if the average may be acceptable

Having these tests done will probably give you a much better feeling 
about the parameters in your rpict/rtrace command line and should be 
kept with the results :-)

Cheers, Lars.

Message-ID: <CAO0Bi3Vq5wb5b8P4rLYSwj4akU_3wC726UhJSWXtus+3=Gc_kg@mail.gmail.com>

I hope I'm not interrupting the sense of the discussion, but I kind of have
the same question: when is about the properties
of materials (RGB plus roughness and specularity). If I want to simulate an
existing material in Radiance I need to
decompose it in the 3 primary colours.

As I understand Radiance uses Hemispherical Reflectance (ratio of flux
leaving the surface to the incident flux). I have this
data from the site...but how to get it to RGB in the case that I dont have
an spectrophotometer to measure. One way I know
could be using a grey scale chart, but then I also need to know under which
light source were those reflectances calculated
in order to compare them to my luminances. The objective of all this is to
obtain illuminance calculations.

Sorry again for the interruption...hope anybody has an answer.

Thanks in advance.

Hi Chantal,

it would be great of we could point you to the book "Rendering with 
Radiance", which has a chapter on material data aquisition. 
Unfortunately it has been unavailable for a while, and you need a lot of 
luck to find an old copy in some library. Maybe you still try.

You question was not 100% clear to me as what data you have:

> of materials (RGB plus roughness and specularity). If I want to simulate

You need that ONLY if you are interested in color in your simulation 
results, too. Photometric units are typically not aware of color 
(luminance, illuminance) as they are the weighted integral over the 
perceived wavelength range of light.

You should compare your grey chart with the sample under daylight or 
incadescent lighting condition. As long as you have a continous source 
spectrum, the grey chart should(!) perform rather stable, and unless you 
use a green LED to lid your sample :-) you should get acceptable 
results. Keep in mind that the idea is not to get reflectance data in 
high accuracy ranges, but to find out whether your wall is bouncing back 
light more like 30 or more like 60% here...

You should take a grey chart with you. In many cases, there is measured 
data available by manufacturers, so it is always a good idea to take 
your notebook and write down any material/product information on site. 
One other way is to try using calibrated photographs (there is a tool 
called macbethcal coming with Radiance) if you have a color chart. This 
is useful if you need color and not just integrated reflectance. Still 
take the chart and write down a rough guess of the reflectance and 
compare to what you get from your calibration efforts.

The objective of all this is
> to obtain illuminance calculations.

Again - for this, you typically need no color information, just 
reflectance - all surfaces will be grey, all sources white.

Cheers, Lars.

Just a head's up -- we are close to finally having print copies of the 1998(!) book available again, hopefully in time for people to order in advance of this year's workshop.  Randolph Fritz has been working tirelessly on getting the PDF in shape for printing again, and has most of the short-run printing details worked out.  We're just sorting a few details before soliciting orders.

Of course, we've promised this sort of thing before, but this time it looks like it's really going to happen.

Best,

P.S.  Colors may interact to give you different results than if you had used equivalent grays everywhere, but if you don't have color measurements or at least photographs, it's difficult to come up with good estimates of what the color should be.  See the link:

Dear List, 

I was trying to simulate the visual appearance of brushed alluminum, but
I am struggling with the roughness of the materials.

I am using metal and metal2 at different roughness settings, but I
always seem to get a pattern in the roughness of the material, I was
wondering if any other rpict parameters affect the material behaviour.

My current suspects are:

-ad   Set the number of ambient divisions to N
-as   Set  the number of ambient super-samples to N
-ms	Set the medium sampling distance to sampdist

does anybody has some insight in this?
Thanks,

Giovanni

Hi Giovanni,

Set "-u+" to turn on random Monte Carlo sampling if the pattern bothers you.   You'll get a noisier image, but without the brushed look of the low discrepancy sequence rpict normally uses.

Hi Giovanni,

I think that what you need to look at is actually specular jitter and 
threshold (-sj and -st), -ms is for something unrelated assuming I 
remember correctly.

Another factor that can contribute to the appearance of a "pattern" 
(sort of striated) in material with specular and roughness components is 
that fact that Radiance use pseudo random sampling. One way to make this 
go away (albeit at some expense in terms of compute time as well as 
requiring higher image oversampling) is to use the -u switch for 
uncorrelated monte carlo sampling.

Best,

-Jack

That's exciting news! The other day someone borrowed my sed/awk book without telling me, and while that was no big deal, if someone borrowed my RwR book without telling me I would have mounted a massive search, and once discovered, the borrower would never borrow from me again. I still have the Amazon receipt from my original purchase of this text. It's one of a very few books in my library that I consider irreplaceable, so It's nice to hear that print copies will be available once again!

Thank you all for taking time to answer my questions...actually your reply
is really helping me to put things into context.

*A fast reply:*
The data I have is only luminance (cd/m2), from walls, ceiling and floor of
a real room. The intention is to simulate
that room in Radiance, and one of those walls in reality is orangish so in
this case color might matters as the reflectance
of the material will affect the lighting environment in the room. The aim is
obtaining illuminance levels in simulation
closer to reality (measurements I already took).

As far as I know, in order to describe the materials in a virtual model,
Radiance takes 3 values which correspond to RGB. This
is my question...how to reproduce real material properties in Radiance
(closest to reality).

I'll have a look to the method using the grey scale chart and using the
Macbeth ColorChecker Chart as you mentioned.
I highly appreciate that you pointed me in this direction...

But I'm pretty sure that I'll be here around with more questions in the near
future.  :)

Thanks again!

Best Regards.

Hi Chantal!

Please note that Radiance expects reflectance. Luminance is not a 
"material property" (except for light sources), but the result of a 
certrain amount of light leaving a surface of given 
reflectance/transmittance at a certain direction. The approach with grey 
charts relies on the assumption that both the patch of known reflectance 
and the sample are lid by the same source under very similar directions, 
and that both samples are also seen under almost identical directions. 
So if you know luminance for a patch of 0.4 reflectance and luminance 
for a patch of 0.2 reflectance, you can make an estimate on the 
reflectance of a patch that appears with a luminance between the two. 
Both the camera and your eye just record that luminance, so you must 
"see" a known reference at the same time to make guesses on the reflectance.

Cheers, Lars.

Message-ID: <CABzgtwqY3g7LbFrnMOs9x2aYycKR1-aYRHwwA_MhRNU=PB2QCw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello experts:

If using -m option in rtcontrib, can I calculate the contribution from a
general object that does not belong to light source, such as objects having
plastic materials?

My model has two windows, and I want to calculate the contribution of each
window to the illuminance at sensor points. The "Three-Phase Daylight
Coefficient" method works. But for simple windows, can I directly calculate
the contribution using rtcontrib or others?   Any suggestion is greatly
appreciated.

Thank you!

"Yes" is the short answer.  Using the rtcontrib -V+ option, you will get the contribution from each surface or set of surfaces selected by -m.

Thank you! I have other questions related to this program.

(1) Question 1:

In the case that both of "-f", "-b" and "-m" are used, the .cal algorithm
and "-b" option are applied to objects with "-m" materials, for example,

vwrays -ff $vw |rtcontrib @image.opt -ffc $(vwrays -d $vw) -f tregenza.cal
-b tbin -o images/patches/p%03d%s.hdr \
-m sky_glow -m ground_glow -w testroom_whitesky.oct

If I replace "ground_glow" with "ceiling_mat", the .cal will applied to
"ceiling" geometry and divide ceiling into many patches according to the ray
direction and intersection with ceiling?

(2) Question 2:

Assume my model has two windows in the south wall and one sensor in the
interior building, and I wish to calculate the daylighting coefficient of
each patch of sky and each window to the illuminance at the sensor point.
The result is like a matrix as follows:

                    SkyPatch001,       SkyPatch001,
Window01     coefficient (RGB)   coefficient (RGB)
Window02     coefficient (RGB)   coefficient (RGB)

Each coefficient shows the contribution of each sky patch and each window to
the sensor illuminance. Can I achieve this in one rtcontrib command?
Is the following expression right?

[input ray] | rtcontrib -f tregenza.cal -o window_%s.data -b tbin -m
window01_mat -b -b tbin -m window02_mat  [other necessary options]

Thank you,

Jia

Yes, the bins will still be based on ray direction due to the "tbin" definition in "tregenza.cal", but will apply to rays striking surfaces using "ceiling_mat" instead of "ground_glow".  The intersection position on the ceiling will not affect "tbin" since it doesn't use this information, so the same direction at one corner of the ceiling will go to the same bin as a ray hitting the opposite corner in that direction.

You don't need to give the "-b tbin" option twice, and the "-b" option by itself will generate an error, but otherwise it is OK.  Note that this command neglects any exterior obstructions that might interfere with the travel of a sample ray from the exterior of the window to the sky.  If your building has external shades or obstructions outside, the above technique will not produce accurate results.

The general ability to choose combined interactions in rtcontrib is lacking.  E.g., you can't ask for all rays that pass through "window1" then go on to intersect "building2" and reflect to "skypatch17".  It would be a useful feature to add, but such accounting is problematic.

Best,
-Greg

Subject: [Radiance-general] actual radiance value
Message-ID: <CABzgtwq7Jf=pRQz_Bd=EuH27LbOqJLo2aMjk-sRQ9AD8L8Xbaw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello experts:

Is the following understanding of "radiance" in the Radiance program
correct?

If I input irradiance (W/m2) values in Gendaylit, the inputted irrdadiance
values will be converted to zenith luminance (cd/m2) according to Perez's
model (1990), then luminance will be converted to "radiance" (W/m2*sr) value
in the visible range by dividing 179 (I did not see "179" in the
gendaylit.c).

So, the irradiance value calculated by the Radiance program should be
different from irradiance value in weather file even though the actual
irradiance values in the weather file are used as an input of
gendaylit (assuming Perez's model is perfect). But the illuminance /
luminance values calculated by Radiance should be accurate in theory (also
assuming Perez's model is accurate).

PS, my school library does not have permission to access the full text of
the Perez's paper (1993) referred to by Gendaylit program (url:
http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0038092X9390017I).  If
allowable, could someone send me this paper?

Thank you,

Jia

Subject: [Radiance-general] [help] how to get short-wave and long-wave solar
	radiation value?
Message-ID: <CAD83LVKsL0OQfBDdkpifgm2y=cjcamZQurtBDskY1aNf0wdrJQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Radiance experts,

May I ask whether it's possible to "isolate" the contribution of short-wave
and long-wave solar radiation using Radiance?

One of our colleagues wants to get these values for the calculation of "mean
radiant temperature" for the purpose of analyzing the implications of urban
geometries on thermal comfort.

Correct me if I'm wrong, the irradiation value obtained in Radiance is the
total solar radiation energy received on a given surface.

So, is this "total" value encompasses the full spectrum of solar radiation,
including the visible part and the short-wave and long-wave parts that are
not visible to human eyes?

If it is, then, is there a way to single out the contribution from
short-wave and long-wave radiation separately?

Clarification and advices are deeply appreciated!

- Cheers, Ji

Hi Ji,

(1) Solar gain generally belongs to shortwave (only a small range of
longwave, near-IR). IR needs to be calculated separately.

(2) Radiance calculates radiance within visible range, not full spectrum.
But Gendaylit could output full range spectrum (more precisely, UV, visible,
and near-IR) and then you can convert the radiance back to total
irradiance.

But some issues exist and should be considered if accurate results are
required: (a) calculation of energy needs considering absorbed gain,
currently, as far as I know it is difficult to calculate absorbed energy in
Radiance. (b) visible transmittance and solar transmittance is generally
different.  Some glazing, for example, may be spectrally selective. (c)
Sunlight entering into the building may be reflected back. (d) For window,
divider, frame and reveal needs to be considered in energy calculation (e)
Center-of-glazing and edge glazing have different energy performance, This
should also be considered.

(3) For calculation of solar gain, sky needs to be simulated, building
simulation software such as E+ and Radiance uses different algorithms. (a)
gendaylit uses Sky Luminous Model which is developed by Perez (1990); (b) E+
also uses Perez's model in the same paper, but this model is specifically
for calculating irradiance on tilted surface. Since the original purpose of
developing sky luminous model by Perez is to calculate luminance/illuminance
to deal with the daylighting (visible) issue, so it may be better to
consider using Perez's another model to calculate irradiance.

Hope this helps,

Jia

You are (almost) completely free to choose what wavelength range to 
squeeze into any of the three channels that we usually refer to as RGB. 
So instead of calling the first channel "RED", you could call it 
"Shortwave". As long as you use the three channels for the same 
wavelength ranges when defining materials, sources, and interpreting 
results, that is fine for radiative transfer of energy.

However I would advice not to make use of the possibility of rendering 
all these wavelength ranges at once by making use of the three channels. 
It would be better to set all three channels to the same wavelength 
range, so work with "neutral grey" lights and surfaces. The reason is 
that there are some (few) parts of Radiance's code where the channels 
are weighted according to human perceiption assuming RGB-like wavelengths.

Another question is how to find how much of the absorped short-wave 
solar irradiation may get emitted as long-wave radiation by a surface. 
Radiance does not consider such "shift" effects. So IR radiation by 
surfaces heating up in the sun would not be reflected.

Cheers, Lars.

Dear RADIANCE experts,

I'm Julitta. Postgraduate students. Need your help on installing RADIANCE into my laptop. I'm using MacBook Mac OS X 10.6.7. 

Read and follow instruction from RAdsite lbnl website and various forum and other websites showing instruction on installing the software. Unfortunately i'm lost and totally black out. 

Honestly I do not know where to start, such as... where to type a command... Have tried XAMPP command as suggested but failed to execute or unzip the mentioned files/folder. 

I've done the very first part of downloading the rad4R0all.tar.gz. (is it as simple as clicking the address, then it goes to your "downloads" folder, then double click, so from rad4r0_macosx-1.tar turn to a folder of rad4R0_macosx). Then? How to unpack or to be specific where to type this unzip<rad4roall.tar.gz....... 

Thank you,

Hi Julitta,

I am very short on time right now, but under applications/utilities you 
should find an application called X11. If you start it, you get a window 
with a command line waiting for input. That is what folks here usually 
call command line or shell. And this is where you input all those 
commands that are usually referenced.

Hope this helps for the beginning. You do not need XAMP (which should 
mean OSX, Apache, MySQL and PHP) - delete it right now :-)

Cheers, Lars.

Welcome Julitta.

Radiance is a bit tricky to install because it used to be an old fashioned
source only distribution. To install it you had to have a C-compiler
installed (and you had to know how to use it). Things are a bit easier these
days but you still need to change a lot of system related settings on a Mac
to get it running.

Yes, these instructions are for the source code installation. For the most
part you can ignore these.

XAMPP has nothing to do with Radiance. Forget about it.

This is the source code that needs to be compiled first. You should download
the following package:

http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/dist/rad4R0_macosx.tar.gz

It contains binaries which can be executed immediately. Unpack the archive
("double click") until you can browse the contents in Finder.

To "install" the programs pick a folder called "Radiance" in your own
"Library" folder or in the "Applications" folder. Copy the "bin" folder from
the downloaded archive into the "Radiance" folder.

Now download the "auxiliary files" archive
http://www.radiance-online.org/software/non-cvs/rad4R0supp.tar.gz and unpack
it. Copy the "lib" folder in this archive into the "Radiance" folder as
well.


Now you have to set environment variables which allow your Terminal shell to
find the binaries and supporting files. Open TextEdit.app and type (or copy
and paste) the following content:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "
http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
<key>PATH</key>
<string>/Users/julitta/Library/Radiance/bin</string>
<key>RAYPATH</key>
        <string>/Users/julitta/Library/Radiance/lib</string>
</dict>
</plist>

If your home directory is not called "julitta" or you have chosen the
"Applications" folder adjust the paths in the file accordingly. Make sure it
is a "plain text" document (shift-cmd-T) and save it as "environment.plist"
in your home directory. There is no ".txt" after the ".plist"!

Open the Terminal.app application (in "Applications/Utilities"). You should
keep this app in the dock because it is you primary interface for Radiance.
Type the following two commands:

mkdir .MacOSX
mv environment.plist .MacOSX

Now close Terminal.app and right-click on the Dock icon and select "quit".
The white dot below the icon has to vanish. Open Terminal.app again (I told
you to keep in in the Dock ...).

Now type

echo $PATH
which rtrace

Each of these commands should show you a path that contains your Radiance
installation directory.

I hope others will jump in and explain how to use Radiance because I have to
go to work now.

Regards,
Thomas

Which version of Python are you on? It should be something in the low 2.x
range (I think it was written for 2.3). 3.x will most likely cause problems.

As the error message states, see  PEP 263:
   http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0263/

The encoding declaration specified there needs to go into the
file(s) failing to load.
Figuring out the actual encoding will be another challenge.
The value \xe8 may appear in several encodings.

Wow, Thomas -- those are great directions for OSX.  I learned a new trick from them, myself.  I had nevr seen the plist stuff for Terminal.app.

I just wanted to add a note that Julitta may need to install the X11 and Developer Tools from the optional packages on her installation disks.  The system doesn't come with them installed by default.

Apparently it's only useful for Terminal.app. Applications that are started
via Finder (or the Dock) do not get this information. If you have a tool you
can use to verify this (a proper OS X *.app with some form of command line)
you can try and set a few environment variables and see if they are present
in the app.

I have to confess that I had to google for the the right place as well. All
my shell config files didn't contain the $PATH extension for Radiance so I
had to look somewhere else. I remembered the *.plist from way back when I
set up my first Mac. I must have done it again after I upgraded to 10.6,
though. I have my binaries in /usr/local and have no need for RAYPATH, but I
didn't want to expose Julitta to the file system innards of OS X.

I think X is standard now (since 10.5 or 10.6) and the dev tools shouldn't
be required.

I usually put something in my .cshrc file, or .profile for Bourne shells, and let that take care of it.

There are some example directories and so forth that require "make", which is part of the developer tools.  That's usually the first thing new users run up against.

Lars, the code is an e-accent-grave in the ISO 8859-1 character set.  
Current versions of Python can be made to accept that character set by 
adding a comment containing "coding=latin-1" in the first two lines of 
the module file.

This could be one of the following lines:
  # coding=latin-1
  # -*- coding: latin-1 -*- (for Emacs)
  # vim: set fileencoding=latin-1 : (for vim)

Hope this helps!

Francesco, if you're reading, could you pick up this change?

Hi!

I hope I do not bother folks not interested in Blender, as this is a 
rather specific problem of a tool developed for supporting Radiance, not 
a problem related to Radiance itself.

Thomas, I am using python 2.7.1 coming with my current Ubuntu, and tried 
various 2.4-2.5 releases of Blender.

Randolph, Georg, I added a line reading

# coding=latin-1

to the beginning of the file.

Still, I get a "mismatch in assignment". The full output of the Blender 
2.49 session is:

Buffers are used when communicating between Python code and
extensions written in C. That probable means you are seeing a bug
in some Python code, which is using the Blender API incorrectly.
That bug could be in a file coming with Blender (eg. BaseWindowClass.py)
or in a file coming with brad. Hard to tell without a detailed
analysis of the interaction between the two.

It is also possible that the added coding specification resulted in
some API function receiving an Unicode string now instead of a byte
array (traditional text string).

In either case, the author of brad would be in the best position to
identify and fix the problem.

Dear Mr Lars, Mr Greg, others,
 
Thank you very much.


Dear Mr Thomas,
Thank you very much for your huge help. At least I am now 'somewhere' that moving forward. I followed every steps then here:

Am I missing something? What should happen after "which rtrace" ? which folder should I looking for? or any signs that should appear?

The last command, "which rtrace". should tell you where the binary file 
rtrace is located that gets executed when you simply type "rtrace". That 
assumes that it is actually in one of the directories in your path 
variable. In your case, that seams not to be the case, as the 
which-command did not give any output.

Can you verify that your Radiance-binaries (the bin-subdirectory of the 
Radiance installation) is included in your Path variable?

Cheers, Lars.

That's not good. Perhaps you need to log off and log on again to get the
effect of the new settings. Try that first. If that doesn't help we can move
your installation to "/usr/local". That's works just as well and it's
already in your $PATH.

Thomas

The Blender API has been updated, and brad has not been updated to 
follow the changes.  I can't even find the packages brad uses in the 
current Blender API docs.

I really don't have time to work on this more, unfortunately--anyone 
else who knows Python and OpenGL want to give it a try?

I can look at it if it kann wait until the weekend. But I don't think there
is much point in updating the whole package to a new Blender version. The
current Blender API is still not finalised and may not offer all the
features the script needs.

The best way to use brad is to use an old version of Blender.

Yes I already log off and log on again. Then, i repeat each command
echo $PATHwhich rtrace
I got the same result as yesterday. What should I do now?

Ok. Since we know that "/usr/local/bin" is in already in your $PATH
(previous post) let's just move all the binaries there to give you a quick
solution. I downloaded the same file and checked the folder names. According
to this you should have a folder called "rad4R0_macosx" in your
"Applications" folder. With this setup use the following command in
Terminal:

open /usr/local

A Finder window should pop up. Make sure that there is a "bin" folder. If
there isn't create one. Then move or copy all the files
from /Applications/rad4R0_macosx/  to this /usr/local/bin folder. Don't copy
the "rad4R0_macosx" itself. Now if you use the command

which rtrace

it should print out the path. Now download the "rad3R9supp.tar.gz" and
extract it. It creates a "ray" directory and within it a "lib" directory
(and some others). Create the folder "/usr/local/lib/ray" - yes, this is the
other way around than in the archive. The files in the archive's "ray/lib"
directory need to be moved to "/usr/local/lib/ray". With this setup you
should not need to fiddle with the RAYPATH environment variable because this
is the built-in default.

For now this should get you going.

Regards,
Thomas

For those interested in OS X I found a nice article on stackexchange on the
various configuration options:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/603785/environment-variables-in-mac-os-x

According to this "environment.plist" is outdated and user settings should
go in "~/.launchd.conf". The traditional profile and bashrc files still work
but with the usual confusion as to when these are used (interactive,
non-interactive, login, non-login, ...).

This is a great summary of the too many options for setting these things on OSX; thanks Thomas!

That probably means that your binaries are in a directory 
/Applications/Radiance/rad4R0_maxosx/bin.

Can you try the command:

/Applications/Radiance/rad4R0_maxosx/bin/rtrace

and tell us whether there is any output or error message? I do not have 
a Mac available right now.

Also, do you type commands into the window opening when you start the 
X11 application, or do you type in the Terminal application window? I 
think Thomas posted a great Mac-specific tutorial, which may vary from 
my more generic unix-like experiences. So these details may be of 
importance here.

Cheers, Lars.

Subject: [Radiance-general] rtcontrib - funky error when using -n
Message-ID: <2F128C40-D360-4086-899C-952AA112AE9B@coolshadow.com>

Hi List - 

I have two questions related to rtcontrib. I'll send two messages for separate discussion threads. 

The first is about multi-core runs and a strange error, the second about setting the maximum number of open files on OSX. 

Multi-core runs question:
The following command uses 8 processors and successfully generates a bin of 578 .hdr images based on test.oct made of scene geometry, material descriptions and an isotropic sky:
 
vwrays -ff -vf view.vf -x 800 -y 800 | rtcontrib -n 8 -ab 3 -ad 4000 -as 1000 -dt .05 -ds .1 -dc .17 -lw 9e-19 -e MF:2 -ffc $(vwrays -d -vf view.vf -x 800 -y 800)  -f reinhart.cal -b rbin -o bin/%0d.hdr -m sky_glow  -w tmp/test.oct

For some reason, one of the bin images is funky (381.hdr in this case) and when I try to do anything with it I get a read error. Example:
pvalue -o -h -H 381.hdr > test.txt
pvalue: read error

I found that I can still view the bad image with ximage, and here the error shows up. The image is shifted 82 pixels to the left, with the clipped pixels placed on the right side of the image. 

I re-did the simulation using the exact same command but with just one processor (no -n option) and everything works out fine and dandy. Has anyone else encountered this kind of oddity with multi-core runs and rtcontrib?

Thanks! 

Michael

Subject: [Radiance-general] rtcontrib - setting maximum number of open files
	on OSX 10.6.8
Message-ID: <66BA0299-F9AE-45C0-8CF6-11C5429EC6D4@coolshadow.com>

My second question is for Radiance users running OSX. I'm having trouble setting the maximum number of open files to more than 1024. I'm running OSX 10.6.8, and there seems to be two ways to change the maximum number of open files - one using ulimit and one using launchctl. 

In .bash_profile I have this line: 

ulimit -S -n 4096

In etc/launchchd.conf I have this:

limit maxfiles 4096
sysctl -w kern.maxfiles=4096

and in etc/sysctl.conf I have:

kern.maxfiles=4096 kern.maxfilesperproc=4096 

In a terminal line, when I enter launchctl limit  I see this:

        cpu         unlimited      unlimited      
        filesize    unlimited      unlimited      
        data        unlimited      unlimited      
        stack       8388608        67104768       
        core        0              unlimited      
        rss         unlimited      unlimited      
        memlock     unlimited      unlimited      
        maxproc     266            532            
        maxfiles    4096           4096

Which is good. 4096 is more than the 2306 files I want rtcontrib to talk to at the same time. 

But then, looking at ulimit -a in a terminal, I see this:

core file size          (blocks, -c) 0
data seg size           (kbytes, -d) unlimited
file size               (blocks, -f) unlimited
max locked memory       (kbytes, -l) unlimited
max memory size         (kbytes, -m) unlimited
open files                      (-n) 1024
pipe size            (512 bytes, -p) 1
stack size              (kbytes, -s) 8192
cpu time               (seconds, -t) unlimited
max user processes              (-u) 266
virtual memory          (kbytes, -v) unlimited

Which is bad - 1024 is less than the 2306 files I want rtcontrib to talk to at the same time. Its also surprising given that it should be set to 4096 by .bash_profile. 

Then when I try ulimit -n 4096, I get this: 

bash: ulimit: open files: cannot modify limit: Operation not permitted

If I use sudo, it takes the command, but when I look at ulimit -a again, the open files limit still says 1024, and despite what launchctl limit says, 1024 is the governing number of maximum open files. 

Has anyone out there had success setting this in OSX 10.6 or higher? Or has anyone updated to 10.7 (just released today) and had success? 

Many thanks,
Michael

Hi Michael,

Not sure if this will help or not as this is a linux thing, but perhaps 
there is something similar in OSX. Under linux there is "limits.conf" 
which enables configuration of limits in a number of different ways 
including by username.

Hi Michael,
I had some problem on OSX 10.5.8 but I think this should work on OSX 10.6.8
too.
I guess that by "ulimit -S -n 4096" you don't set it permanently.

Go to .bash_profile or create it in your home folder if you don't have it
there and just insert following

ulimit -n 2306

or higher number of open files if you need.

Hope it will help
David

Hi Michael,
I don't really know anything about launchd.conf, but I can explain why 'sudo ulimit -n 4096' doesn't work.  ulimit applies to the shell instance in which it is called.  When you use sudo you are essentially creating a shell with root permissions to execute the command.  When the command is finished the shell is terminated.  You are effectively changing the properties for a temporary shell, not the one you are trying to use.

Does your user account have admin priveliges?  You can give admin privileges in the system preferences.  If you have admin privileges than you should be able to use ulimit.

Andy

Thanks a bunch for the replies so far. 

Jack - OSX doesn't seem to have a limits.conf configuration file... 

David - switching the .bash_profile line in my home folder from "ulimit -S -n 4096" to "ulimit -n 4096" didn't make the change.. 

Andy - thanks for the sudo explanation - that makes sense as to why it's not making the change. I do have admin privileges, but for some reason I still can't get ulimit to change the limit over 1024. 

Oddly enough, I can get ulimit to lower the maximum number of open files, something like ulimit -n 512 works fine and changes the setting. What I can't do is then increase back to 1024 - I get the 'operation not permitted' message. When I restart my machine, the limit returns to 1024. I can use ulimit and lower it to 1023, but even when I try ulimit -n 1025, I still get the message: 
bash: ulimit: open files: cannot modify limit: Operation not permitted

You are effectively changing the properties for a temporary shell, not the one you are trying to use.

blarg! 

It's always in the last place you look... and after you email the radiance list. 

I needed to add ulimit -n 4096 to .bashrc in my home directory as well...

Hi Michael,

Everyone was so busy on your second question, looks like the first one was neglected:

> Multi-core runs question:
> The following command uses 8 processors and successfully generates a bin of 578 .hdr images based on test.oct made of scene geometry, material descriptions and an isotropic sky:

I can't be sure, but most likely you've run into the "bin counting problem."  Quoting the rtcontrib man page:

	The actual bin number is computed at run time based
       on ray direction and surface intersection, as described below.  If  the
       number of bins is known in advance, it should be specified with the -bn
       option, and this is critical for output files containing multiple  val-
       ues  per  record.   A  variable  or constant name may be given for this
       parameter if it has been defined via a previous -f or -e option.  Since
       bin numbers start from 0, the bin count is always equal to the last bin
       plus 1.  Set the this value to 0 if  the  bin  count  is  unknown  (the
       default).

Not having the -bn option causes trouble in a lot of cases where there isn't always a ray striking the last bin.

Hope this fixes it!

-Greg

Hi everyone,


Would you please help me to provide a list of "well-toplit buildings"? I'm
looking for Roof Daylighting Systems and I want to model them with computer.
Do you have any case studies in mind?


Thank you

I've done with downloading "rad4R0supp.tar.gz" instead. then i copied "ray/lib" directory pasted into "/usr/local/lib.Using Terminal I repeat command 
which trace
then I got
Macintosh-HDs-MacBook-Pro:~ macintoshhd$ which rtrace/usr/local/bin/rtrace
Is this the right path that I should get?

Subject: [Radiance-general] [help] Does the "direct horizontal irradiance"
 in GenCumulativeSky mean the "direct normal radiation" in .epw weather
 file?
Message-ID: <CAD83LVLebghH-H8Q_+93ssTqCNt+SpDBRkaNmUw5pkmz7ZrexA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Radiance experts,

According to the "Solar Irradiation Modeling" document inside the
GenCumulativeSky package (downloaded from
https://documents.epfl.ch/groups/u/ur/urbansimulation/www/GenCumSky/GenCumSky.zip),
the GenCumulativeSky.exe program needs a climate file containing two columns
of data, the first column being either the "global horizontal irradiance" or
"direct horizontal irradiance" and the second column being the "diffused
horizontal irradiance".

In a typical EnergyPlus weather file (.epw file), there's the hourly data on
"global horizontal radiation", "direct normal radiation" and "diffuse
horizontal radiation".

May I ask:* Is the "direct horizontal irradiance" as required by
GenCumulativeSky the same as the "direct normal radiation" as recorded in
the EnergyPlus weather file?*


To my understanding, the "direct normal radiation" means the "amount of
solar radiation in Wh/m2 received within a 5.7? field of view centered on
the sun" (refer to http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/pubs/tmy2/tab3-2.html).

So, the "effective" direct horizontal irradiance, or the effective solar
radiation falling vertically on a horizontal surface, should be a
cosine-weighted "direct normal radiation" according to the solar elevation
angle at a given time. Therefore, the "direct horizontal irradiance" as
required by GenCumulativeSky does NOT mean the same as the "direct normal
radiation" as recorded in the EnergyPlus weather file.

Clarification is appreciated!

- Ji

Yes, sorry. I just had the release 3.9 archive on my disk and copied that
file name instead of the current one.

Success! To be clear: This message means that you can now use the Radiance
commands/applications without using their full path and name. So instead of
typing

/usr/local/bin/oconv somefile.rad > somescene.oct

you can just use

oconv somefile.rad > somescene.oct

This is essential for some tools that use the short path internally. You
downloaded the rad4R0supp.tar.gz archive because it contains a few  files
that are essential for the more advanced calculations in Radiance. You moved
these to /usr/local/lib/ray because that's where Radiance will look for them
by default.

Now you are all set to use Radiance on your Mac. Radiance is all about
writing text files and typing commands in Terminal. You should get used to a
good text editor on the Mac (TextEdit will do but others like TextMate have
more features). Also search the net for tutorials on using the Bash. This is
the environment you are in when you type a command in Terminal. There are
many features of Bash which make your live easier (example: the up-arrow key
recalls the last command you typed, press it again and you go further back
in your command history).

To actually learn Radiance start with the excellent tutorials by Axel
Jacobs:

Dear colleague Radiance modelers,

             My research group seeks  Radiance  models of architectural spaces for experiments related to Designing Visually Accessible Spaces, particularly focusing on low vision issues.  We are developing a   ?hazard  detection? module,  for use by designers and architects, which is now in the validation phase.  Automated results, based on Radiance renderings and data sets, are being correlated with live subject experiments.
            I have exhausted the modest sized, detailed models which I have built over the past decades and seek additional models which include features such as arches, columns, steps, ramps, furniture,  interesting patterns, etc. Images will be produced for presentation to subjects and for analysis. These will remain in-house unless we request permission for publication.

Please contact me directly if you are able to contribute to the project. Ideally a data set includes all scene and lighting descriptions,  a RIF file,   a few images of the environment and an overview to your data structure.

Hi:

The relationship is: Direct Normal Irradiance = Diffuse Horizontal
Irradiance / Sin(Sun_Altitude)

Hi, Jia, Thanks for the clarification!


Well, if this is the case, does it mean that:

Either
1.GenCumulativeSky requires "direct horizontal irradiance" as input for
calculation, but we can only feed in the "direct normal radiation" as that
is what we can get from EnergyPlus weather file. Then, GenCumulativeSky will
"internally" transform the "direct normal radiation" into "direct horizontal
irradiance" by applying the formula: "Direct Horizontal Irradiance = Direct
Normal Irradiance *  Sin(Sun_Altitude)".

Or
2. What is used in GenCumulativeSky's internal calculation is actually
"direct normal irradiance". Then what is stated in the "Solar Irradiation
Modeling" document is not correct.


So, Jia, Can you kindly help to check if the above is correct?

And Dear Darren Robinson, if you can receive this email, can you also kindly
comment?

Thanks!

Ji

Hi,

I am not familiar with this program. I just skim its code. This program use
Horizontal Irradiance values, Not normal. In its "cPerezSkyModel.cpp" file,
you can see this:

if (m_SolarAlt > 0)
Ibn=Ibh/sin(m_SolarAlt);

It converts "direct horizontal" (lbh) to "direct normal" (lbn) and then use
lbn in other parts in this class.It is better to re-calculate "Direct
horizontal irra" which would be served as an input

Another option is to revise some parts of the code. Change the above code to
the follows and rebuild to get a new .exe file:

if (m_SolarAlt > 0)
Ibn=Ibh;


In your input weather file (txt), the first column is "global horizontal"
and the second column is "direct normal". Then you set -G option in its
command.

I have not tested the second method.

Best,

Jia

Dear Mr Thomas,

Thank You very much! Yes I do have Axel's Radiance Tutorial in front of me right now. 

Hope to have conversation with you in another phase of Radiance rendering works.

The "London_weather_file_global_and_diffuse_radiation.txt" used contains two
columns of data extracted from London's epw file that are "global horizontal

The CumulativeSky_df_London.cal and a SunFile.rad files were generated. And
the SunFile.rad file contains 2165 sun position definitions.


May I ask:

3. Will the error affect the two files generated?

Hello all:

Some papers point out Radiance cannot be used to simulate light pipe or
anidolic system performance. Do you have any suggestion about how to
simulate these systems that require multiple reflections?

Thank you,

Hi Jia!

I have some unfinished work on this lying around for almost one year 
now, and this topic arises again and again on this mailing list. It is 
true that the standard backwards-raytracing approach of Radiance is not 
suitable for such systems. There are several ways to simulate these if 
you are aware of what is happening, and, more important even, what kind 
of results you need.

In general, if you do not need high angular resolution, the tools 
developed for patch-based sky models are working, and you can even 
calculate the BDSF now using the Radiance-toolchain as long as you are 
more interested in the integrated transmission then in high angular 
resolution. So - if you need to know how many hours a year you can reach 
a certain illuminance on a work plane, that should work. If you want to 
perform glare studies, I would question such results.

For high angular resolution, switching from backwards to forward 
raytracing is more efficient, and here the photon map extension is what 
we have available right now. Unfortunately, the development status is 
not really clear, and at least the latest available versions had some 
bugs that can heavily influence results depending on sky conditions / 
models.

One entirely different approach is to use some optical modeling tool to 
get the transmission distribution or, even easier, to get luminaire 
distributions for certain times of day / dates / weather conditions.

And then, you are free to circumvent the whole ambient calculation and 
try do keep everything in the direct calculation, which works fine with 
such setups. So for calculating horizontal irradiance, you would place a 
fisheye-type camera with a full hemisperical view on you point of 
interest looking up and integrate the radiance - as long as you 
reflector is completely specular w/o roughness.

Cheers, Lars.

How about the accuracy of calculated illuminance? Is that accurate or
acceptable?  If I use Radiance toolchain (rtcontrib), do I have to use metal
material for tubular (round) pipe, and mirror or metal for square pipe?

The extension is developed for Radiance 3.7. It seems not updated for
several years. Is that suitable for annual simulation?

I know little about these tools. Is the optical modeling tool capable of
doing annual simulation? Could you recommend some tools? I just heart about
Photopia and only tried once.  It would be better if the tool is free, but
this does not matter.

Do you mean I separate direct and ambient calculations? Could you tell me
how to do direct calculation only? If I set ab =0, it underestimates the
direct sunlight illuminance. I do not know how to let the direct sunlight
enter in to the space through the tubular light pipe. What materials should
I have to use for the light pipe?

Thank you very much.

If those are the only errors I expect that you do.

I haven't used GenCumulativeSky but from what I remember from the discussion
of this tool GenCumulativeSky uses gendaylit to create sky models. Gendaylit
has difficulties with low sky angles and doesn't create useful sky
descriptions for these times of day. There is only one or two errors per day
so I assume the errors happen for early morning or late evening (altitude <
6 degree). To solve this error properly we need a better gendaylit program.



> 3. Will the error affect the two files generated?
>

I would expect that these entries in your climate file are simply not
represented in the the cumulative sky model. A way to work around this might
be to hack gencumulativesky to provide gendaylit with explicit sun positions
and artificially increase the altitude to be above 6 degree.

Regards,
Thomas

It would be interesting to know the source of the values below 6 
degrees, as typical sky scanners are not able to measure these directly. 
This means that the values represent probably not measured but derived 
data (total horizontal irradiance - diffuse horizontal irradiance).

Cheers, Lars.

Hi Everyone,

I'm trying to render some images for a perceptual experiment. When I 
render with a sunlit sky (+s) I have no problems, but the variations in 
illumination are too great - I need more uniformity. But when I change 
the options to no sun (i.e. overcast "-c", or sunny without sun "-s") I 
get an error from rpict:

rpict: warning - no light sources found.

Some key parameters:-

gensky 01 01 13 +s -a 56.3400 -o  0 -m 0.00 -B 27.93 <-- substitute "+s" 
with "-c" or "-s"

This is all running on mingw radiance on a windows PC. Anyone have any 
suggestions?

Hi George,

The "no light sources found" error is because there is no sun in your sky
model. The celestial hemisphere's sky glow is indeed just that, it's
modeled as a "glow" source in Radiance. Glows are only picked up in the
ambient calculation, so you need to have -ab set to at least 1. You have
-ab 5, so you should be good. As the message states, it's not an error,
merely a warning. You're good.

By the way... is the warning not somehow obsolete and misleading in 
times, where a lot of tools of the Radiance toolkit rely on scenes 
including no light-type objects? I think I would prefer to have the 
warning removed, as it may be more irritating then helpful these days. 
If there was a simple way to check whether a scene contains neither 
light nor glow object, that would be useful - but probably not that easy 
to detect.

Cheers, Lars.

At the 2006 workshop Axel suggested that the Radiance community create a logo for Radiance.  He joked that without a proper logo our t-shirts would look like this:

That warning is still the closest thing we have to a logo.

Maybe we should define a dress code for this year's workshop ;-)

The warning should be updated -- I have a suggestion:

"Warning - no light sources found. Wait a mo', you're NOT doing a daylight factor calculation, ARE YOU? I mean, really, in this day and age.  Or could it be the clear sky option in LEED?  Think about it: a clear sky WITHOUT sun - a physically impossible illumination condition in nature!  Isn't that just a bit weird? No, no, don't hit Ctrl-C, I haven't finished..."

Ok, John, you gave me an idea, why not have all warning message strings
replaced by some http-requests piping this mailing list's archives to
STDERR? It is not wearable though :-(

Since we're having a particularly cheeky couple of days with this thread, I
thought I'd share. John, your verbose warning message reminded me of a post
I wrote a few years ago about "green" email signatures:

No one ever heard of a solar eclipse around here?

Btw.: Since I'm an aesthetic minimalist, my preferred choice
for a t-shirt print would be:

Wouldn't be too difficult to squelch this warning when -ab > 0 and some glow object is present. 

But then what will we do for entertainment?

If I'm not wrong, does the "-w" option means "hey, Radiance, I know what I'm
doing, so just SHUT UP!  ... @^*XXX&?^!(@&*XX?X@!_ at ...*&%?!!..  )

Hehe, - Ji

There is a new project that works with Blender 2.57:

Don't know if it's already released yet, though.

That looks cool, but they seam not to fully release it as open source, 
which leaves some questionmarks (it is basically a great integration of 
existing open source software into Blender).

Cheers, Lars.
