Hi,

I wonder if anybody know how I can run DAYSIM commands such as gen_dc and
gen_directsunlight on multiple processors.

My understanding is both of them are sort of rtrace command so using -n
option shouldn't be impossible.

Thanks,

This is an excellent point Mostapha. I do not think that it will work because rtrace_dc cannot work with an ambient file which (I think) one needs for the "-n" option. But, I would be very happy to stand corrected.

I don't think ?n requires an ambient cache. It's wasteful of cycles with a traditional point-in-time rendering to not share the ambient data, but it's not required to take advantage of MP.

Hi Mostapha,

the -n option for multiple-core usage as it is implemented into rtrace
is not working for rtrace_dc. In the (still unofficial) version of
rtrace_dc of daysim 3.1, the -n  is supported but unfortunately does not
have any impact on the calculation speed... :-( . I've tested that
already. So with the current version it doesn't make sense to use this
option and block the other cores.
Maybe a later version supports this option.

Christoph: An ambient file is not necessary for -n.

By the way, does anybody know, if there is a limit for the -n option in
rtrace?
I tested it on my new 48(!!) core machine, but couldn't use more than 9
cores, the other processes are existent  but don't use any cpu-time....

 Hi

 I would really like to get into using Radiance software for daylighting purposes, however am unsure how to convert files to use with the software. Currently our office uses Vectorworks  (we are a MAC based office), and we would like to convert 3D models to use for daylighting studies with Radiance software. I am unsure how to convert to a file that Radiance can use. Are you aware of how I can explore the file? Have others ran into this issue before? I have heard people have used sketchup models to be used with Radiance. 

Any information you could provide me with would be VERY VERY helpful.

If you can export these formats: 3ds, obj, dxf, there are tools to convert to Radiance.
dxf2rad
3ds2rad
obj2rad
obj2mesh

Or into Sketchup or Blender that have a Radiance plugins

Rachelle,

I think I'd put the question to Vectorworks support: it may be a FAQ 
for them.  Here's a few thoughts off the top of my head, but more 
questions than answers, I fear.

Radiance accepts input in its own surface model format, which is 
relatively straightforward.  Radiance also supports import from the old 
Alias|Wavefront ("obj") format, which unfortunately does not seem to be 
supported by Vectorworks.  You will have to do your own material format 
conversions; the material models used by rasterizing renderers are of 
limited value in physically-based rendering and simulation.

To convert geometry, you would have to go through some intermediary 
program, either a conversion tool, another CAD system, or a home-brew 
Vectorworks script.  SketchUp Pro is just about the only CAD system 
choice I can think of on Mac--it works, but can produce messy geometry 
and may have problems with some complex curved geometries.  If you have 
any Windows systems around, it appears that there are a number of 
converter choices: 3D Object Converter (claims to directly support 
Radiance format), Quick3D, AccuTrans, PolyTrans, and so on.  Rhino is 
an excellent Windows CAD tool generally and relatively inexpensive.

Let us know what you end up doing!

Randolph

Hi Rachelle,

I have exported from Vectorworks some years ago. Vectorworks supports a 
bunch of 3d formats, so this used to be no problem. As far as I know, 
unfortunately, there is no support for wavefront obj. So you should try 
either to export

1) 3ds, which can be converted to mgf (using 3ds2mgf) and then to rad 
(mgf2rad)

2) dxf, which can be converted to rad using Georg Mischler's dxf2rad 
(available at http://www.schorsch.com/en/download/dxf2rad/ )

There is also IGES-support in Vectorworks, so it may be an option to 
store all model data in IGES (which is a full 3d CAD standard, so the 
models are not a mess of triangles but keep all the information) and 
develop a toolchain to integrate IGES into your Radiance environment. 
There is IGES-support in a wide range of open-source, scripteable tools now.

Cheers, Lars.

Thanks.  Yes, I've looked at it and will do more looking.

I am suspecting that no-one has done general convergence studies on the 
algorithms used in Radiance, alas.  It would be really useful 
information to have in hand for us practitioners.  Sounds like it could 
be a PhD dissertation in applied mathematics, though.

my doubt is what is the difference between dgp and dgi (Daylight Glare

both give the number values... but probability and index... what do we

what about dgp?

would be of great help if the confusion in me is cleared.

In short, both DGI and DGP are intended to do the same (index of comfort, or tolerable glare as you say), but in the Wienold dissertation that Mostapha references, the DGP is found to have better correlation to actual user perception than DGI.

Keep in mind that Wienold's study was limited to shallow floor plate office environments and glare from daylight specifically. It is great work, but you need to keep the context in mind when considering the metric.

Thanks.  I'm not sure if it helps either, but it's interesting.  
There's an introduction to irradiance caching in Lecture 11, too, and 
Radiance is directly discussed.

To: alstan at jakubiec.net, "Reinhart, Christoph" <reinhart at gsd.harvard.edu>


good evenign sir.

i have gone through the paper "the adaptive zone" and i ahve this
presentation also with me...which was in Radiance workshop 2010.

sir im still in confusion or i guess im misssing my basics. sorrry for this
but i need to get it cleared and hope it gets done with your help.

now here's the situation..

i have done glare simulations through Radiance and got the values thorugh
evalglare program.

for ex: these are my values for a particular renedered radiance image .

dgp - 0.299183
dgi - 23.436073

as per the index given in the presentation this is what it says.

                                            dgp                   dgi
imperceptible glare            < 0.35              <18
percpetible glare               0.35 - 0.4          18 - 24
disturbing glare                 0.4 - 0.45           24 - 31
intolerable glare                > 0.45                  > 31

my question is now if i go by this index :-
if i consider dgp it wil state "imperceptible glare" and
if i consider dgi it will state "perceptible"

this is my confusion and if i go by dgp then all my cases are impercpetible
glare. for which i think i m wrong somewhere ...

hope you got the situation sir. pls help me out in this and also let me know
if im wrong somewhere or missing my basics. sorry for trouble

im also hereby attaching the rendered image form radiance...

thanks
dhaRam

Did you read Jan's publications on the development of the DGP? It is not 
surprising to get different results using different methods - if the 
results were identical, Jan would have done the work for nothing. One of 
the keys is whether you have a large transmissive glazing/facade (high 
vertical illuminance) or more some small windows (high ratios max/min 
luminances). But again, it is best to read it from Jan's work, he spent 
some time on it. One more nice introduction by Jan is available here:

Cheers, Lars.

Hi All:

I have a grad student who has been working on running Radiance and 3DS Max alongside each other through these test cases - as step one in his understanding of matching real to simulated data. Apart from re-identifying the erroneous data in one of the datasets, and the extreme render settings for convergence for another case, he has identified two reports of work (with Radiance) like this. Anyone know:

a)      How we might get access to the full data

b)      How we might contact these folks?

Hi Chris, Rob and Jan,

Hopefully this option will be added in the near future. For know I would
like to share the solution I came up with. To have the result on time I ran
multiple simulations at the same time instead of using multiple CPU's for
one simulation.

It's true that you cannot use multiple CPU's to run DAYSIM commands, but
there is no reason not to run multiple DAYSIM commands on one system as far
as you have enough RAM. So you can divide the sensors and run them at the
same time on one system. This simple trick saved me a huge amount of time.

Have a good weekend,
Mostapha

I guess I didn't read Jan's post very carefully, or I might have responded to his question about limits to the rtrace -n option.  There are no encoded limits.  As far as performance on many cores, I've gotten linear speedups with up to 24 processes, which is as many as I'm able to test.  The -x option will kill performance if not combined with -y, since it has to flush after the given number of rays, which means clearing the queue that often.

The -af setting IS important to rtrace -n if you set -ab > 0 and -aa > 0 also.  This is true of all parallel processes in Radiance.

Cheers,
-Greg
