Subject: [Radiance-general] virtual light sources with mirror & diffuse
	component
Message-ID: <1343902307.17530.37.camel@ccmse-sim>

Hi all,

I am currently setting up a scene where I need the mirror modifier to
create virtual light sources. This mirror will stand for a metal sheet
with high specularity - but also some diffuse reflectance. First it
seams to be obvious, but the more I think about it the less sure I am
about it.

I defined a mirror material referencing a metal material, which includes
both the absolute reflectance and the specularity.

Example:

void metal mySheetMetal
0
0
5 .9 .9 .9 .8 0

That should lead to a specular reflectance of .9 * .8 = .72

(Typically, one would know the specular and absolute reflectance from
measurements and have to calculate the specularity from it - the other
way around.)

Is it this specular reflectance value of .72 that I have to use in my
mirror materials definition? Like

void mirror mySheetMirror
1 mySheetMetal
0
3 .72 .72 .72

My understanding is that the virtual source should have the value of the
original source times the specular reflectance, while for all rays not
hitting the sheet at an angle leading to the source in mirror direction
would lead to ambient sampling according to the metal definition.

Is this correct, do the metal and the mirror material match each other
in my example?

Cheers, Lars.

Hi

I have downloaded obj model with its
- Model in obj format
- Diffuse, normal and spec map in tga formats
- a .mtl file.


i am able to convert model into rad file using ?obj2rad command.

example : obj2rad house.obj > house.rad


A)
but i suppose the texture is not attached and need to be incorporated in its converted rad file.

is there any way, while conversion from obj to rad, ?texture description is also incorporated in the rad file?

How can i incorporate texture file. ?


B) the rad file gives the triangle details after conversion. If i want to move entire model at specific position of the scene, is there any group operation possible. ??



Regards Brajesh

Hi Brajesh,

Look into the obj2mesh program.  It does most of what you need.  There is an earlier thread (at least one) on how to map UV coordinates.  See:

As far as I can tell, your analysis and the parameters you derived are correct.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Updated Radiance Installers Available
Message-ID: <CC496CA2.13440%robert.guglielmetti@nrel.gov>

Howdy folks,

Just wanted to let the community know there are updated Radiance
installers posted on the NREL OpenStudio website, on the Radiance
support page (sorry for the wrapped/busted links, you gotta copy/paste):

https://openstudio.nrel.gov/getting-started-developer/getting-started-
radiance

A couple of recent additions are support for the planispheric view type
in the Qtrvu application (thanks to Zack Rogers for pointing out the
deficiency), and the addition of a rewrite of the objview.csh script in
Ruby, so now Windows users have access to that utility. The Ruby version
of objview also has a luminaire viewer option (-l) which takes an
ies2rad-generated luminaire description and places it in a box so that
the luminous distribution can be evaluated visually. See the man page
for details.

Note also there is a new Sheriff in town, vis a vis contribution
counting. Greg has added a new version of rtcontrib, called ?rcontrib?.
It?s way faster than rtcontrib, and should be used as a direct
replacement for rtcontrib in your daylight coefficient investigations.
The makeall script actually doesn?t even compile rtcontrib anymore,
instead creating a symlink called rtcontrib that points to the new
rcontrib. We have decided to compile both programs in the NREL
installers, in case anyone wants to do some comparisons or validations
between the two. Point being if you use the NREL Radiance installers,
When you call rtcontrib, you are in fact getting rtcontrib! So, there.

BTW, we have also posted documentation on how to use the
Radiance-related functionality in OpenStudio, which is currently
implemented in a series of Ruby scripts. You can check that out here:

https://openstudio.nrel.gov/getting-started-developer/getting-started-
radia nce/openstudio%E2%80%99s-radiance-functionality-documentation

Have fun, kids.

Hi,

I've read in Rob's post about new rtcontrib version, then searched throught
mail archives and found that Greg write a note about in some mail 2 months
ago.

I'm interested what is in fact changed in rtcontrib calculation algorithm
(if I understood well it doesn't use rtrace any more)?

I suppose new version is available in HEAD source code version? Is it
called 'rcontrib' or 'rtcontrib'?


Rob, for Windows binaries I see there are rcontrib and rtcontrib.
So rcontrib calls new version and rtcontrib old version. Right?



Thanks,
Marija

The new one is rcontrib, but there is a symlink named rtcontrib pointing 
to it, so you do not need to change your scripts.

Hi all,

Marija, yes, the new rcontrib is in the HEAD, and is available in the latest NREL binaries. Lars, the symlink is only created by the makeall script. If you use the NREL binaries, rtcontrib is really rtcontrib, and rcontrib is rcontrib. Clear as mud, eh? Greg, you should have named rcontrib "totally_different_coefficient_calculator". =)

AFAIK, the only summary is the diff between the rtcontrib and rcontrib

Functionally, the rcontrib replacement of rtcontrib is meant to be identical.  The only real difference should be performance.  There is a minor exception to this, which is that rcontrib *requires* the -bn option when -b is anything but "0".  This was always good practice before, and now it is enforced.  All the options and behavior is otherwise the same.

Under the hood, the code has changed dramatically.  Before, rtcontrib was a separate process that would call rtrace with either -oTW or -oTV options, generating a huge trace tree that would have to be interpreted by rtcontrib.  This was slow under the best of circumstances, and got much slower as rtrace processes were added using the -n option.  The rtcontrib process ended up being a major bottleneck.  The new code is a single program that forks copies of itself to do the ray-tracing, summing up contributions in each child process.  This avoids the inter-process communication, memory overhead, and aforementioned summation bottleneck of the original.  I have also added optimizations for when -c is greater than 1 by further batching summations in child processes and reducing communication overhead that way.  If you aren't getting linear speed-up with a particular scene and -n setting, increasing -c should get you there.

We have done a fair amount of testing to where we feel pretty confident there are no major bugs in the new code, but feedback is welcome.  Lars and I are currently trying to track down some anomalies he's seeing in testing, but by the time of the workshop things should be sorted out if not sooner.

Cheers,
-Greg

Hey Greg,

Excellent. Many thanks for the quick summary. I had noticed the name 
change on a build from current head source I did on a new virtual 
machine a few weeks ago. Happily my scripts that I had put together 
based on the original rtcontrib seem to run fine.

Best,

-Jack

Subject: [Radiance-general] Modelling of a lightshelf
Message-ID: <DUB104-W510CE01A7162657AE8014FEEB70@phx.gbl>






Dear all, 

I
 have tried to model a lightshelf inside a single room in order to 
verify its impact but It seems that Daysim consider this element like an
 obstacle to light more than a reflecting object. Is there any simple 
way to model a typical lightshelf?

I would like to thank you in advance for your assistance.

Kind regards,

Hi Virginie,

for the reflector to be considered properly with direct sun exposure, 
you need to model its surface using the mirror modifier.

I gave an example (as I was not sure about the way how I derived the 
values from a metal surface) earlier this month. Subject was "virtual 
light sources with mirror & diffuse component", date 2.8.2012.

Cheers, Lars.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Materials definition
Message-ID: <DUB104-W42763EDE19B09F4279EB28EEB70@phx.gbl>








Dear all,

I have already done some daylighting simulations now. However, the low 
results obtained stroke me and I think that I cannot trust them. I suppose that my definition of materials is not correct. In fact, I am using Google Sketchup and Daysim in order to conduct my simulations. A daysim materials library can be imported in Sketchup. Currently, when I used the typical singleglazclear90 I have this description "void
 trans SingGlaz 0 0 7 0.9001 0.9001 0.9001 0.0000 0.0000 0.0909 1.0000".
 In order to check if I understood properly the trans definition, I 
would like to know if it means that my glazing only transmits about 10% 
of light inside my room? I have some difficulties to fully understand the trans definition. Nevertheless, when I try to change the 
transmission parameters, the results seems to be too high... If someone could help me to understand, I would be very grateful. 

In addition, I have seen that there is another way to define glazing, with the glass definition. What is the difference between these two definitions of materials? What is the simplest way to define a typical single glazing? There may be a library with examples of glazing that I could use?

I would like to thank you in advance.

Kind regards,

The trans material is for translucent materials. Getting its parameters
defined is rather complex and one of the frequently asked questions.

For a typical, clear glazing, glass is the option you should use! It is
an approximation, as not a solid glass volume is considered but the
glass pane is approximated as a zero-thickness pane of given transmissivity.

If you do not have manufacturer data available, download the optics tool
from lbnl, which takes values of the international glazing database
(igdb) to set up your glazing made of glass panes, coatings, air gaps.
This tool will offer an export option to Radiance, which will be a glass
definition for a typical clear glazing.

Cheers, Lars.

Or, if you already know the glass transmission you want to model, you can calculate transmissivity for the material definition from the total visible transmission (Tn in this formula):
>From http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/ray.html#Materials
  transmissivity = (sqrt(.8402528435+.0072522239*Tn*Tn)-.9166530661)/.0036261119/Tn

So, if you want a glass of 90% transmission, replacing Tn with 0.9 gives transmissivity of 0.9801, so your radiance material would look like

void glass glass_90percent_transmission
0 0 3	0.9801 0.9801 0.9801

Howdy simulationists,

I'm pleased to announce the creation of two new mailing lists under the
radiance-online.org umbrella, "radiance-daysim", and
"radiance-openstudio". As Radiance integration efforts continue around
Daysim and OpenStudio, we thought it might be nice to offer these focused
mailing lists where users can post Radiance questions in the context of
these two applications. You can subscribe and browse the new lists here:

http://www.radiance-online.org/community/mailing-lists

I would encourage OpenStudio users to continue to post to the OpenStudio
Forums (https://openstudio.nrel.gov/forum) as well, but I believe these
new lists here could attract lots of Radiance folks and collectively
provide a richer knowledge base than I am currently capable of doing on
the OpenStudio forum. I can't speak for Christoph, but I expect he feels
the same way about his Daysim & DIVA forums.

Big thanks to Andy McNeil, Greg Ward, Christoph Reinhart, Rick Mistrick,
and Jan Wienold for coordinating this, and to Danny Fuller and LBNL for
hosting the lists.

OK, bye.

- Rob

P.S.
When you do go to the radiance-online.org site, how about offering up some
props to Danny and Andy once again, for the new improved look! =8-)

	radiance-openstudio
Message-ID: <CC516D37.13745%robert.guglielmetti@nrel.gov>

Howdy simulationists,

I'm pleased to announce the creation of two new mailing lists under the
radiance-online.org umbrella, "radiance-daysim", and
"radiance-openstudio". As Radiance integration efforts continue around
Daysim and OpenStudio, we thought it might be nice to offer these focused
mailing lists where users can post Radiance questions in the context of
these two applications. You can subscribe and browse the new lists here:

http://www.radiance-online.org/community/mailing-lists

I would encourage OpenStudio users to continue to post to the OpenStudio
Forums (https://openstudio.nrel.gov/forum) as well, but I believe these
new lists here could attract lots of Radiance folks and collectively
provide a richer knowledge base than I am currently capable of doing on
the OpenStudio forum. I can't speak for Christoph, but I expect he feels
the same way about his Daysim & DIVA forums.

Big thanks to Andy McNeil, Greg Ward, Christoph Reinhart, Rick Mistrick,
and Jan Wienold for coordinating this, and to Danny Fuller and LBNL for
hosting the lists.

OK, bye.

- Rob

P.S.
When you do go to the radiance-online.org site, how about offering up some
props to Danny and Andy once again, for the new improved look! =8-)

Our sincere apologies for this!!  Something went wrong with the mailman server when we added the new lists Rob mentioned, and a bunch of us got hundreds of duplicate e-mails in our inboxes.  Daniel Fuller seems to have resolved the issue, although I'm still not sure what happened.

For the future, it's a good idea for people to refrain from posting to the list if something goes wrong, since it only adds to the noise.  It's best to write to me personally if you spot a problem.

Thanks,
-Greg

Subject: [Radiance-general] Reflectance of different material
Message-ID: <1345635083.47677.YahooMailNeo@web171205.mail.ir2.yahoo.com>

Dear users

Does anyone have knowledge of the reflectance of copper?
I am also looking for flooring products with reflectances of 0,3. It could be tiles, wooden floors or capets. Does anyone have knowledge of flooring products with such a high reflectance?


Best regards

Per Haugaard

Dear Per,

The RGB reflectance of copper may be computed from its complex index of refraction as a function of wavelength.  The following result is the closest approximation for Radiance:

void metal Copper
0
0
5 0.926278 0.636980 0.534138 1 0

It assumes the surface is clean and perfectly polished with no dust or scratches.

Cheers,
-Greg
