Hi Greg,

Sorry for my late reply. I am going to tell you and others the result of
your method in the near future. I am still reading your code.

Happy New Year~~~

Thank you.

Subject: [Radiance-general] errors installing radiance 4.1
Message-ID: <0b38ac151b3e0504b6e6483cbe123757.squirrel@calmail.berkeley.edu>

Please excuse what is most likely a simple error . . .

I am trying to install Radiance 4.1 on a new mac and have followed the
following instructions:

(1) download and unzip rad4R1all.tar.gz

(2) cd into ray

(3) sudo tcsh ./makeall install

(entering the default responses when prompted . . )

The libraries installed, as evidenced by:

ls /usr/local/lib/ray

However, the binaries were not created:

ls /usr/local/bin/ray

. . . . reveals only dev and rmake

the result is this error message:

You can purchase it from me.  It is US$35 + shipping and handling.  I 
have them in stock.  I sell them directly, rather than through Amazon, 
to keep the price low.

Truth in advertising: the current printing (the third) has only small 
corrections from the original edition.

Hi Jill,

Older versions of oconv had a lot of problems with really crazy geometry (usually crazy geometry that didn't need to be so crazy, like a zillion polygons defining a doorknob, or lots of coincident polys). You can increase the ?r option in oconv which helps, but increases compilation time and octree size. Two better solutions are 1) build the cleanest models you can, and 2) use a newer version of oconv.exe. You can grab a semi-recent version here:

https://openstudio.nrel.gov/getting-started/getting-started-windows

Scroll down to the "Radiance Binaries" section and there's a link there.

Also, make sure you haven't included your model multiple times -- I've seen this happen with overlapping, identical geometry.  Geometry that comes to a point with many polygons sharing the same vertex is the usual source of this error.  I think the limit is 510 elements sharing a vertex or an infinitesimal volume of space.  Things like Rob's doorknob example can often be represented more simply in Radiance's native surface primitives than they can using triangles if that's an option.

Best,
-Greg

Thank you! It turns out that there was hidden geometry in SketchUp that

Subject: [Radiance-general] Illuminance Values in Ecotect/Radiance
Message-ID: <001a01ccd128$d068d510$713a7f30$@net>

Hello,

 

I am having some problems in calculating illuminance levels for my model. My
model was built and imported into Ecotect and then exported to Radiance for
lighting analysis. The Radiance-calculated value for luminance (cdm-2) are
similar to what I measured on-site. However, once I exported my model to
Radiance for illuminance calculations (lux),  the lux values were ten times
higher than what I measured from the site! Can anyone advise what might go
wrong with my simulation? The simulation was conducted for a night time
scenario and with artificial lighting only. Does Radiance take into account
the luminous efficacy of the lamps? I read other threads too and it seems
that the default luminous efficacy value is set to 179 and that is for
daylit condition. However, a general efficacy value for, say, incandescent
lamp is 14. I do not know where to set the luminous efficacy in
Ecotect/Radiance and I am not sure if this is the reason why the computed
lux values are approximately ten times higher than in the reality?

 

Many Thanks,

vil

Vil,
your is a very wide and general question.
It is difficult to help you without teaching you radiance from A to Z.
So I think the best advice is to look for tutorials over the internet and start from the basics.
WIth the command line.



The 179 number is not intuitive, but has nothing to do with practical things.
For historic reasons (fee free to dig in the archive for an answer) we all divide the photometrical measures by 179 and use the converted radiometric values in Radiance.
Then we get the radiometric results from Radiance and multiply them again by 179 to retrieve the photometrical equivalent;
So we all divide the input by 179 and multiply the output by 179 in a simulation that is linear.
We could do without multiplying?. and would be the same :-)
If you know what you are doing, then you can skip the above, but as we all collaborate with others it is not advisable? because your colleagues could be assuming that you are using the 179 conversion anyway? 
So we all do it.
:-)


If you are confused because there is a luminous efficacy of lamps and then the Radiance 179 value, be reassured:
There is anything to do between each other.

To get the luminance of a surface, knowing the geometry and the flux you should use the command line:
lampcolor
This will spit out the radiometrical quantities that you need to use in the light/glow/illum primitives

To convert from a ies file to a radiance luminaire file you should use:
ies2rad
This will do all for you, all conversion, but beware that unless you force the lamp to be 'white' you could be using a lumen depreciation from the radiance library (as opposed to a lumen depreciation that you would like to use based on a particular design and cleaning/relamping regime).

in all cases you should check what has come out of the commands.
To do this you should familiarise with the rcalc and rtrace commands.
rcalc
rtrace
You should for example measure the illuminance around the luminaire  to estimate the luminous intensity and check that the light fixture is pointing in the right way.
Everybody has his own script/method to do this.
When I started I found easy to create a big sphere around the fixture, and render two fisheye views of illuminance. if you divide by the square radius you get the intensity plot...


About your issue, the 10 coefficient is a bit strange. Could it be a setting like lux vs Fc? Maybe this is something in Ecotect?

Good luck,
G

May seem silly, but a 10x difference seems like the difference between lux and footcandles. Maybe your site measurements are in fc, or maybe you are multiplying your Radiance results to convert to lux when they were already in lux?

If you know your illuminance and lux measurement for one point, and can estimate the surface reflectance, you can check the formula L = E * R / Pi to see if it all makes sense. If L is in cd/m2 then E must be in lux for that formula.

Subject: [Radiance-general] esp-r and radiance
Message-ID: <43AC8FF96AEAFA43B65D1EDF7FD1C1217E8CE2F6@ALUDRA.university.brighton.ac.uk>

Dear All,

I am using esp-r and I would like to create some nice images of interiors with daylight factors using radiance. I am using a version of esp-r compiled from the source code and I can open a radiance desktop from there, however that does not seem to work properly at the moment. Does any of you know what the problem may be? I am thinking of installing a window version of radiance, do you know how to make it work with esp-r? Let me know, I look forward to hearing from you,

Regards,
Arianna

Subject: [Radiance-general] pixel axis origin
Message-ID: <4F1D8519.40500@gmail.com>

Folks,

I reported the RGB values from an HDR image using the following command:
pvalue -h -H -o filename.hdr

I get something like:
       0    3743       2.713e-03       2.541e-03       2.541e-03
       1    3743       2.713e-03       2.541e-03       2.541e-03
       2    3743       2.730e-03       2.558e-03       2.627e-03
       3    3743       2.747e-03       2.592e-03       2.661e-03
       4    3743       2.696e-03       2.610e-03       2.661e-03
       5    3743       2.730e-03       2.644e-03       2.696e-03
       6    3743       2.627e-03       2.644e-03       2.661e-03
       7    3743       2.696e-03       2.696e-03       2.713e-03
       8    3743       2.782e-03       2.696e-03       2.747e-03

My question is: where is the (0,0) located? Bottom left of the image? 
And then the result of that command prints the pixel from top left?

Thanks,

Ery

Hi Ery,

See page 31 of:

	http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/filefmts.pdf

The standard ordering follows from the upper-left to the upper-right, then down by scanlines.  The final row starts with (0,0), which is the left-most X coordinate and bottom-most Y coordinate.

If you want a different ordering, you can pass the image through pflip, first.

Cheers,
-Greg

Dear Radiance and DIVA users,

I am forwarding this message at the request of Holly Samuelson, president  
of IBPSA-Boston. On February 7th IBPSA-Boston is hosting an event on using  
daylight simulations for design which will be of interest to many of you.  
For those not in Boston, the event will be webcast online. Details can be  
found in Holly's message below.

Kind regards,
Alstan

Subject: Daylight Simulation in Design - Event and Webcast


IBPSA Boston in conjunction with IES Boston is excited to present our next  
event, Daylight Simulation in Design, on February 7th from 6:00-7:30pm EST  
at MIT, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  We have two groups of  
speakers who will present some interesting applications of daylight  
simulation in architecture projects.  As usual,  the event will be webcast  
and web-archived.  Please RSVP to ibpsa.boston at gmail.com if you plan to  
attend in person.  Details below.
(Also, please save the date for our next event/webcast, a joint meeting  
the evening of March 13 with ASHRAE and AEE.)

Daylight Simulation in Design
February 7, 6:00-7:30pm EST
MIT, building 7 (aka 77 Massachusetts Ave.) room 431 (aka the Long Lounge)
Social event to follow at a local pub TBD.  Munchies provided.

Presentation Synopses:
Schroepfer + Hee?s New Jurong Church (planned for completition in 2013) is  
an approximately 10,000 sqm religious and cultural facility located in the  
densely populated western part of Singapore. The presenters will discuss  
how, with the need to mitigate the harsh climate conditions of the tropics  
and yet not have a high dependence on mechanical cooling systems, the  
conception and design of the building envelope employed state-of-the-art  
lighting and energy use simulations to make full use of passive systems,  
leading to an understanding of architecture in that form, material,  
structure and performance are not seen as separate elements, but rather as  
complex interrelations.

Daylight modeling can be a powerful tool in the professional architectural  
world, but it can also create various challenges. Using examples from  
their work at Lam Partners, the presenters will show ways in which  
daylight modeling can be crafted strategically to support design ideas, as  
well as some of the hurdles to using this type of analysis on projects.  
The presentation will touch upon topics such as cost, efficiency and  
marketing.
Speakers:
Thomas Schroepfer, Associate Professor at Singapore University of  
Technology and Design and Principal at Schroepfer + Hee
Alstan Jakubiec, PhD Candidate at MIT
Azadeh Omidfar, Researcher at MIT, Designer at Einhorn Yaffee Prescott

Subject: [Radiance-general] Strange behaviour of xform
Message-ID: <4F2248C9.20701@curtin.edu.au>

Downloaded and compiled Head (2012/01/23) on linux (Ubuntu 10.10)

Xform does not seem to want to work with sub files unless running as 
root - I don't understand why and have not had problem in previous versions!

Example of problem can be replicated below:
cd /tmp
mkdir test
cd test
cat > box.rad << EOF
!genbox blue_plastic box .5 .5 .5
EOF

cat > main.rad << EOF
void plastic blue_plastic
0
0
5 .1 .1 .6 .05 .1

!xform -rz 15 -t .5 .75 0 box.rad
EOF

getbbox main.rad
xform: cannot find file "box.rad"
      xmin      xmax      ymin      ymax      zmin      zmax
     1e+10    -1e+10     1e+10    -1e+10     1e+10    -1e+10

sudo getbbox main.rad
      xmin      xmax      ymin      ymax      zmin      zmax
   0.37059  0.982963      0.75   1.36237         0       0.5


If the box file is incorporated in the main.rad file such as
!genbox blue_plastic box .5 .5 .5 | xform -rz 15 -t .6 .75 0

then there is no problem with the "getbbox main.rad " running as user.

Other details:

Hi Terrance,

xform searches the RAYPATH variable for its input files.  For some reason, yours doesn't include the current directory "."  Therefore, it will only find "box.rad" if it exists in "/usr/local/lib/ray" and it has permission to reach the file.  If it exists but doesn't have permission, then it will only work if run in super-user mode.

A way around the above problem is always to give the path explicitly, e.g., "./box.rad" instead of "box.rad".  Or, simply include the current directory in your RAYPATH setting first, as is standard:  RAYPATH=".:/usr/local/lib/ray".

I did run a test just to see if sudo would allow "box.rad" to be found in the current directory despite its absence from RAYPATH and it worked just as you say.  I'm rather puzzled by this behavior, actually, so I'll have to investigate further.  In any case, the above fix is the one you want.

Cheers,
-Greg

I figured out what was going on -- apparently, the "sudo" command clears all the user-set environment variables, including RAYPATH.  So, it reverts to the default path that includes "."
