Message-ID: <989437904.81031341236172246.JavaMail.www@wwinf7126>

Hi,
I want to export 3d model from autocad 2007 to radiance, is it possible to export this model and if so, what are the rules to follow when drawing the three-
dimensional model of autocad that easily exported to radiance and how to export it?
If this operation is not possible what are the other compatible software with radiance?
Thank you

Hi Im?ne,

there are several options. One is to write to dxf, which is partially
supported by several converters such as dxf2rad. When modeling, you
should not use solids - besides that, you would need to check for the
specific converter about supported primitives. 3dfaces usually should
work.

Unfortunately there seams to be little to no support for exporting 3d
files in current Autocad releases. In the past there were 3ds and obj,
but both got removed as far as I know. So I would probably choose
another software if possible.

There are export options from almost any 3d modeling tool to obj, which
is very well supported. Can you use Rhino, Blender, Maya, Sketchup, ...?
All these would probably work better.

Cheers, Lars.

Thanks both - I hadn't even considered accessing the manual from the command line. Much better suggestion!

Hi Alex,

I've just updated the pdfs of all manpages (including the compilation pdf at the top) to today's HEAD:
https://radiance-online.lbl.gov:447/learning/documentation/manual-pages/manual-pages

But I recommend Rob's suggestion.  It's much easier to type 'man genskyvec' than it is to get out the binder and flip to the page you need.

Hi all,

I want to download a list of all the Radiance commands to add to my library. The compiled PDFs are dated 1994 and refer to rview not rvu. Is there a more recent compilation of these commands? If not, is there anything else I should be aware of that has changed for the commands?

I also downloaded the man_pages.tar.gz file with all the HTML pages of commands, but as they're separate files printing would be much more tedious. (FYI the original link is broken http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/man_html.tar.gz)

Here is the complete PDF:
http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/manpages.pdf

And here is the rvu manual page dated 2004
http://radiance-online.lbl.gov:82/learning/documentation/manual-pages/pdfs/rvu.pdf

If I'm going to print out 179 pages as an office reference manual, I want to make sure they're the right ones!

Thanks all for the feedback so far. The knowledge contained in this community is fantastic.

Kind regards,
Alex

Lars gave a lot of good suggestions. A couple others, while not strictly
direct-from-AutoCAD solutions:

- Thomas Bleicher's su2rad plugin for SketchUP
(http://code.google.com/p/su2rad/). This will take a SketchUP model and
convert to Radiance, with a GUI for assigning materials. Cameras (views)
are also exported as valid radiance view definitions.

- NREL's OpenStudio (http://openstudio.nrel.gov/). OpenStudio allows you
to build a whole building energy model that can be simulated with
EnergyPlus and Radiance together. You need to build the model in the
OpenStudio SketchUP plugin, but you get an energy model for free in the
deal. 

Both of these tools are free and open source, as well.

Lars already pointed out that AutoCAD is a bit of a closed world. Luckily
you still can download the 3DSOUT tool for the 2007 edition:

http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/ps/dl/item?siteID=123112&id=9481286&linkID=9240618

I used to do exports from AutoCAD regularly and also on quite complex
models. 3DSOUT was able to convert pretty much all ACAD entities to 3D
faces. You will have to do some optimisations on the AutoCAD model to get a
good workflow going, though. The most common approach is to sort elements
with different materials onto separate layers to assign Radiance materials
afterwards.

The 3DS model needs to be converted to Radiance. There are a number of
(free) 3D tools that can read 3DS and write OBJ. OBJ is well supported by
Radiance. Depending on the tools you are going to use you will have to do a
bit off testing to get the details like layering and scale factors right.

Thomas

Hi,

Another possibility is to look at using FBX to get data out of Autocad. 
FBX can then be converted to OBJ using Autodesk's free FBX convert 
application, which can be found here:

    http://usa.autodesk.com/fbx/

However, the challenge may be in how the resulting obj is organized (eg 
grouping of geometry by layer/material...)

Dear Radiance community,

I'm just starting to use Radiance and I'm currently going through the tutorial. Right at the beginning when trying to view the sphere (page 14) using the following command "objline objects/things.rad | x11meta", all I get is a mesh without surfaces and an error saying:

"X connection to /tmp/launch-VcMFzD/org.x:0 broken (explicit kill or server shutdown)."

Now I'm not sure if the mesh is all that I'm in fact supposed to see at this stage but I think that this error message is not a good sign.

Any thoughts on what this could mean and how to solve the problem?

Best regards,
Michael

PS.: I'm running Radiance on Mac OS Snow Leopard using the latest snapshot of Radiance. I followed the installation instructions suggested  here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptTmdKSfK68

Hi Michael, 

objline (redirected to x11meta) would indeed show a wireframe of the model without surfaces. You can use rvu or rpict to render surfaces. You might want to check the manual pages of rvu and rpict to learn how to use them. 

The broken X connection might have nothing to to do with your Radiance install. Have you successfully used other X11 programs? If not, you might want to run another X11 program, if that gives you the same error, or not, we're happy to help you solve it. For example, try to run the 'xclock' or 'xeyes' on your mac's X11 terminal (not terminal), and report to us what's happening. 

My best, 

- iebele

When does this error show in the terminal? While you're still looking at
the mesh or only when you close the window? If it only appears after you
closed the window then that's just because the x11meta window does not
terminate the connection to the x server properly. That's not a problem.

It doesn't look like a problem at this stage. Continue with the tutorial
and see if the following steps produce output you expect.

Thomas

Hi Iebele & Thomas,

Thanks a lot for your help! - I'm running other programs that make use of X11 without problems, e.g., Matlab, Gimp, Freesurfer...

'xclock' and 'xeyes' - quite as promised - gives me a clock and eyes, respectively.

I found some other posts on the web that were unrelated to Radiance mentioning the same error. It appears that it may have something to do with ssh settings. But I'm not remotely connected to any other machine... Just wondering...

@Thomas: Yes, the error only occurred when closing the window. But there was an error beep when the window opened that made me wonder. 

For the time being, I think I will just proceed with the tutorial and assume that this problem does not specifically affect the behavior of Radiance.

Groetjes,
Michael

As mentioned before, while it should not give that warning, there is no
functional problem caused. Objline with x11meta is a way to get a quick
wireframe preview of objects, mostly used for debugging. If you want to
keep those previews e.g. for printout or archiving, you can pipe the
output to psmeta instead. This will hopefully not result in other
problems. And as others mentioned, for shaded previews, you can use rvu
- which is using the raytracing code and allows to use all those
parameters you may set in your final renderings.

The problem is not caused by ssh, as you are working locally.

Cheers, Lars.

Hi Imene

Somewhere within the Radiance src tree, there is a materials file of
typical building materials, including spec and rough. This has been
integrated in the Colour Picker for Radiance which you can find here:
http://www.jaloxa.eu/resources/radiance/colour_picker.shtml
Go Chooser > Building Materials

Multi-coloured materials are trickier and require some cal file. This
can be quite complicated to work out. Carsten Bauer developed some
mindbogglingly complicated examples for granit and other materials.
They were somewhere on his Radzilla web site (which is no longer
actively developed):
http://www.cb-d.de/radzilla.html

Unfortunately, all Radzilla download have been removed because the
code was getting too old. I might still have the Radzilla materials on
my hard disk at home. I shall try to get permission from Carsten and
send them to you, if you like. Please contact me off-list if you are
interested.

Determining spec and rough to any degree of accuracy is nighly
impossible. Your best bet is to do some test renders and compare them
to physical samples of the materials that you are trying to match.

Regards

Axel

Carsten has just reminded me that his fancy materials collection is 
still available on radiance-online.org. He gave a presentation titled 
"Designer's Radiance" at the first Radiance workshop. You can find his 
material here:
http://www.radiance-online.org/radiance-workshop1/cd/Bauer/index.html
Thanks, Carsten!

What you want is the file desradaux.tar which is linked at the very 
bottom of that page.

I also forgot to mention that there are some very simple examples of 
material cal files in my Radiance tutorial, available from this page:
http://www.jaloxa.eu/resources/radiance/documentation/index.shtml

The examples are:
- a blue horizontal stripe across the wall
- random carpet tiles
- dust on the carpet tiles

Those examples are probably a much more accessible starting point than 
Carsten's super complicated granite tiles (which I have never managed to 
fully decipher)

Good luck to you.

Axel

Hi, list,

The "-z" option for falsecolor2.exe seems not available for the Unix
version of "falsecolor2.csh":
https://sites.google.com/site/tbleicher/radiance/falsecolor2

May I ask how to get a falsecolor image with the legend starting from zero
by using falsecolor2.csh under Unix/MacOSX?

Thanks!

There should be no CSH version of falsecolor2. The "2" is there to
distinguish the Python implementation of the old falsecolor CSH script from
the original precisely because there are command line options that are not
available in the original program.

That said, you can use falsecolor2 on any system that provides Python. Mac
OS X comes with Python preinstalled and I don't think there are any
problems with any of the default Python versions. You have to download the
source file from the Google Code repository:

http://code.google.com/p/pyrat/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fwxfalsecolor

You only need the "falsecolor2.py" file for command line operations. It
behaves almost like the CSH original and also provides help if you add a
"-h" to the command line arguments.

Dear group,

I recall seeing a 'pcomb' routine listed here for calculating the  
global illuminance of a HDR scene calculated with  an angular fish-eye  
view (-vta) but now can't seem to find it.  Does anyone have this that  
they would be willing to share?

As always, thanks and best regards.

Hallo Andy,

thank you for your reply.

I looked through the Tutorial you advised about. I realised the generated
results are for one day. In our office we are using the .EPW to generate
the results for the whole year. (as used in the tutorial in rtcontrib). Is
it possible with BSDF somehow? if yes, Is there any hints or tips to insert
the .xml format generated by window7beta into the rtcontrib process?

Thanks in advance!

and when I run ra in Terminal, i am getting the following:

*oconv: fatal - (material.rad): unknown type "BSDF"*


I guess the material bsdf is missing in my list, anyone can advise?

thx in advance

Message-ID: <1342091472.46362.YahooMailNeo@web161605.mail.bf1.yahoo.com>

Dear All,?

I wanted to ask a question related to the prediction of the diffuse horizontal (or vertical contribution) of a particular patch of the sky ( with a specific patch altitude, solid angle, patch azimuth).?

I am developing a patch-based Irradiance model and I wanted to compare with other models in Radiance , e.g.Perez Model. I know How to calculate the diffuse horizontal, or any titled surface of the whole sky, but in my case I wanted to compare in a patch-based mode. So I need to simulate a patch-based contribution of diffuse component in horizontal or any titled surface.?

I thank you in advance,?


Regards,?

Sokol?

My guess is that you don't have the latest version of Radiance.  If "rtrace -version" doesn't return "RADIANCE 4.1" or later, then  you need to download more recent binaries or recompile from source.  Rob Guglielmetti just posted the locations of binaries for various systems.  You should grab one of those.

Best,
-Greg

Hi Sokol,

If you are OK using a Tregenza (or Reinhart) sky subdivision, then you can use rtcontrib to compute all the patch contributions at once.  A complete explanation of the process is provided in Axel Jacobs' tutorial, with additional methods for handling BSDFs described by Andy McNeil.

Axel's tutorial:	http://tinyurl.com/884plcj

Andy's tutorial:	http://docs.google.com/View?id=dfjk2vdh_79ff7nxwgq

Hopefully,  you can figure it out from these, but feel free to ask more specific questions.

Best,
-Greg

Hey Rob,

What a coincidence as I was just downloading and installing openstudio 
today... So I assume the radiance binaries are as of today rather than 
May 16?

Hi Jack,

Good timing. Yeah, the updated packages were pushed up to the site last
night, so you have the new ones. I updated the datestamp on the page
this morning. The packages were actually made July 2, just took a while
to get 'em posted. =)

Let me know how you like OpenStudio!

You could try OpenStudio for this; we have a simple implementation of the three phase method currently working with Window6 BSDF files. I'm still working on documentation, but I could help you along offline, if interested.

Hallo Andy,

thank you for your reply.

I looked through the Tutorial you advised about. I realised the generated results are for one day. In our office we are using the .EPW to generate the results for the whole year. (as used in the tutorial in rtcontrib). Is it possible with BSDF somehow? if yes, Is there any hints or tips to insert the .xml format generated by window7beta into the rtcontrib process?

Thanks in advance!

Hi Nasif,

Information for the BSDF material is at the bottom of page 12:
http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/refman.pdf

Though I've found that the BSDF material doesn't work well for
daylight coefficient based annual simulations (I'm assuming dds.bash is a
dynamic daylight simulation script).  Putting the solar radiance into
skypatches relies on probabilistic sampling to find patches containing the
sun, and if you don't have much direct transmission from the direction of
the sun, you aren't likely to find the sun.  Not finding the sun causes big
errors.  For now, the three-phase method is a better alternative for annual
simulation of BSDF materials (you can find a tutorial at the bottom of this
page: http://www.radiance-online.org:82/learning/tutorials - if you're at
work, your company's firewall might block access to port 82 - the temporary
location of the new radiance online).

Andy

Hi Nassif,
Data in the BSDF isn't specific to a date or time, so yes it is possible to
do an annual simulation with the xml file from window.

There are two official options and one un-official option:

1 - As Rob mentioned, you can use OpenStudio which does a lot of this for
you.

2 - you can loop through hours of the weather data file. Following is a
bash/awk example (add your weather data file at the end and include -a -o
and -m in the gensky and gendaylit command):
count=-8
while read line ; do
count=$((count+1))
if [ count -gt 0 ] ; then
daytime=`echo $line | awk -F, '{print $2,$3,$4-0.5}'`
alt=`gensky $daytime  | awk '{if(NR==3) print $6}'
if [ alt -gt 2 ]; then
dir=`echo $line | awk -F, '{print $14}'`
dif=`echo $line | awk -F, '{print $15}'`
gendaylit $daytime -W $dir $dif | genskyvec | dctimestep V.vmx T.xml D.dmx
>> output_$count.txt
fi
fi
done < myweather.epw

3 - Unofficial - you can use our annual utility (dctimestepcpu) that takes
a sky matrix file (list of annual sky vectors) and multiplies a whole year
in one go.  Let me know if you want to go this route, I can send you the
code for you to compile on your system.  This isn't a straight forward
compile process though, it may require some tweaking on your end.

Hi Sokol,

If you are OK using a Tregenza (or Reinhart) sky subdivision, then you can use rtcontrib to compute all the patch contributions at once.? A complete explanation of the process is provided in Axel Jacobs' tutorial, with additional methods for handling BSDFs described by Andy McNeil.

Axel's tutorial:??? http://tinyurl.com/884plcj

Andy's tutorial:??? http://docs.google.com/View?id=dfjk2vdh_79ff7nxwgq

Hopefully,? you can figure it out from these, but feel free to ask more specific questions.

Best,
-Greg

Message-ID: <6622326.67341342185135235.JavaMail.www@wwinf7118>

Hi ,
materials are defined in radiance by their RGB colors and by their specularity and roughness. I'm trying to test different materials given in radiance tutorial and I have a question about metal2 rolled_aluminium defined :
void metal2 rolled_aluminium
4 0 0 1 .
0
6 .31 .31 .31 .68 .04 .09
what is the signification of the first line : 4 0 0 1 . ? What can we put in the second line defined in this example by 0
Why do we define 6 arguments and not 5 in the last line and what is .09 
If i want to test this material in colour picker for radiance given in this site : http://www.jaloxa.eu/resources/radiance/colour_picker/index.shtml
where can I write the arguments of the first line ?
thanks,
Im?ne SLAMA

The Radiance material specifications are explained in the Radiance
Reference Manual:
http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/refman.pdf

The metal2 material has anisotropic roughness. The direction of the
anisotrophy is defined by the vector in the 2nd line (0 0 1). The
urough and vrough values (0.04 and 0.09) define the roughness
perpendicular to the roughness vector.
See 'plastc2' on p7 and 'metal2' on p8 of the Reference manual.

The Jaloxa colour picker only supports 'plastic' and 'metal'. Sorry.

Hi,
concerning values for specularity and roughness from measured scattering 
data, you might find
  http://www.pab.eu/gonio-photometer/demodata/bme/ useful.
It gives numbers of both for some materials. They depend on incident 
direction for most materials, but that's actually a problem of the model 
rather of the materials and their data.

    Hi,
    Do you khow any websites that gives many examples of materials defined by their roughness and specularity fractions and RGB reflectance (examples carpet, mdf, aluminium, marble....) ? how can we choose the RGB colors in radiance when we have multicolor mat?rial like carpet?

Hi Christoph,

Just fyi, I expressed interest in the Radiance interest group and somehow  got promoted to group leader for the kick-off event on Wednesday. The format seems pretty open ended at the moment. I was thinking of spending a few minutes introducing Radiance and perhaps dynamic simulation and advanced materials. From there the guidance seems to be to discussion and identification of issues and topics for future meetings. This being said if there is someone who would be interested in doing a brief demo of Diva this could be good. Or if there are other local Radiance users with possible topics please let me know.

Best,

-Jack

Hallo,

what is the best parameters for dds.bash when using BSDF materials?

Well, I am testing a simple room with BSDF material ( which i obtained
using windows7beta); but the results are not convincing. it ranges +-20 %
from what i was expecting.




N.B: the parameters i used before for my annual simulations is:

*rtc="-ad 8192 -lw 2e-12 -n $cores" # render-options *( and it works
perfectly with glas material)
*
*
thx for your support

Subject: [Radiance-general] Python script
Message-ID: <op.whjap11j7lwvrx@localhost>

Hi all.
I am about to release version 0.2 of a set of python scripts that  
pre/post-process Radiance scenes from a 3D modelling package called  
Blender. I have implemented Dynamic Daylight Simulations in version 0.2,  
which is fine on Linux/Mac but it's causing me a problem on windows  
machines. When python, using Popen, sends out the command piping gendaylit  
to genskyvec.pl I get a bad sky description error, although if I type the  
same command into the Windows command prompt it works as expected. Has  
anyone here got any experience of running this combination on windows with  
Python. I'm using strawberry Perl to run the genskyvec.pl file, which was  
part of NREL's latest binary release.
Thanks in advance

Ryan

Hi Ryan.

Interesting that Blender is coming back to Radiance. I am following the
Python API development but I'm still not sure it has all the bells and
whistles to make it worth the effort.

Regarding your Popen problem: Do you have problems with other Perl scripts
as well or is it only genskyvec.pl?

I do remember that I had some issues with command lines and Popen on
Windows when I was writing falsecolor2. It's mostly the correct quoting of
the arguments. I don't recall doing anything specific that solved my
problem, though.

Can you test your code outside of Blender in plain Python or do you have
too many dependencies on the Blender modules?

Regards,
Thomas

Message-ID: <6385175.72281342448119177.JavaMail.www@wwinf7108>

Hi community,
when we create an object in radiance software, for example : simple chair. How can we put it in the room in a specific location? I know, you will tell me that xform is a command that allows this funtion. The problems is that i used xform for the design of the chair itself and it's a bit difficult to use it again to move each element of the chair in the desired location. Is there a command in radiance to create a block called chair ?It will be easy after this to use xform to move the bloc chair in the desired location.
Thank you
Im?ne

Can you save the geometry of the chair in its own .rad file with an appropriate origin point at the center or corner of the chair extents? Then in your overall scene you can include as many lines as you like to repeat the chair such as:

### full scene rad file

#rest of your scene
materialname polygon name
0 0 4 ...
[other scene geometry]

# one instance of chair moved one unit in x direction
!xform -t 1 0 0 chair.rad
# another instance of chair moved one unit in y direction after rotating it 90deg
!xform -rz 90 -t 0 1 0 chair.rad
# a 2x2 array of chairs after starting 2 units in the y direction
!xform -t 0 2 0 -a 2 -t 0 1 0 -a 2 -t 1 0 0 chair.rad

#rest of scene
[other scene geometry]

Hi Imene,

There are several way to accomplish this. If we assume that you have a 
separate file for your chair object called "simple_chair.rad" with its 
origin at the lowest point midway between the front legs and facing 
along positive X (for example), here are a few ways to place the chair 
or multiple copies of the chair in your scene.

In a new file called "scene_chairs.rad" you could use  xform as follows:

    !xform -rz 90 -t 10 0 0 simple_chair.rad
    !xform -rz 270 -t 10 5 0 simple_chair.rad

This should place two chairs (simple_chair.rad) 5 units apart from each 
other in Y located 10 units from the origin in X.

However if you are going to do lots of repeated instances of the chair, 
it would be better to use real octree instances as these will save on 
memory. To do this you need to do the following:

Step 1: compile the chair object into a frozen octree - assumes that the 
materials are in a separate file

        oconv -f mats.simple_chair.rad simple_chair.rad > simple_chair.oct

        NOTE that this creates what is known as a "frozen" octree which
        basically means that the materials and geometry are all compiled
        together and changes to any of the base rad files will NOT
        effect the octree....

Step 2: create a file called - "simple_chair.instance.rad" and input the 
following

        void instance my_simple_chair_instance
        7 simple_chair.oct -s 1.0 -t 0.0 0.0 0.0
        0
        0

Step 3: place your chair object (for example in scene_chairs.rad):

    !xform -rz 90 -t 10 0 0 -a 20 -t 2.5 0 0 simple_chair.instance.rad
    !xform -rz 270 -t 10 5 0 -a 20 -t 2.5 0 0 simple_chair.instance.rad

assuming that I did this correctly this would create 2 rows (offset by 
10 units in X from the origin) of 20 chairs each facing each other at a 
distance of 5 units in Y.

I hope this helps.

Thanks Thomas.
The API is pretty complete now but still changes due to evolving Blender  
functionality. I have to do quite a bit to port my scripts to the 2.63  
BMesh version for example. genskyvec.pl works when I simply type the  
command sequence into the windows terminal, it just seems that when  
executing the command sequence with Popen the data from gendaylit is not  
correctly understood by genskyvec.pl. Running simply within Python is a  
good idea, I'll try that.

Hi community,
In radiance tutorial, for simulation of daylighting, we must create a file named sky.rad and an other file named sky_overcast.mat. But I can't find a description of the second file, I mean sky_overcast.mat. I know that is a material for an overcast sky but what should we write to define this file? Please, can you gives me an example?

I don't know which tutorial you refere to but I think that the general idea
is to separate the scene elements that create the sky from the description
that defines the actual sky condition.

In Radiance you first have to define a "material" for a scene element and
then you apply this material to a geometric object like a polygone or a
disk. For the sky description there is a special type of geometry which is
called "source". This is, I expect, what you use in the sky.rad file in
your tutorial.

You can read the man page for gensky to get an idea of how the program is
typically used. About half way through there is an example of a complete
sky description (it starts with "!gensky 4 1 14"). Compare this with the
contents of your sky.rad file and the lines before need to go into the
sky.rad file. This may only be the "!gensky ..." line or this line and the
following "skyfunc ..." definition.

When you use this now in a scene you first add the sky_overcast.mat and
then the sky.rad file to an oconv command line to compile the octree for
the scene. When you want to use the same scene under different sky
conditions you only need to replace the sky_overcast.mat file with another
one which contains a different "!gensky ..." command to create an
intermediate or sunny sky.

That's what I thought. I think I can wait a bit longer for it to stabilise.

You can also hack the genskyvec.pl script and add a line to print out the
input that the script actually gets. If this is not what you expect it to
be then you have to look at your use of Popen again.

Hi Imene, 

I don't know which tutorial you use. 

A very basic way to create an overcast sky at june 21 at 13.00 would be like:

iep at login4:~/projecten/PHB$ gensky 6 21 13  -c   > sky.mat 

This would add the following lines to the file sky .mat:

# gensky 6 21 13 -c
# Local solar time: 12.84
# Solar altitude and azimuth: 72.0 40.5
# Ground ambient level: 31.8

void brightfunc skyfunc
2 skybr skybright.cal
0
3 2 4.09e+01 6.36e+00


Now you can edit yourself a sky description file for the upper hemisphere. Create a file sky_overcast.mat and add these lines:


skyfunc  glow sky_mat
0
0
4
1 1 1   0

sky_mat source sky
0
0
4     0 0 1 180

This is very basic, but gives you the idea.

Hope this helps,

Just to add to Jack's and Thomas' replies to your question (I'm assuming 
you're using a UNIX version of Radiance). You're probably wondering now 
how this view file was created in the first place.

If you run
$ rvu scene.oct
the interactive Radiance scene viewer rvu is launched with your scene in 
it. BTW: If you are reading some VERY old documentation which is still 
out there on the Internet, the command would be 'rview', not 'rvu'. You 
can now use the command prompt at the bottom of the rvu window to move 
the camera around. A list of the most useful rvu commands is in the 
table on p18 of the Tutorial. Apart from 'aim', which is always handy, 
the commands I use most often are:

- when inside a room: 'rotate'
- when looking from the outside: 'pivot'

The tricky bit is always to get the view point right. If you are inside 
a room, a good starting point is to identify a good view point (think 
tripod and camera) by looking at your plan and elevations/sections 
which, of course, you have at least as scribble on a bit of paper.

For external views, a good start is to first run
$ objview scene.mat scene.rad etc

objview takes the material and scene files, adds a few light sources, 
compiles an octree, and then calls rvu. Now use 'pivot' (and the other 
rvu commands to move around the model. Once you have a good view, save 
it like this from the rvu prompt:
: view views/nice.vf
: q

You can now run rvu to look at the scene under your proper light 
sources, rather than the ones objview puts in:
$ rvu -vf views/nice.vf scene.oct

Or, you can run
$ rvu scene.oct
and
: last views/nice.vf

Hope this helps

Regards

Axel

Just to add to Axel's addition, I recently ported objview from csh to Ruby
so that Windows users can have access to this rather useful utility. I
also added in the old 'ltview' (luminaire viewer) functionality that I
wrote many years ago, which was simply a modified version of objview. It's
sitting on a far back burner and just needs some more testing. The hope is
it can be added to the Radiance source tree and built into the NREL
installers, but failing that we'll just offer it as a download on the
OpenStudio website when it's done. If anyone wants to beat on it, I can
send you a copy offline for now.

Hi Ryan.

Interesting that Blender is coming back to Radiance. I am following the Python API development but I'm still not sure it has all the bells and whistles to make it worth the effort.

Regarding your Popen problem: Do you have problems with other Perl scripts as well or is it only genskyvec.pl<http://genskyvec.pl>?

This is happening with our Ruby scripts as well?

I do remember that I had some issues with command lines and Popen on Windows when I was writing falsecolor2. It's mostly the correct quoting of the arguments. I don't recall doing anything specific that solved my problem, though.

?I will look at the quotes.

Hi all.
I am about to release version 0.2 of a set of python scripts that pre/post-process Radiance scenes from a 3D modelling package called Blender. I have implemented Dynamic Daylight Simulations in version 0.2, which is fine on Linux/Mac but it's causing me a problem on windows machines. When python, using Popen, sends out the command piping gendaylit to genskyvec.pl<http://genskyvec.pl> I get a bad sky description error, although if I type the same command into the Windows command prompt it works as expected. Has anyone here got any experience of running this combination on windows with Python. I'm using strawberry Perl to run the genskyvec.pl<http://genskyvec.pl> file, which was part of NREL's latest binary release.
Thanks in advance

Ryan, thanks for reporting this. I think we are probably both in the same boat, and it's preventing Windows OpenStudio users to do a full annual simulation with our Radiance implementation scripts too. We are looking into a fix right now.

Looked at this a bit this morning, and actually I can't get the correct behavior from Genskyvec on Windows even using the program directly. A really simple example:

C:\gensky 6 21 12 | genskyvec.pl -m 1
Bad sky description!

Gensky prints a valid description to STDOUT, but when I pipe it to genskyvec, it fails the error check loop in lines 25-45. I'm using v 2.8 of genskyvec.pl, from 2012.06.28. Ideas?

Hi Rob,

I can't test it for you, but I suspect the line:

	} elsif (/\sskyfunc\s*$/) {

is the problem.  Try removing the final '\s*' to make it:

	} elsif (/\sskyfunc$/) {

and see if that works.  It works on Unix, so if it solves the problem, I should check it in.  I don't know why it would be an issue, but I can't see what else could be failing.

Hi Greg,

That change didn't help on WinXP. BTW, the script runs fine on Windows7,
with both versions of that line. I'll see if anyone around here knows
what's up.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Problem whith file.oct
Message-ID: <1003033115.92781342685540305.JavaMail.www@wwinf7111>

Hi community
I want to make a file named scene.oct. So I create geometries : room.rad, chair.rad, table.rad. In the end of the file room.rad, I wrote:
!xform -t 1 1.5 0 chair.rad
!xform -t 1.5 1.5 0 table.rad
to put the chair and the table in desired place in the room
So When I wrote : objline objects/room.rad |x11meta, I saw the room with chair and table in desired place but when i wrote :
oconv materials/course.mat skies/sky.rad objects/room.rad > scene.oct
I get this message :
xform: cannot find file "chair.rad"
oconv: warning - (| xform -t 1 1.5 0 chair.rad): empty file
xform : cannot find file "table.rad"
oconv: warning - (| xform -t 1.5 1.5 0 table.rad) : empty file
I don't understand why did i have this message? knowing that I put all geometries (chair.rad, table.rad and room.rad) in the same file named objects. when the room is without furnitre, i can make easily a sene.oct but when i have furniture like chair and table, i can't make this
Please can someone explain me how to resolve this problem? 
Thank you
Im?ne

Radiance is using an environment variable called RAYPATH to know which 
directories to use when searching for files. This allows to use library 
folders. If you want to make sure that the current directory is searched 
for files, add a dot (which represents the current directory) to your 
RAYPATH:

export RAYPATH=$RAYPATH:.

This is the syntax for the bash shell, other environments may have 
different ways to set an environment variable.

Once you have a complex scene, adding some directories may help. I 
usually have e.g. subdirectories called mat, sky, scene, objects, and 
would add all of them to the RAYPATH.

Cheers, Lars.

Hi Im?ne,

I would propose to have a look at Axel's unix tutorial for Radiance 
users. You can append directories to the PATH (or RAYPATH) variable 
using colons, in bash, the syntax would be:

export RAYPATH=$RAYPATH:newsubdir:anothersubdir:currentdir

What happens is that the variable RAYPATH (left hand) is set to the 
string on the right hand. That string is consisting of the current 
content of RAYPATH (that is why you place the $ at its beginning) plus 
the remaining line. The colon is used as a separator for directories.

The syntax is the same as for other environment variables. The most 
popular example would be the PATH variable, which is the search 
directory for executable (program) files.

Environment variables are kept while you keep a session, e.g. a terminal 
window, open. If you want the changes to be permament, you can use your 
shell's configuration file. For bash, that would be e.g. .bashrc (a 
hidden file in your home directory). I tend to set the RAYPATH at the 
beginning of a simple script, which than calls rad. There are many 
options, again Axel's tutorial is probably a good starting point.

Cheers, Lars.

Hi Imene

The RAYPATH environment variable tells the Radiance binaries where to
search for files if they can't be found in the current directory. In your
case with the command

!xform -t 1 1.5 0 chair.rad

Radiance expects the file "chair.rad" in the current directory, that is the
directory where you issue the "oconv" command. Since you have the chair.rad
and table.rad files in a subdirectory called "objects" you should use the
following line to place your scene elements:

!xform -t 1 1.5 0 objects/chair.rad

Try this first before you start to fiddle with the RAYPATH variable.

BTW: A common way to organize your scene files is to keep all your geometry
in a "objects" directory (and optionally a "skies" directory for sky files
and so on). Then you create a single file "scene.rad" that only references
the files in the "objects" directory via "!xform" commands:

!xform materials.rad
!xform skies/sunny_sky.rad

!xform objects/room.rad
!xform -t 1 1.5 0 objects/chair.rad
!xform -t 1.5 1.5 0 objects/table.rad


Then you only need the command

oconv scene.rad > scene.oct

to create the octree file. If you want a differente scene you just copy the
scene.rad file and add or remove whichever geometry you want to change.

Regards
Thomas

I haven't been Jia. I can give it a go if you think it will help, but it  
is not required on OSX/linux.
As running a perl script from a python script smacks of a certain  
inefficiency I might try and recode genskyvec into python. If anyone has a  
link to info about what genskyvec is doing, or an idiot's guide to perl  
for that matter, I'd love to hear from you.

Ryan,

I'm not sure how inefficient that is, the overhead of an additional
interpreter is trivial these days. For info about what genskyvec is doing,
you should start with the man page, and then simply read the Perl code.
But I'd advise against a full rewrite; I think we just need to figure out
what the problem is with the Perl script. We have found that Genskyvec
fails on multiple XP machines, all running ActiveState Perl. I will try
Strawberry Perl next, but I know I'm grasping at straws here.

I played around with the script this morning and found that genskyvec
doesn't receive any input via the pipe on Windows XP. I googled around a
bit and it seems that this is a limitation of cmd.exe on Windows XP. Vista
and newer seem to work (just relying on Google here, did not test it
myself.) Some information can be found here:

http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=859261

As a work around you can specify the command as

gensky 3 21 12 | perl -S genskyvec.pl

This at least solves the problem of the empty pipe. It should work in a
Python Popen command, too.

Regards,
Thomas

Hi Thomas,

Thanks for the research! Unfortunately, this workaround resulted in this mess:

Hmmm?

C:\>gensky 6 21 12 | perl -S genskyvec.pl -m 1
Access is denied.

I think I had the same error during testing. After I set RAYPATH to the lib
folder in the new installation it worked fine. Is your RAYPATH set
correctly at the cmd prompt? I also did not use any arguments like "-m 1"
for testing.

I can't remember if I replied to this or not. I am old.

Anyway, Thomas, RAYPATH is indeed set correctly. We are considering dropping support for WindowsXP at this point, seeing as how it's almost as old as I am, and these scripts work fine on Windows7 (soon to be supplanted by Windows8). The reason I replied to the list is because I'm curious:

Is anyone running Radiance on WindowsXP anymore? Email me offlist (robert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov) if you have a sec, listers. Just trying to get a sense of how many XP/Radiance users are out there.

I think I had the same error during testing. After I set RAYPATH to the lib folder in the new installation it worked fine. Is your RAYPATH set correctly at the cmd prompt? I also did not use any arguments like "-m 1" for testing.

Hi Thomas,

Thanks for the research! Unfortunately, this workaround resulted in this mess:

Message-ID: <500DD845.90609@ise.fraunhofer.de>

Hi all,

I just encountered a strange different behavior between rtrace and rpict:
If the sun ( using "source") is  covered in large parts (in that case 
more than half) I can still "see" the uncovered parts in the image 
(=>this is what I expect). In case I calculate at the same point and in 
the same direction the illuminance with rtrace -I, I get zero 
contribution.  Is just the center of the source description tested in 
that case? Any solution for this for rtrace?
I just look for the sun, no sky description and use only direct 
calculation (-ab 0) .

Thanks,

Jan

Jan,
maybe you can fix it with -dj and oversampling?

hi giulio,

Yes!
The use of -dj helped, but only if I use also the -u option. Otherwise I 
still get randomized zero values, also if I change -ds.

thanks!

Hi Giulio, hi all,

unfortunately it doesn't work out safely. In total I have many, many 
cases to look at (in total 40000 timesteps x 33 points x 2geometries) 
and there are still many cases, when rtrace doesn't catch the sun.
Since these are calculations for an expertise, which is used for a 
trial, I have to be absolutely sure not to miss any case...

Is there any idea except calculating images ? Source subdivisions are 
unfortunately not possible when "source" is used...

Thanks!

Jan

but did you try to oversample?
let's say run 100 times and get the average at each point?

Alternatively there is another option.
derive illuminance from a standard image.
so:
render what a calculation point sees in view -h mode
then write a script to process the luminance data and the angular location alongside the solid angle of a single pixel.
the total contribution, the sum, would be the total illuminance, regardless of any subdivision etc.
but it takes 1 image for each point and you may need to investigate the resolution required to capture all sources (if small)?
we have done this before (Andy,remember?) and it works quite well.
In fact the method can be extended to calculate reflections and caustics...
Good luck with the judge!

Hi Giulio,

thanks!

Both solutions are a question of calculation time... but I use the 
second way now to be on the safe side (calculation of image) - even it 
takes me much longer...For the evaluation I use evalglare, is pretty 
simple to use for such cases.

For reflections I already did it in that way and I used a modified 
version of evalglare (will put it online soon) to calculate the angle 
between different glare sources (in that case between reflection and 
sun), too. The only disadvantage is the long calculation time of several 
days (1 image (ab0)+evaluation takes 6 sec -> 2.5 days on a single core 
for one point..and I have 33 points and two geometries...).

Hi Andy, hi list-subscribers,

I just came across this recent message about the usability of the bsdf
material type with patch-based models of the sky including direct sun
and complex fenestration. To avoid misunderstandings, I will try a short
summary for others to comment on available options for annual
simulations with complex glazing:


1) classic radiance tools (rpict, rtrace), complemented by mkillum to
relax ambient setting.

Advantages: low noise, validated.

Disadvantages: very slow for annual simulations, no support when
non-planar specular reflective surfaces are involved.


2) rtcontrib and patch-based model.

Advantages: faster for annual simulations.

Disadvantages: noise, nice images require high (slow) -ad and cannot be
optimized using mkillum, limitations about specular non-planar
reflectors apply.


3) rtcontrib and patch-based model, bsdf.

Advantages: support for non-planar reflectors, should be slightly faster
then 2) as the fenestration system does not have to be traces internally
- did anyone compare?

Disadvantages: still high -ad settings required leading to extended
rendering times and still no way to get mkillum in, tends to
underestimate direct sun (according Andy's message).


4) three-phase-method.

Advantages: very fast, can also be used with non-planar specular
reflectors as bsdf data is supported.

Disadvantages: requires quite a lot of set-up work, e.g. subdivisions to
reflect external obstructions. Patches visible in the results,
fenestration geometry is not visible.


5) pmap.

Advantages: can be used with non-planar reflectors and multi-peak
transmission.

Disadvantages: unknown status (any news?), not integrated with rtcontrib
(contributions would need to be rendered manually).


So if I need a way to generate images with visible fenestration
geometry, the only reliable option would be 2), which requires very
hight settings for -ad and thud will still be rather time-consuming, if
noise is to be controlled.

Cheers, Lars.

You could get the direction of the sun from your sky description and point
rtrace in that direction and only get the material (-om). You can add your
own variations to sample the whole disc to calculate the visible part of
the sun if that's what you need.

Hi Lars,

Andy probably is the right person to respond to this, but as he's on a vacation until the end of the month, I thought I'd offer a couple of comments (inline).

Cheers,

More specifically, non-planar, specular reflectors run into trouble for insolation.  Cloudy skies or sunless skies are no problem.

The accuracy of non-planar, specular reflectors is actually better than #1, but the results are somewhat noisy.  A new -c option to vwrays (coupled with the rtcontrib -c option) is a good way to reduce noise that is available in the latest HEAD.  This is a better way to reduce noise than increasing -ad, and less costly.

Andy has proposed an improved annual simulation method, which we hope to work on next year, to remedy the direct solar sampling difficulties in the 3-phase method.  It should also alleviate problems with external facade geometry and reduce the need to subdivide windows.

Message-ID: <CC35907F.12D36%robert.guglielmetti@nrel.gov>

Well, it looks like WindowsXP isn't the only problem. While genskyvec.pl
works fine with piped input from the command line on Windows7, when it's
called from within my Ruby script, I get the same error that Ryan Southall
reported with his Python script
(http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-July/008758
.html). 

Greg, I tried your suggestion again as well:

...but no luck. 

Ryan, have you made any more progress with this issue? Anyone else?
Bueller?

Hi.
I can confirm that Thomas' suggestion to use prepend genskyvec.pl with  
'perl -S' appears to work on a windows 7 machine when run from a Python  
script. I have not tested numerical correspondence with OSX/linux yet as I  
am still going through the remainder of my code to get it to work with the  
windows command line (a process which is very much like extracting one's  
own teeth).

Dear Greg,
   Thank you for letting us know about the -c option.  I am going to try 
it with rtcontrib (sensors) and wanted to ask for advice on how to setup 
the points for averaging.  For example, if I choose 4 for -c, do I send 
in the same point 4 times or is there a heuristic for perturbing or 
regularly spacing these points for improving results?
   Thanks for creating this feature!

- Dan

Yeah, this is a nice feature that obviates the need for oversampling to
reduce image noise in many cases. This feature is in the NREL packages,
BTW.

Hi Dan,

If you want your sensors averaged over some small area (rather than measured at a point), then you can jitter the sample location.  Otherwise, just repeat the point value N times corresponding to your -c argument.

Subject: [Radiance-general] ies2rad calculation
Message-ID: <50108631.1030407@gmx.de>

Hi,

I try to understand how the ies2rad programm works, but I don't get it. 
The calculation of the three color channels in the description of 
material light  is unclear.

the lamp color (fluorescent ) is .373 .385 .85
http://www.radiance-online.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/ray/src/cv/lamp.tab?revision=2.3&view=markup

lamp radiance for every channel = lumens/area/(WHTEFFICACY*PI) * lampcolor
area = 4*PI*r^2
WHTEFFICACY = 179
http://www.radiance-online.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/ray/src/cv/lampcolor.c?revision=2.10&view=markup

This value 1.27324e+06 from my example is the inverse projected area of 
the sphere (1/(PI*r^2))

But where are this 0.907945 0.863233 0.476189 values from? This 
calculation (lumens/area/(WHTEFFICACY*PI) * lampcolor) doesn't match.

This is my example:

ies2rad -dm -t fluorescent Test.ies

Hi Rob,

The color values in the lamp.tab file are in CIE x & y plus depreciation factor (Y).  You can't just multiply this as if it is RGB.  You would have to convert to Radiance RGB first using src/cal/cal/xyz_rgb.cal like so:

rcalc -f xyz_rgb.cal -e 'myX=myx/myy*myY;myZ=(1-myx-myy)/myy*myY' -e 'myx=$1;myy=$2;myY=$3' \
	-e '$1=R(myX,myY,myZ);$2=G(myX,myY,myZ);$3=B(myX,myY,myZ)'

You would then input the xyY values from the lamp.tab file on stdin.  When I do this for your example, I get:

0.907836401	0.863244138	0.476356636

As you can see, these are exactly the RGB values that appear in the file.

Best,
-Greg

Have you tried to print out the lines that are actually processed by
genskyvec when it is running? The "validation" in the above code is very
basic and will also fail if genskyvec does not receive any input at all.

Here is a link to a MS KB that affects STDIN of scripts (it's very old,
though):

http://support.microsoft.com/kb/321788

I don't know if genskyvec can read from a file but you could add this
feature if necessary and use a temporary file to store your sky
description. Then use genskyvec in a second subprocess to read and process
the file.

Yup. Genskyvec.pl is indeed not getting anything when the full command chain is called. For example, this (Ruby) code:

tempIO = IO.popen("gendaylit -ang #{tsSolarAlt} #{tsSolarAzi} -L #{tsDirectNormIllum} #{tsDiffuseHorIllum}")
illumTemp = tempIO.readlines.to_s
tempIO.close
puts "illumTemp: #{illumTemp}"

?at runtime, prints the gendaylit output. But this code:

tempIO = IO.popen("gendaylit -ang #{tsSolarAlt} #{tsSolarAzi} -L #{tsDirectNormIllum} #{tsDiffuseHorIllum} | genskyvec#{perlExtension} -m 1 | dctimestep ./output/dc/#{space_name}/maps/#{space_name}_map.dmx | rcalc -e #{vLambda}")
illumTemp = tempIO.readlines.to_s
tempIO.close
puts "illumTemp: #{illumTemp}"

?at runtime, prints nothing. I had exactly the same thought of modifying genskyvec.pl to accept a file as input but I'd like to avoid the extra file I/O. I hope to have time to look at this some more today. Thanks for the input!

Hi Greg,
   For a preliminary trial, I passed in the same point 4 and 16 times 
and saw the smoothing.  Thank you for incorporating this directly into 
these utilities!

Hi Everyone,

Hey Dan,

I think Andy said he planned to offer links to the NREL stuff, no reason why he couldn't offer up links to other projects like Daysim, Thomas' stuff, Aksel's stuff, Zack's stuff, and other stuff. The site is very much a labor of love, and is totally unfunded; Andy's been doing this work largely on his own dime. AFAIK, it's still the only planned centralized Radiance site. It'd be nice if it were implemented in something like Drupal, which would make it easy for collaboration on the site's content but I'm not sure how that would work with LBL. I know here at NREL that becomes a headache (managing collaboration with outside sources), which is why I wouldn't offer taking up such a project! I'm happy to say that it looks like we will receive funding to continue to maintain the Radiance binary offerings we do have, at least through FY13.  =8-)

Hi Rob - 

well I don't know if you got the announcement emails awhile back 

http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-March/008454.html

but it is very much setup to support collaborative authoring as it is considered a community site with designated moderators  - so we are encouraging contributions ;-)

I guess all that needs to be done on my side is to make the site default instead of the legacy site which will perhaps force us to make the information more presentable...

Other than that its "ready to go"

Dan

D'oh, you're right Danny, sorry I forgot about your post. That's great! I
unfortunately can't view the site from work in its current state because
that port is blocked by NREL's firewall. Maybe when Andy gets back from
vacation we can talk about how the community can help. ?

Hi Dan, in the latest SPOT v4.2 release I compiled all the python code to
avoid issues installing Python and version compatibility.  You can download
the old SPOT v4.0 which still includes all python source code here:

http://www.archenergy.com/SPOT/_download-SPOT_v4.0.html

Soon, all this will be hosted on a different site - I will post when that
happens.

Cheers,
Zack

Hi Greg,

thank you for the reply. I tried a bit since, so it is almost one week
later that I can report on what I experienced so far.

Classical Radiance scenes with both "light" and "glow" sources used to
require high settings of -ad to generate "noiseless" images. This led to
something like, say, -ab 4 -ad 1024 -as 512. This was typically
impossible to render, so mkillum was used to smooth out the ambient
transmission through fenestration and keep the sharp transmission
distribution only in the direct calculation. The ambient settings would
be released to e.g. -ab 2 -ad 256 -as 128 - fast and noise-reduced.

With rtcontrib, we typically have no "light" sources any more,
everything is "glow". At the same time, mkillum is not available as a
tool any more.

It is possible to reduce the amount of rays spawned at any ambient
bounce by not increasing -ad but -c and having the jitter smooth out the
distributions from different sky patches instead. This means that
additional rays are spawned only at the first level (direct) but not for
daughter rays. However it reduces only the direct noise - noise in e.g.
shadow patterns for the patches representing the direct sun. Noise for
areas lid only by indirect, diffuse reflected light e.g. in the back of
the room is not reduced.

My guess is that the -c option aims at the same strategy as what Mark
Stock found to be promising for scenes with a lot of geometry and many
ambient bounces:

http://markjstock.org/radmisc/aa0_ps1_test/final.html

What is the actual advantage of using -c 4 instead of doubling x- and
y-resolution?

Cheers, Lars.

Actually, "light" still does something in rtcontrib by attracting sample rays.  It isn't always an improvement, however.  The "light" type is best reserved for actual luminaires and the like -- this is what Andy found in his experiments if I remember right.

Actually, all noise should be reduced somewhat.

Yes, I think so.  The main advantage of increasing -c as opposed to -x and -y is efficiency -- the output picture files are smaller, so you don't have as much disk i/o (which can be a bottleneck) and don't have to filter the results, either.

Cheers,

That was what I expected, but for whatever reasons, I experienced a
slowdown when setting -x and -y to 1/2 and doubling -c. Did you observe
an improvement in rendering times?

Cheers, Lars.

Hi Lars,

At least in my experiments, the rendering times always improved with increased settings of -c for the same total number of primary rays.  Are you using the new rcontrib implementation or the older rtcontrib (based on rtrace)?  If you are using the latter, then I'm not sure it will always help to increase -c.

The latest HEAD builds only rcontrib and puts a soft link back to rtcontrib in the binary destination directory.

Cheers,
-Greg

A question hard to answer right now - I have to check tomorrow when I am
back on my terminal :) But as I pulled the head-release just some days
ago, this may be the reason why. What I observed was a really
significant slow-down on a very detailed scene. I used very low settings
for -ad in this test (-ad 16) and few ambient bounces (-ab 3).

Cheers, Lars.

I've been planning to make the switch to the new site after bringing the
rest of the workshop content over to the new site.  But really we can make
the switch whenever we want, so if it'll help to get others involved, I'd
think we can make the switch this week.

Subject: [Radiance-general] parameters for dds (rtcontrib) using BSDF

Hi Nassif,
It would be helpful to have more information about your scene and BSDF (and
what is dds.bash??)

I can think of two possible causes of your error:

1 - One of the problems with the Window BSDF data is that they have low
resolution.  The averaging of flux over a BSDF patch causes the direct
sunlight to smear.  The resulting sun patch is bigger and less bright.
 This is illustrated in figures 12 & 13 of this paper:
http://gaia.lbl.gov/btech/papers/4414.pdf

2 - Using the BSDF material in a daylight coefficient simulation can under
estimate illuminance from direct sun.  If your BSDF is for clear glass,
then it should be possible to improve it by setting ss to > 1 (like maybe 8
or 10).  I think this works with rtcontrib...

You might also consider generating a high resolution tensor tree BSDF using
genBSDF.  It'll definitely help with problem 1, and would help with problem
2 if your BSDF is clear glass.

Regardless though, I'd suggest 3-phase method for anual simulations using
BSDFs.  It is much better for non-specular glazing.

Andy

Dear Zack,
   Thank you for posting a link to SPOT version 4 with its source 
files.  I was able to download and read them.
   I look forward to seeing its new home!

- Dan
