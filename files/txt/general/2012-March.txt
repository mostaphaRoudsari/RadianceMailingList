Hi Stefano,

I did not use a graphical user interface, but embedded my scripts'
output into the scene files.

I guess you are aware that Radiance will expand any line starting with
"!command" by the output of the programm "command".

So e.g. having a line "!genSkylight.pl $SIMTIME" you would have
"genSkylight.pl" called when you pass the scene into oconv. Assuming
$SIMTIME is set to the date and time that you want to simulate, your
script could generate the geometry for the skylight and write it to
stdout. If you also have a line "!gensky $SIMTIME" (plus the other
gensky options) somewhere in your scene, you would make sure that the
sky model matches the skylight's configuration. In the end, you would
simply export the environment variable $SIMTIME and call rad scene.rif
to run the simulation. This could e.g. happen in a loop to go through a
full day.

Of course there is a bunch of specialized programs out there, some with
a nice GUI, using Radiance as a back-end. I still wanted to draw your
attention to the fact that it is very easy to add this kind of "dynamic
objects" to your scene using command expansion.

I do not know about Daysim+Python, maybe others on the list can comment.

Cheers, Lars.

The camera ball designed by Jonas Prefli can take 360 degree panoramic
photo.

I wander how this device can be utilized in daylight research if it can
take HDR photos.

Cross-posting to HDRI mailing list.  Please sign up and respond there.

Love the ball camera concept, but unless you integrate some HDR sensors, I don't see how you would do it.  Even if you could program it to take multiple shots, it would be a challenge to align and stitch them.  You would likely have to do the stitching first and alignment later, and motion blur might be a problem as well as parallax, depending on the time between shots taken near the apex of its flight.

Exciting...

The concept of throwing a camera (or 32 of them) into the air for taking
pictures makes it hard to shoot a series of images from the same
location - for later assembly into a HDR image. The device is using
small CCD cameras ("mobile phone cameras"). So the whole setup is
optimized for speed (capturing panoramic scenes with moving objects,
thus one-shot panoramas), not dynamic range.

One might translate the idea into something similar, allowing to shoot a
full panorama HDR image by combining cameras mounted e.g. on a tripod.
These either would need a very high dynamic range - or again shoot a
sequence at varying exposure times. Typically not that much of a problem
in daylighting (clouds are _usually_ not moving that fast). Question is
whether 32 mini-cameras are that much better in doing so then 3 proper
compact cameras with fisheye lenses, covering the same field (sphere) of
view.

Maybe to be discussed on the HDRI list? Cheers, Lars.

Message-ID: <773BB28F-61FE-492E-B7CE-8D30144BA192@lbl.gov>

Hi Everyone,

We're slowly working on a new Radiance website.  The website will replace the existing radiance-online.org and will absorb radsite.lbl.gov.  

The beta version of the new site is http://radiance-online.lbl.gov:82/  (this is a non-standard port, so it may be blocked by your company's firewall - if so try accessing it from home).

LBNL has no funding for this activity, it is officially a community generated site.  We've worked on our own time to get a decent framework.  To speed things up I ask for your help to add content and develop the site further.  The site uses Plone, users can register themselves.  If you are interested in adding content let me know and I will promote you to contributor.

Also, I appreciate recommendations for platforms that allow sharing files (ie models, scripts etc.) with comments and ratings.  I'm not satisfied with Plone's capability in this area. 

Thanks,
Andy

Hi Andy, hi list!


This is a nice framework for an appealing site! I especially like the
fact that the design of the "good old" site could be adopted.

I started setting up something related recently. Not based on Plone but
Drupal, not a complete "Radiance Website" but a concept focussing on
just having a working FAQ one day. You may get an idea here:

http://radiance.larsgrobe.de

The only part of interest on the site is the FAQ for now. I have spent
some time on thinking how to organize a FAQ, and abandoned the idea of
having single categories per question. I believe a tag-system being much
more appropriate, e.g. a question/answer pair on mkillum might be
related to "commands", "diffuse indirect calculation", "complex glazing"
and "optimizations". One day one might decide to also tag the content on
user levels, so a tag "advanced user" might be added. Browsing the
mailing lists, there is such a vast amount of information that I tend to
pay a lot of attention on the topic of marking it. Once a certain amount
of content is available, tag clouds (which may occur in alphabetical
order - I do not rely like the fancy cloud displays typically rendered
with lots of formatting) may be of more help then a fixed hierarchy.

One feature that I spent some time on was to integrate tex notation into
the content management. I added a test on the start page. You can embed
any Latex code in the content, which will be rendered into inline
images, but also be available as pdf downloads. The need to display
formulas and algorithms seams to be of importance. I am going to add
support for describing geometry in the content management, too -
basically I want to keep content descriptive and avoid bitmap images as
far as possible, so that content can be reused (e.g. for copying the
Latex source into a formula editor when writing an article), reformatted
and extended at any time.



On sharing: I think that sharing models is an interesting part of a
community website, though I am not sure that much model content will
become available. Most Radiance models are case-studies - buildings,
rooms, facades. Objects to be shared are more like furniture and other
decorative stuff, not bound to a specific use case - which is already
available on the internat. Similar is true for textures.



I see a need for sharing of cal-files. This would require an interface
where I could check the parameters and get a preview of the results -
downloading the cal-file is easy, using it makes things difficult.


The gallery is a must....


A Radiance material library would be great and is a topic on its own. I
started a concept of holding material data in a database, with several
interfaces to access it. I would prefer the data to be independent of
the software using it, so e.g. I would want spectral resolutions
supported beyond the three RGB channels natively supported by Radiance.

Extracting a Radiance material from this could be implemented in the
interface - combining the measured data from the database with the
assumptions to be made when using it in Radiance (e.g. I would need to
know that the data from the spectrometer are to be used with a plastic
modifier). So a material record could contain a table "models", where I
could add proposed models for various software tools. So querying the
model-table for "Radiance" for this material would return "plastic",
while querying for "MyOtherRenderer" could return "lambertianReflection".



I decided not to publicly announce this project so far, as there is
little content right now. Maybe there is some potential for combining
efforts, so I add this to the discussion.

Cheers, Lars.

Wow Lars, this looks awesome. This is exciting to see that you have put so
much thought into this, and that Andy's getting an effort at LBNL to buff
up the Radiance web offerings there. This topic has come up before, and as
I recall it was discussed at length at the 2003 workshop. It always seems
to die off. I'm not sure how much time I could devote to this effort, but
I'm happy to contribute what I can.

HI Lars,

I think your comments regarding FAQ's are spot on.  I don't want to duplicate effort, so I'd like to let you continue to develop your FAQ and will replace the stub on with a redirection to your site.  It would be nice to integrate the two, at least using the same login/passwords.

I agree that models are generally less useful than objects, but I would contend that in the research community there are desires to share and use standard models.  I have some Radiance models for DOE prototype buildings that others might like to use.  And HMG has 61 models of existing buildings that many have already asked for them to share.

But regardless, we can let users decide which is worth sharing.  And taking the lead from your FAQ, we could get rid of the formal categories and instead using tags.  If you want to simulate a daylight redirecting system you would probably want to see results for both a cal file and a model of the system.

I'll end by saying -  please help!

Andy

I'd also like to point out that NREL is developing the Building Component
Library (BCL), initially conceived as a repository for vetted energy model
components, but there is no reason why Radiance data/models couldn't be
added to the schema. The idea is there will be a place to go to search for
energy model bits -- everything from HVAC, windows, materials, lights,
weather files -- and these can be downloaded, or pulled directly into an
OpenStudio model. I definitely envision us adding Radiance-ready data to
these database members.

We've got it mocked up here: https://bcl.nrel.gov/

So, another place to link to.

Hi All - 

I'm working on a project in which the brightness of the disk of the sun has become a discussion topic. 

Using gendaylit set for California's central valley, a view toward clear (smoggy-ish) sunny skies  at 8am on September 1 reveals a disk luminance of 987,365,074 cd/m2. 

This seems perfectly reasonable, although when I find myself commenting "oh yes, it's about a billion..." I can't help but pause. 

Does anyone know of a handy reference for disk luminance based on location and climate? Or better yet, anyone out there with greater math skills than I know how to derive disk luminance from direct normal radiation found in a weather file? 

Thanks! 

Mike

Hi Andy,

I agree that there is a demand for sharing models. Besides what you mentioned, it is great for educational purpose and for validation. It may even reduce the downloads - if we could remove example scenes from the auxiliary files (errr are they still in there?) and have a makefile not only running oconv and rpict, but fetch model data when needed from a known URL.

For integrating my FAQ-start, I'd be happy to support this. Maybe the formatting would need to be sent through your CSS. Sharing accounts should be rather easy, there are lots of interfaces available in times of social networks (opened? Huuuuh big brother Radiance ;)...). I think we can discuss this off-list (with everyone included who is interested).

For those starting to play around now - please forgive the user-unfriendliness (you may also call it rudeness) of the site in its current stage. I did not plan to make it public yet and posted the address more as a contribution to the discussion. I will do some polishing in the coming days, until then expect it to behave as what it is - still experimental ;)

Cheers, Lars.

Absolutely!  Let me know when it contains Radiance components and I will link to it.  Or better yet, register, I'll promote you, and you can add the link when it is time.

Hi Mike,

See page (number) 60 in chapter 3 here for a description how to derive the luminance of the sun from direct normal illuminance:

http://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm/doku.php?id=resources:thesis

Includes a little discussion re: the inconsistency of applying a measurement taken with an acceptance angle of, say, 6 degrees to a source - the sun - that has an angle 0.5 degrees.  Note that the discussion is couched in terms of predicting illuminance.

Yes those example models are still in there, and we rely on them being
there for testing our builds, so I'd hate to see those ones get moved...

Hi Mike, I think John's equation may be an equivalent equation - but here
is how I have gone about it using these two equations:

E = L * w * cos(theta)

where w is the solid angle of the sun and theta is the incidence angle on
the illuminance plane; 0 for direct normal illuminance.

Then the solid angle can be determined using this:

w = 2 * pi * (1 - cos (half angle) )

This uses the half angle of the solar disc cone, so roughly .25 degrees.

Cheers,
Zack

Hi Andy, Rob, Lars

I'd like to endorse the concept of an FAQ for Radiance, but ask for a slightly broader view of the material definitions. They might initially be listed in the Radiance FAQ listing, but preferably they would also be listed in a more general materials database. There is an increasingly intense need for this: http://www.ibpsa.org/proceedings/BS2005/BS05_0373_380.pdf 

We regularly export from SketchUp today to Daysim/Radiance - EnergyPlus and CATT Acoustic. I would love to be able to be sure that what we do with an 'acoustic tile' and its manufacturer's data for our acoustic analysis carries reliable light properties to the Lighting simulation - and that it can be tracked back to its source: http://www.ibpsa.org/proceedings/BS2009/BS09_1405_1412.pdf Our role as users could well be to rank / rate via social media style techniques the reliability of the data.

If we get these basic steps right then http://www.ibpsa.org/proceedings/BS2001/BS01_0731_738.pdf we have the basis for quality assurance - believable - simulations in an increasingly integrated (BIM or not) world...

M

PS: XML formatting is an example of how the approach could be implemented. XML /IFC or other formatting is not the issue; associated annotation and internet services based serving of data and associated rating of quality level of the data is.

Hi All - 

I'm working on a project in which the brightness of the disk of the sun has become a discussion topic. 

Using gendaylit set for California's central valley, a view toward clear (smoggy-ish) sunny skies  at 8am on September 1 reveals a disk luminance of 987,365,074 cd/m2. 

This seems perfectly reasonable, although when I find myself commenting "oh yes, it's about a billion..." I can't help but pause. 

Does anyone know of a handy reference for disk luminance based on location and climate? Or better yet, anyone out there with greater math skills than I know how to derive disk luminance from direct normal radiation found in a weather file? 

Thanks! 

Mike

Hi Andy,

I agree that there is a demand for sharing models. Besides what you mentioned, it is great for educational purpose and for validation. It may even reduce the downloads - if we could remove example scenes from the auxiliary files (errr are they still in there?) and have a makefile not only running oconv and rpict, but fetch model data when needed from a known URL.

For integrating my FAQ-start, I'd be happy to support this. Maybe the formatting would need to be sent through your CSS. Sharing accounts should be rather easy, there are lots of interfaces available in times of social networks (opened? Huuuuh big brother Radiance ;)...). I think we can discuss this off-list (with everyone included who is interested).

For those starting to play around now - please forgive the user-unfriendliness (you may also call it rudeness) of the site in its current stage. I did not plan to make it public yet and posted the address more as a contribution to the discussion. I will do some polishing in the coming days, until then expect it to behave as what it is - still experimental ;)

Cheers, Lars.

Absolutely!  Let me know when it contains Radiance components and I will link to it.  Or better yet, register, I'll promote you, and you can add the link when it is time.

Hi Mike,

See page (number) 60 in chapter 3 here for a description how to derive the luminance of the sun from direct normal illuminance:

http://www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~jm/doku.php?id=resources:thesis

Includes a little discussion re: the inconsistency of applying a measurement taken with an acceptance angle of, say, 6 degrees to a source - the sun - that has an angle 0.5 degrees.  Note that the discussion is couched in terms of predicting illuminance.

Yes those example models are still in there, and we rely on them being there for testing our builds, so I'd hate to see those ones get moved...

Hi Michael,

I would argue that the NREL Building Component Library seeks to fill this need for a vetted, trackable database of energy model components, where one can track QC, provenance, ratings, etc. The BCL will store weather data, materials data, schedules, systems descriptions, and more. In much the same way that the OpenStudio model is being extended to support not only energy modeling but also daylight modeling, so too will these components contain the data required for whatever the destination simulation tool is. In the case of a luminaire, we plan to store photometric distribution, along with specs and basic energy use that EnergyPlus cares about. Likewise for windows, we plan to store window constructions for EnergyPlus but also a set of BSDFs that can be used by Radiance in a 3-phase daylight coefficient simulation. Like many projects around here, EnergyPlus is the initial focus of support, and Radiance support will be added as we have time and funding. But I would encourage you to check out what is there to get a sense of what the plan is, and I would love to hear feedback from the community as to what else is needed to make this useful to us all. 

I have pinged my co-workers to see if there is any more background on the BCL that I can share, because they know the project much better than I do at this point, but I do think it may fill one of the gaps that we have been discussing today. 

- Rob

It may even reduce the downloads - if we could remove example scenes from the auxiliary files (errr are they still in there?) and have a makefile not only running oconv and rpict, but fetch model data when needed from a known URL.

Sharing accounts should be rather easy, there are lots of interfaces available in times of social networks (opened? Huuuuh big brother Radiance ;)...). I think we can discuss this off-list (with everyone included who is interested).

Hi Michael,

I would argue that the NREL Building Component Library seeks to fill this need for a vetted, trackable database of energy model components, where one can track QC, provenance, ratings, etc. The BCL will store weather data, materials data, schedules, systems descriptions, and more. In much the same way that the OpenStudio model is being extended to support not only energy modeling but also daylight modeling, so too will these components contain the data required for whatever the destination simulation tool is. In the case of a luminaire, we plan to store photometric distribution, along with specs and basic energy use that EnergyPlus cares about. Likewise for windows, we plan to store window constructions for EnergyPlus but also a set of BSDFs that can be used by Radiance in a 3-phase daylight coefficient simulation. Like many projects around here, EnergyPlus is the initial focus of support, and Radiance support will be added as we have time and funding. But I would encourage you to check out what is there to get a sense of what the plan is, and I would love to hear feedback from the community as to what else is needed to make this useful to us all.

I have pinged my co-workers to see if there is any more background on the BCL that I can share, because they know the project much better than I do at this point, but I do think it may fill one of the gaps that we have been discussing today.

- Rob

Hello Radiance community.

I'd like to mention this page

    http://radiance-online.lbl.gov:82/community/plone-tips/plone-notes

for anyone who is interested in contributing to the new radiance-online.org site.  If you have any technical issues related to posting content please direct them to me - Daniel Fuller defuller at lbl.gov.

Plones distinct advantage - apart from its fine-grained community permissions approach, is the the fact that it recognizes normal text files and simple html pages - which means output from utilities like man2html etc can directly be imported and exported unaltered as long as the html is purely structural (no css pop-ups divs etc).  Also large media files like ISO can go directly into the system. For example, if mounted via webdav (see the link above) and entire folder hierarchy of html pages with associated files and images can drag and dropped directly into the cms.

The html files take the most time to upload since they are computed into the zodb - plone's database - but the best thing is that is does not alter the formatting of the original files and the can be retrieved via the webdav mount in the same drag and drop manner the way the went in.  Other non text / html files are forwarded directly on the the webservers filesystem.

Edits in my opinion are best done using the "external editor" feature which can be clunky to setup (requires firefox - safari is prohibitive and I have not tried it with chrome) but once done updating the information can get quite compulsive since its so easy (we want it to be easy to encourage all you content providers to keep your pages fresh).  Getting up to speed using LibreOffice can be a little tricky (ie same page links / anchors are called bookmarks) but I think those of you who have not used it before will find it consistent with its own behavior - anyone with ms word experience will know what that means ;-)

In any case one can start off by copying and pasting the template.html page from the Plone-Tips "Contents" (directory) view (must be logged in)

    https://radiance-online.lbl.gov:447/community/plone-tips/folder_contents

to the directory view of where your new page is going to go - for example in your home folder 

   https://radiance-online.lbl.gov:447/Members/<your login name here>/folder_contents

Then rename the page and use the "Edit with external" application function or just the edit tab to update the page.

I know this sounds long winded - but in the long run it becomes quite automatic.

In in any case you can also start off by creating an html page and dragging and dropping to the plone site via webdav - again see the http://radiance-online.lbl.gov:82/archived/development/plone-notes page.

Thanks all for your patience with this new site and enjoy - if possible ;-)

Subject: [Radiance-general] 11th Radiance Workshop Announcement
Message-ID: <OFB1EC9B3E.7497E763-ONC12579BC.0037BE25-C12579BC.003AF356@DMZ01.WEB>

Dear All, 

We are happy to officially announce the 11th International Radiance 
Workshop to be held at The Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, School of 
Architecture, on 12 to 14 September 2012. The School of Architecture is 
located in the centre of Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark. 

The International Radiance Workshops are annual gatherings of developers 
and users of the Radiance Lighting System. The workshop consists of a 
series of presentations that in the past included case studies on the use 
of Radiance in lighting and/or daylighting projects, recent advanced in 
glare detection, visual comfort and energy savings from lighting controls 
as well as the use of Radiance in Art and Design. At least one session is 
typically also dedicated to technical advances that have been made within 
the Radiance engine over the past year. Presentations from previous 
workshops can be downloaded from http://www.radiance-online.org/.

This year's programme will include one seminar day focusing on Radiance 
tutorials, and two workshop days where people can share and present their 
work. In addition, the programme will also include an official workshop 
dinner and plenty of opportunities for networking with your Radiance 
colleagues. 

More information regarding registration and call for presentations will be 
made available soon on a dedicated web page. 

We look forward to welcoming you in Copenhagen,

Nicolas Roy and Greg Ward

Dear Jan,

I tried as well to run evalglare on Mac OS 10.6.8 and had the same problem posted by Robert.
Was there any development about this?

Thanks, Stefano

Subject: [Radiance-general] Gendaylit overcast sky underestimation issue
Message-ID: <CA+c+v__LW7z=WvQsG-yRAT1CtJr28=6PggDiwTpDRR0sQf-5Uw@mail.gmail.com>

As part of a project I am comparing measured data from both Berkeley and
the Isle de la Reunion to simulated illuminances under the Perez sky model
in both Radiance and 3ds Max Design, however Gendaylit seems to be
producing incorrect sky descriptions for the overcast days in the dataset.
I am wondering if I am missing something critical.

Below is the command I am using to produce a sky description, for 10:30am
on a particularly overcast winter day in Berkeley, with the measured direct
radiation being 0.15W/m^2 and the measured diffuse being 155.13 W/m^2:

gendaylit 12 4 10.5 -W 0.15 155.13 -g 0.2 -a 37.88 -o -122.25 -m -120 >
new.sky

This produces a sky that when simulated (using rtrace, with the -I option,
and multiplying by 179) only gives a global horizontal illuminance of
~12lux, rather than the expected ~19,000lux.

Using the -O option with a value of 2 produces a significantly brighter sky
providing ~800 lux, still far from what I am expecting.

Hopefully someone can spot the problem straight away;

Cheers,

Jake Osborne

Hi Jack,

you missed obviously something important - either you missed to generate 
the sky (then you have just the sun influence) or you made a mistake in 
using rtrace.
It has nothing to do with gendaylit.

you need a sky description like this:

skyfunc glow sky_glow
0
0
4 1 1 1 0

sky_glow source sky
0
0
4 0 0 1 180

skyfunc glow ground_glow
0
0
4 1 1 1 0

ground_glow source ground
0
0
4 0 0 -1 180

putting that into an octree:

oconv -f new.sky outside.rad >test.oct

and then call rtrace using the -I and -ab 1 option:

echo 0 0 0 0 0 1 |rtrace -h -I -ab 1  test.oct | rcalc -e 
'$1=47.4*$1+120*$2+11.6*$3'

Then you get: 17572.5875 lux.

Best,
Jan

Hi, thanks Jan,

That was it. Not sure how I missed it; perhaps thinking too hard and missed
the obvious.

Subject: [Radiance-general] obj2rad splitting planar surfaces?
Message-ID: <jkfq67$rjv$1@dough.gmane.org>

Am I missing something?  It looks like obj2rad is splitting a planar 
rectangle into two triangles.

I think this OBJ file describes a single vertical rectangle:
-----------------------
# Rhino

g IllumSrc__Center
o FirstIllum
usemtl Default
v 81.44685363769531 1 42

vn 0 1 0
vn 0 1 0
vn 0 1 0
f 4/4/4 2/2/2 1/1/1 3/3/3
-----------------------

And this obj2rad file describes two triangles:
-----------------------
# obj2rad one_plane.obj
# Rhino

9
      35.446849823                  1                 90

     81.4468536377                  1                 42

      35.446849823                  1                 42
      35.446849823                  1                 90

# Done processing file: one_plane.obj
# 19 lines, 18 statements, 1 unrecognized
-----------------------


Meantime, I'd better come up with a script that produces the proper output.

Hi Randolph,

Seems obj2rad has an initial test to determine if a polygon has specified normals.  If it does, then it breaks it into triangles.  Once it looks at the triangles, it then sees if the normals actually require interpolation or not.  If they don't, then it doesn't specify a texture, but they still get output as triangles.

Is it a problem?  Just take off the normals if it is.

Best,
-Greg

Thank you very much.  It does matter--these surfaces are going to be 
used by mkillum.  Using -f fixes the problem, and here I am embarassed 
that I didn't figure it out in the first place.

Oh, well.  At least I learned a bit more about debugging Radiance.

No one has figured out how to coordinate processes on Windows yet, so the -n option is not supported there.

Sorry.

Thank you, Greg.
I will try it on MacOS.

Dear group,

I'd like to be able to generate two separate images from an HDR image  
of the sky vault: one with blue sky; the other with clouds and sun  
(assuming it's not occluded).  I'm not well versed in the usage of  
'pcomb' but I'm assuming I'll need to somehow create a mask based on  
both color and brightness thresholds.  It seems from my archive search  
that a call to 'pgblur' with a high radius might help in defining  
sharper boundaries between clouds and blue sky. (http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2008-May/005046.html 
)

Has anyone been successful in achieving something similar?

As always, thanks!

Chris

Message-ID: <FFF56A6D37A3A54F91A03601AC22DA32233EE1A8F7@MAILBOX2.nrel.gov>

Dear Colleagues,

I am pleased to announce that OpenStudio version 0.7.0 is now available, which includes a fair bit of functionality that might be of interest to some of you. While still rough around the edges, users can now build a model in the OpenStudio SketchUp plugin and then use some Ruby scripts to create a Radiance-ready model and use Radiance to perform annual climate-based daylight modeling (CBDM) with the three-phase method (or single phase, or "Radiance classic"). Documentation is in the works, but for those existing OpenStudio users, the main release note is this:

Added "3-phase" option to DaylightSim.rb to allow for facade-independent dynamic window simulations with Radiance and the daylight coefficient method. Users must now specify the "--x" (for single phase method) or "--z" (three phase method) options when running DaylightSim.rb. ModelToRad.rb now also creates a "bsdf" directory as part of the radiance output. In this directory is a "mapping.rad" file which contains a single entry for each unique window group found in the .osm. Each line is a comma-separated list of each window group's necessary 3-phase input files. The first value is the daylight matrix, computed when the user pre-computes the matrices (with the "--dc" option), followed by the BSDF filename for the shades-up window configuration, followed by the BSDF filename for the shades-down window configuration, and finally the view matrix. Users must replace the two bsdf filenames with their own valid BSDFs for their windows, and place the BSDF files (Radiance .xml format) in the "bsdf" directory. When performing an annual simulation, DaylightSim.rb will test for direct sun on each window group, and will deploy shades whenever the solar azimuth is within 90 degrees (plus or minus) to the window group's surface normal. (Support for image generation and stochastic blind operation models is planned.) Three phase is only supported for illuminance maps, no images. Windows support of the new features is untested. Validation efforts are ongoing, and have been interesting, use caution!

There is a Ruby script called "MakeSchedules.rb" that will take an annual daylight illuminance file, a setpoint, and an OpenStudio model and work out a new lighting schedule based on daylight availability, lighting setpoint, and occupancy schedule, ultimately producing an .osm file with an embedded lighting response schedule based on Radiance-computed values. This can be run in the OpenStudio App, to perform an EnergyPlus simulation to get total annual energy savings from daylighting. I'm happy to work with any of you offline or here or on the OpenStudio forums to discuss the use and abuse of the new stuff. 

Check it out at https://openstudio.nrel.gov!

- Rob

P.S. We now have a contract in place with Kitware to wrap up the Radiance binary project. =)

Sounds great, looking forward to trying out the three phase method!

Hi Chris,

Seems no one answered this, but I believe there are experts out there who have played with sky blending techniques.  I won't name any names, you know who you are....

I'm heading out on a little vacation tomorrow with a million things to do first, otherwise I'd take a crack at it.  Maybe you could explain a little more clearly the effect you are going for?

Best,
-Greg

Hi Chris, 

I had something similar a few weeks ago, and figured out this:

pcomb -e 'sens=1.5;difr=(ri(1)-sens)-ri(2);difg=(gi(1)-sens)-gi(2); difb=(bi(1)-sens)-bi(2); ro=if(difr,ri(1),ri(2)); go=if(difg,gi(1),gi(2)); bo=if(difb,bi(1),bi(2)); '  sun.hdr blue_sky.hdr   |   ximage

You can tweak the "sens" variable to get the result you want. In my case (which was not a sky picture) the value was around 0.9 to get the result I was after. The value you need to mask the sun out of the sun.hdr image must probably be higher. If the value is too low, the result will be just a copy of blue_sky.hdr. 

The command first finds the difference between pixel values for red, green and blue in sun.hdr and blue_sky.hdr. The difference (tweaked by 'sens' ) determines from which input file the pixel component value is written to the output.

If you are only interested in changing the luminance values of blue_sky.hdr at those spots where the sun (or clouds) are bright in sun.hdr you may try something like this:

pcomb -e 'sens=1.5;difl=(li(1)-sens)-li(2);ro=if(difl, li(1)*ri(2),li(2)*ri(2) ); go=if(difl, li(1)*gi(2),li(2)*gi(2) ); bo=if(difl, li(1)*bi(2),li(2)*bi(2) );  ' sun.hdr blue_sky.hdr | image

Using these commands, the sun (and clouds) will appear with sharp boundary edges (not blurred) in the resulting composite image. 

Hope this helps a bit, 

Iebele

Hi Chris, 

I made a mistake in last my mail, here the corrected line:

If the value is too high (not too low), the result will be just a copy of blue_sky.hdr.
