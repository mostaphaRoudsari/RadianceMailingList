Dear Radiance Users,

We have reached capacity for talks at the upcoming Radiance workshop in Copenhagen, which includes a seminar day covering DAYSIM, BSDFs, Optimization, and r(t)contrib on Sept. 12th.  The workshop on the 13th and 14th also looks to be very interesting, and we hope you can attend.  However, we are no longer accepting abstract submissions, as there isn't room in the schedule to add anything more.

We're looking forward to seeing you in just over a week.  (Yikes!  I had better start preparing my talks!)

Best,
-Greg (& Nicolas)

P.S.  Forgot to include the workshop web page in case you don't have it handy:

	http://www.radiance-online.org/radiance-workshop11/

The deadline for registration has officially passed, though you can ask Nicolas for special permission if you have extenuating circumstances.  I understand there are about 50 registrants at this point, and we may be reaching venue capacity as well!

Hi Greg (& Nicolas),

Is there a possibility to webcast the workshop similar to what you did last
year?

Wow, this looks like a fantastic program(me)! Some new names as well as old reliables. Excellent. I'm with Mostapha and Chris, if this could be webcast that would be awesome, but failing that I'll settle for the slide decks eventually. Congrats to Nicholas for getting a fully packed schedule! Seems to me that the Radiance community is as active and vibrant as ever.

Hi All,

We have not planned for a podcast, but if there's one of the participant 
who would like to arrange it please let me know - we have an internet 
connection. 

Looking forward to a good workshop!

Best,
Nicolas

Very late question and maybe no time to adjust, but what is the native resolution/ration of the room's projector?

I aam assembling in  4:3  1024x768
But could shift to 16:9  IF you happen to be on-line and that is viable.

Hi Rob,

the same happened to me yesterday. Must be about the mailing list
config, when I choose to reply only to the sender (not to the list) in
my mail client, the mail still gets send out to all. Not sure how to
solve that.

Still, I think your question about the presentation format is of
(almost) general interest for list subscribers, as quite a lot may be in
Copenhagen on Wednesday.

Cheers, Lars.

Thanks to all for hosting this event, attending the event, and for sharing the event with those of us who were unable to attend. Very interesting presentations, and I have not yet seen/heard them all yet! 

Next year at NREL? I guess I'll get started on that now. =)  (that would be awesome.)

All,
I've just uploaded the last of the presentations, including replacing
presentation that had pdf export artifacts.  Greg's photos have also been
posted.  If anyone else has photos they'd like to share, send them to me
and I can add them.

There are now zip files so you can download all the presentations at once.

Message-ID: <F3F955CA-E1A2-47C3-BBB2-25E5C25707D5@gobo.io>


First off: Hello! I am the new guy. My name is Aksel and i am from Berlin, Germany. Thank you all ver much for the rich resources which can be found around here. I have been working with Radiance from time to time during the course of the last 10 years, but unfortunately not further but keeping up to date with principles. 

Now i am digging again, and i seem having problems with the installation on Mac/Mountain Lion. Everything works well at first, i can i.e. compile .octs and render them without problems, which gives me the feeling i didn't mess up the install and paths in general.

But there are some spots which seem to be broken for me, for instance falsecolor aborts telling me helvet.fnt is missing, yet it's there. Or i cannot start off x11meta as in  objline foo.rad | x11meta, gives me an error too. In order to find out which parts have been messed up by me, and which parts are known problems, is there any FAQ with pitfalls for cases like these? I couldn't find one, please excuse me if i missed it.

Thanks a lot,
Aksel

Hi Aksel!

The most important is to check that RAYPATH includes all needed directories. And that these actually contain the libraries you'd expect there. Type

echo "$RAYPATH"

and then find whether at least rayinit.cal is in one of the returned directories.

About x11meta, I am not sure how well it works in general. There seam to be several pitfalls with the meta-utilities.

Hm, and thanks for reminding me that I started setting up a FAQ-system and somehow did not really complete the job so far ;)

Cheers, Lars.

The folder which the echo hands back is existing, and filled with stuff, amongst the rayinit.cal.

Ah, i see. If there are known pitfalls i give the metautilites a break for now. 

I would love to use falsecolor with the helvet.fnt though, any idea on that one?


Thanks a lot,

Hi Aksel, nice to see you on this list! How did you acquire the Radiance
source code? Did you just grab the HEAD? If so, you need to grab the
"auxiliary files" archive from the same place you got the HEAD:

http://www.radiance-online.org/download-install/download-radiance/un-offici
al-head-version/index.html

I'm pretty sure that's where helvet.fnt lives. You can also use the CMake
build system. There was a thread on the dev list recently:

Hi Rob,

Nice to see you too! 

I got the precompiled binaries, worked fine. The thing is, i see the 'helmet.fnt' sitting right here in the lib-folder RAYPATH points to- it's just that falsecolor does not see it the way i do :)

These:
	? rad4R1_macosx_bin.tar.gz
	? rad4R1all.tar.gz

>> 'helmet.fnt' 

Should have been helvet.fnt, that was spelling correction.

I am not here to report a bug or something, i still think the mistake is on my side. I just cannot find out what it is as virtually everything else is working nicely from the first install on.

I am running a Apple MacBook Pro 64 with Mountain Lion on it. Just curious if nobody ever had any issues with the font falsecolor needs?

Aksel

If you search in the archives a bit you should find the same problem
mentioned before. I remember I had to deal with this issues before. From
memory it was either that the file was not included in the distribution
files or it was not copied in the right location by the build script. Can
you tell us where the file is on your system and where your $RAYPATH
variable points to.

Regards,
Thomas

Hi Thomas,

I found the problem with my paths. It was my error, i reentered all paths as stated on the site. Works now like a charm!

The problem though came because i first installed the version from NREL http://openstudio.nrel.gov/getting-started-developer/getting-started-radiance

There it says:
"On MacOS or Linux, add these lines to your .profile or .bashrc ?assuming you are using the bash shell (this is most commonly the default)? files, respectively:

PATH=.:/usr/local/radiance/bin:$PATH
RAYPATH=.:/usr/local/radiance/lib:$RAYPATH
Export PATH RAYPATH"

Those where the paths i entered before, and those didn't do it. Most likely because appending to a non-existing RAYPATH won't do a thing?

Good call, Aksel. I never thought the order mattered, but maybe it does.
At any rate, Andy's instructions are far more detailed than mine on the
OpenStudio site; I'll have to do something about that!


Glad you're up and running, in any case.

Hi Everyone,

I've re-encoded all the audio files from the workshop because some people
had problems listening to them on windows PCs.  The new files play using
iTunes, quicktime or various other *good* media players on windows.  They
still don't play with windows media explorer (unless you've managed to
install the right codec).  I've also updated a few of the presentations
over the last couple of days.

The trouble with posting materials quickly is that revisions become
necessary...

Thanks Andy! I recommend VLC player for all your codec brain damage issues. Seems to play everything (it's what I used to listen to the original files), it's free, and it was suggested to me by none other than John M from this very list.

This is such a good bunch of peeps.

Hi Everyone,

I've re-encoded all the audio files from the workshop because some people had problems listening to them on windows PCs.  The new files play using iTunes, quicktime or various other *good* media players on windows.  They still don't play with windows media explorer (unless you've managed to install the right codec).  I've also updated a few of the presentations over the last couple of days.

The trouble with posting materials quickly is that revisions become necessary...

All,
I've just uploaded the last of the presentations, including replacing presentation that had pdf export artifacts.  Greg's photos have also been posted.  If anyone else has photos they'd like to share, send them to me and I can add them.

There are now zip files so you can download all the presentations at once.

Appending the $RAYPATH to the end should not break anything. If it is
not set, nothing will be appended, that it is.

If you really typed Export as above, with capital E, that may be the
problem.

I am not sure about the syntax. On bash I would not first define the
variables and than export them to the environment, but directly set the
environment variables as

export PATH=.:/usr/local/radiance/bin:$PATH
export RAYPATH=.:/usr/local/radiance/lib:$RAYPATH

But both may be valid.

Cheers, Lars.

Hi Randolph,
		I use an Ocean Optics USB 2000+ spectrometer. It incredibly samples
every 1/3 of a nanometer. I particularly appreciate the SpectraSuite
software needed to drive it. Very useful to determine CCT etc. You can use
MGF tools to convert its text data into a Radiance format. I also
purchased a reference lamp module to keep it calibrated. Used it today in
fact, to sample a 97+ CRI LED.

Here are a few lines from a lamp file..

419.71	1.52070443E-6

Hi,

I have a slightly different CCD spectrometer here. It all depends on what you want to measure. To get emission spectra, applying a calibration function matching wavelengths to pixel numbers may be enough. To get better, one would also have to calibrate the amplitude, as the response is not a flat linear over all pixels. This would not give information on the energy emitted by the source, which would require e.g. an integrating sphere and a quantitative calibration of the device, which is tricky.

Using the device for direct-direct transmission is again possible, direct-hemispherical would require a sphere again. For reflection, a sphere would certainly be required.

It is important to check for over saturated pixels in any measurement! Also the stability of whatever light source is included, together with the integration time of the CCD, are important. See Axel's recent presentation, especially the observations on flicker for different sources?

mgf is perfect to convert from spectral bands to RGB?

Cheers, Lars.

Please do not reply to this or other spurious messages to the mailing list, as it only generates more noise.  I have informed the author and hopefully the situation will be straightened out off-list.

Unfortunately, the mailman list server is not smart enough to filter out unintentional e-mails.

Hi Askel,
You need to adjust the view to do this.  Use -vl an -vs to lift and shift
the view to the upper left and then reduce -vh and -vv accordingly.

Hi Andy,

Thanks! In fact i thought of that for a second, but wasnt aware the shift would work without a distort. I was worried the ie top left and top right part of an image would not fit seamlessly anymore after shifting. But will give it a try now that you recommend it.

You have to carefully determine the -vh and -vv parameters, there's a bit
of trigonometry to be done.  But it does work, I've rendered many image
tiles using this method.

Message-ID: <1B23446CBF250648A2FC775DE3FE7E8017E9FF@OC11expo28.exchange.mit.edu>

Dear colleagues:

Some of might be interested in the Cambridge Solar Map, a new interactive map to show Cambridge property owners how much electricity can be produced on their rooftops from solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, how the financial investment will pay off and how much pollution will be reduced (http://www.cambridgema.gov/solar/). The map is based on Radiance/Daysim simulations of about 17,000 rooftops with the 3D model derived form GIS and LiDAR data. Technical details on the map can be found here<http://mit.edu/SustainableDesignLab/projects/CambridgeSolarMap>.

Those of you in the Greater Boston Area are very welcome to join us on Wednesday, Oct 3,  at 6PM in the Cambridge Main Library on Broadway for the 'official release' of the map. The city has invited a number of solar installers who will be showcasing their products and services. Starting at about 6.30 PM we will have an hour of presentations.

Best,

Christoph
