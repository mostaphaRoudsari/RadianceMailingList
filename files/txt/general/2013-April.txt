PhD Studentship:

Applicability of Climate-Based Daylight Modelling - Research into Practice

Loughborough University - School of Civil and Building Engineering

Applications are invited for a PhD Studentship starting in July 2013 to undertake research in climate-based daylight modelling and its application to solve traditional, novel and emerging problems in the daylighting design of buildings at all scales from individual spaces to urban settings. The work will be supervised by Prof. John Mardaljevic (Loughborough University) and Dr. Francesco Anselmo (Arup, London).

To be of practical use in industry, the disparate strands of CBDM research need to be synthesised to create a robust and authoritative modelling framework - one that has well defined stages, methodologies, quality assurance procedures, etc.  CBDM has been applied to a wide range of real-world projects, e.g., daylighting for museums. But it is still an unknown methodology for most practitioners.

CBDM is constantly evolving, so one of the challenges will be to capture this 'moving target' and give shape and coherence to the future development of CBDM. In addition to working closely with industry, the project is aligned with the aims of two International Commission for Illumination (CIE) Technical Committees on CBDM and Daylighting. Thus the project will have significant impact on the future use and development of CBDM in both research and practice.

The candidate will work in close collaboration with Arup, and be expected to undertake visits/internships at Arup offices in London lasting a minimum of approximately three months over the duration of the project.

Any interested parties should copy emails to Francesco Anselmo and myself.

Folks,

UI-IDL Boise has openings for intern positions. This position is open 
for all, not only for current (grad) students. Both positions 
potentially come with a tuition fee waiver for a graduate program at 
Univ of Idaho.

Informal questions can be directed to myself (eryd at uidaho.edu) or Gunnar 
Gladics (gunnarg at uidaho.edu).

Hello everyone,

Sorry to bring this topic back to live, but I have one doubt.

I thought the view-up was to tell Radiance the orientation of the BSDF
data... I mean, the "y" direction on the BSDF calculations. Is that ok?

In that case, if I put a skylight, my "view up" would be horizontal, even
if the view up of the scene is not....??? Does it make sense to set the
"view up" as 0 0 1 in the case that Jack is mentioning?

THANKS VERY MUCH

German

Hi German,

To orient the coordinates for genklemsamp, the view up vector
is essentially projected onto the plane normal to the view direction (or
BSDF surface normal).  So if you have sloped skylights you can use the +Z
vector for view up, and the BSDF will be oriented so that the +Y direction
is uphill on the skylight.

However if your skylight is horizontal, than +Z is parallel to the view
direction (or BSDF surface normal) so as you suggest you need to provide a
non-vertical view up vector.

Andy

Thanks Andrew, I didn't know about that projection... It may be very useful
in some cases.

I thought I'd let everyone know that I've added the recent annual
simulation tools to the three-phase tutorial.  This includes gendaymtx and
the annual invocation of dctimestep.

If you use the three phase method or daylight coefficient method you should
 check this out.  It saves a considerable ammount of time in the matrix
multiplication step.

Hi Andy,

This is great! Thanks for including the new items.

As a more general question, I had noticed that gendaymtx depends on the 
wea weather file format from Daysim, is there some reason that it does 
not take something more generalized such as epw?

Thanks,

My guess is that Greg was familiar with the Daysim format. Andy did point out to me that Daysim does include an epw to Daysim weather file parser, which should make things easy for folks. We plan to support gendaymtx in OpenStudio as well, which directly supports epw files. Ultimately it would be cool to have gendaymtx support both formats natively, though!

Dear users,

A quick question. How do I rotate the falsocolor image?vwrays_illum_fp2_falsecolor.hdr to match the floor plane??
I need to rotate it around the z-axiz 7.3 dg before it is transformed to the u v coordination system

Below is the input for the working plane image:


void colorpict fc_val_fp2

0
0

fc_val_fp2 glow fc_glow_fp2

12
? ? -112 ?-220 ?40
? ? -169 ?-228 ?40
? ? -167 ?-248 ?40
? ? -110 ?-240 ?40

And here are the transformation fc_fp2.cal file:



nonzero(r,g,b) = if(max(r,max(g,b))-0.1, 1, 0);

fc_u = ((Px+167))/20.1;
fc_v = ((Py+248))/20.1;

Hi Per,

Looks like no one got back to you on this.  Perhaps your question isn't completely clear, because I'm not sure of the answer, either.

Your fc_fp2.cal file seems to be tailored for a particular arrangement of objects.  In general, you can add a transform to your colorpict string arguments to account for simple surface movements.  Did you try:

void colorpict fc_val_fp2
9 red green blue images/vwrays_illum_fp2_falsecolor.hdr fc_fp2.cal fc_u fc_v -rz 7.3
0

If that doesn't do the right thing, you can try "-rz -7.3" instead.  Alternatively, you can eliminate fc_fp2.cal entirely with:

void colorpict fc_val_fp2
15 red green blue images/vwrays_illum_fp2_falsecolor.hdr . Px Py -s 20.1 -t -167 -248 0 -rz 7.3
0
0

Again, I am guessing a bit here as your situation isn't entirely clear to me.

Best,
-Greg

Hi All

For many years in introductory computers in architecture classes I promoted the concept that one should never buy a computer for its own sake. This was when people still debated Apple vs 'IBM-PC' as a purchase option. The mantra I promoted was ASH: Applications - Software - Hardware? So, first figure out an Application that might be better if supported by some form of computational tool; then find the best Software that allowed the greatest enhancement of the Application. Finally this will likely determine which Hardware will be needed at your price point to achieve the enhanced Application. 

I have recently had a MBSc student using Photosphere to process her images from an HDR app for a smart phone. This has led me to the situation where I want to do this myself; so I have bought a Mac? Now, I find anyhere.com is not running (over past 48 hours) Any thoughts as to what is happening?

Hi Mike,

Anyhere runs on a low-budget server that occasionally experiences problem.  In this case, something more serious is going on and I just wrote to the administrator (/ business owner) to find out what.  Hopefully, we'll have it sorted out in a day or two.  Meanwhile, I will e-mail you a copy of Photosphere.

Cheers,
-Greg

P.S.  This probably belongs on the HDRI mailing list, so I'll cross-post my reply there.  Any follow-up should happen on HDRI.

Hi Andy,

I just tried installing this on Ubuntu and got a couple errors.  First it
complained of not having a "BSDFViewer" directory.  Was this supposed to be
in this .tar file?  So, I copied this same directory that was in a
"BSDFViewer1.2_ubuntu" package I got from you and it runs until I get
errors like this for each file in BSDFViewer directory:

/usr/bin/ld: i386 architecture of input file 'xxxxx.o' is incompatible with
i386:x86-64 output

It also complains about not finding a "libBSDF.so" file.

Am I missing some updated files or something else?

Thanks!
Zack

Hi Zack,
Sorry, the BSDFViewer folder should have been in the tar file.  Using an
old one won't work.

here's a link to a new tar file which includes the missing directory:
http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16523492/BSDFViewer1.3a_ubuntu.tar

Andy

PS - Still working on answering all the questions in your previous email...

Dear Andrew,

I missed the first versions and the links are no longer available. I
downloaded the last version you provided ( 1.3a_ubuntu.zip) and it seems
some source files from the common radiance source folder are missing for
succesfull compilation :
cone.c    cone.h    face.c    face.h    free_os.c  image.c  instance.c
instance.h  loadvars.c    mesh.c    mesh.h    modobject.c  otypes.c
otypes.h  readmesh.c  readobj.c    readoct.c  sceneio.c  tmapluv.c
tmaptiff.c  tmaptiff.h
(i copied them from the radiance-HEAD source available on
radiance-online.org)

Then there is a java issue
/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle/include/jni.h:45:20: fatal error: jni_md.h: No
such file or directory
this error comes from the fact that the file is located in the
include/linux rep. (
http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/hadoop-hdfs-dev/201205.mbox/%3C117050669.38033.1336464885155.JavaMail.tomcat at hel.zones.apache.org%3E
)

And now it works!!

Thanks! You just provided me with a great tool that will be quite usefull.
It would be even more if i can directly load a bsdf.xml file from the
comand line (or by an other way). Ist that possible??

I see this ubuntu version includes tensor trees. That is great! I have been
reading a bit about tensor trees and would like to use them to create bsdf
from the simulation of complex fenestration systems. I looked at the code
in the genbsdf routine that creates the tensor tree but i am realy not
familiar with perl... then i found the bsdf_t files in the common dir of
radiance. Is there any specific documentation about this, or an example i
could start from to create and store tensor tree bsdfs?? Idealy i would
like to create a C++ object to do that... Any help or advice would be
greatly apriciated.

Kind Regards.

Andre

Message-ID: <1365768007.13405.YahooMailNeo@web171305.mail.ir2.yahoo.com>

Hi,

A quick. Is it possible to leave out the legend in a falsecolor image and if so how is this done?
Here is my falsecolor call:

falsecolor -i images/Image_DF.hdr -s 10 -n 10 > images/Image_DF_falsecolor_DF.hdr



Best regards

Per

Dear Per,

I understand that choosing 0 as the value for the -lw or -lh options will
eliminate the legend.

Hope it helps! Bye

Hi Andre,
Thanks for sending a report.  I'm gald you were able to get it to work.  It
shouldn't need those other things to build libBSDF.so, so I'll see if I can
remove the dependencies.

What did you do to fix the jni_md.h location problem?  Did you copy it into
the correct place?

The WINDOW team want's to use this software (or a cleaned up versin of it)
to display BSDFs from WINDOW, so it will have the ability to load a file
passed as a command line argument eventually.

The best public documentation is available here (starting at slide 18):
http://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2011-berkeley-ca/presentations/day1/GW3_Multires_BSDF.pdf
but that's not much to go on.

I can also offer a few images of the tensor tree angle bsdf basis to help
understand how the shirly-chiu mapping works with the hilbert curve:

Here's a new zip file with all the common src files:
http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16523492/BSDFViewer1.3b_ubuntu.zip

BSDFViewer doesn't need all of them, but it's easier to include it all than
it is to figure out which ones aren't necessary and edit the Rmakefile...

Hi Andy,

thanks for the update and the various info on tensor trees.

I m looking forward for a version with command line loader for the viewer.
keep us posted!

Refarding the jni_md.hlocation, yes i just copied it the the parent folder.
This is probably not the best solution, a link would be better or even
better add the right folder to the include path in the makefile..

Ragards,
Andre

Subject: [Radiance-general] Rendering parameters help and weird colors
Message-ID: <CAF-iH4LQxMrNP0OHtMkE_c2DJtZm2ruN5H4x-EcaYQQqwjrK4g@mail.gmail.com>

Dear List,

So I have been rendering with some interesting features in SketchUp, like
exporting landscapes (hills and mountains) from GoogleEarth.

Here is a link for you to understand what I am talking
about<https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ltv125db6hjp74a/hsnL6S-_JI>

Anyway, I have been rendering some stuff and I have two doubts:

1.- My environment is basically grey, but only the mountain near my
building is brown; but everything has turned to be brown (as can be seen in
Image2)... is that the "color bleeding" (or something like that)? Is that a
good result? or there is a problem with my modeling?

2.- As can be seen in Image (the one that shows the interior of the
building, looking out), there are some weird effects, making my image to
look as it was painted with a brush or something. What is the parameter
that would help me reduce that?

I am not sure why in Dropbox the images look much more darker than in my
PC. They were created using rpict, and then filtered with "pfilt -x /2 -y
/2 image.hdr > image.tiff"

THANKS VERY MUCH

German

Hey German,

For sure it looks like there is some color bleeding, and also the fact that you have modeled the entire mountain ? making your model extents fairly large relative to the area of interest (your building interior) is likely causing you some pain here too. It would be helpful to see your material definitions, and also your rendering parameters (particularly the ambient (-a*) ones).

On the other hand, the reason I modeled the mountain is to actually
consider the shading it provides (that is the area I am working on)... so I
think just eliminate it would not be the solution.

Is color bleeding a problem that "would occur in real life"?? I mean, is a
modeling problem (clearly the mountain is not completely brown), or a weird
effect of the algorithms involved?

THANKS AGAIN!

It does look like there's quite a bit of color bleeding, and the thin stripe of sunlight on the floor makes for difficult sampling as well.  You would be much better off treating your window as an illum in this case using mkillum.  You can follow the tutorial example at the end of chapter 1 if you're not sure how to do this:

Hi German,

I understand, but the problem with modeling far-reaching terrain is that the spacing between your ambient sampling points blows up quite a bit. What I generally recommend is that you substitute the actual mountain with proxy geometry closer to the building (say, within 100' of the building perimeter) that represents the shading effect of the distant ground. In other words, project the mountain onto flat polygons closer to the scene-

...and Greg just chimed in with a better answer. =)

On the other hand, the reason I modeled the mountain is to actually consider the shading it provides (that is the area I am working on)... so I think just eliminate it would not be the solution.

Is color bleeding a problem that "would occur in real life"?? I mean, is a modeling problem (clearly the mountain is not completely brown), or a weird effect of the algorithms involved?

THANKS AGAIN!

Hey German,

For sure it looks like there is some color bleeding, and also the fact that you have modeled the entire mountain - making your model extents fairly large relative to the area of interest (your building interior) is likely causing you some pain here too. It would be helpful to see your material definitions, and also your rendering parameters (particularly the ambient (-a*) ones).

Color bleeding certainly happens in real life, but most mountains are not this orange on average.  You have modeled an unusual condition, and might be better moving it to a more neutral color.  Also, many cameras perform automatic white balance, which Radiance does not do for you.

Because the size of your exterior site geometry is so large compared to your room, you could increase -ar. There's a formula to calculate a good value, which I think is part of what the rad command does if the scene dimensions are set smaller than your whole octree. If your rendering doesn't take too long you could just try increasing it arbitrarily, maybe jump up to 1000 to look for any benefit. You could also try setting -as around 500 instead of the default 128.

Those are the quick and easy things to try, but the recommendations from Rob and Greg might be even better or faster.

My ambient parameters were (the rest are all defaults):

Well, thanks guys! I will try making the -ar bigger, and illum. Is just, I
think that, on the Rendering with Radiance Book, John Mardaljevic mentions
that for daylighting it is not recommended to use Illums.

Anyway... I will use more neutral colors, illums and a higher ambient
resolution as a learning exercise.

*Would this same model cause problems when using the Three-phase method?*

THANKS VERY MUCH

Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance on Raspberry Pi
Message-ID: <CADoMKs0G_pqF27LNQJu0CkK3n5GUobxi10qwK2-D=ydZhu=1Ow@mail.gmail.com>

For those interested, I built Radiance on a Raspberry Pi yesterday
(700 MHz single-core ARMv6, 3.5W, 512 MB RAM) and ran the speed test
from http://markjstock.org/pages/rad_bench.html.

The results are not encouraging, but you don't buy a Raspberry Pi for
speed. It took 17 hours to finish the rpict portion of the test. The
best serial time ever recorded was just under 18 minutes on an Intel
i7-2600K from 1.5 years ago (57x faster). The peak SMP time is 3.5
minutes, recorded earlier this year (296x faster). The Raspberry Pi's
time was similar to what we would expect from computers from 2001-2: a
Pentium II at about 250MHz, or a 400HMz Sun UltraSparc, both which
regularly sported about 512MB of RAM, but obviously cost about 100x
more.

100 Raspberry Pi machines, networked and working in parallel, would
consume 350W and cost $3500 (not counting networking hardware), both
numbers in the ballpark of the best current CPU-intensive
single-workstation systems. Assuming perfect parallelization, it could
finish in a little over 10 minutes, but a more realistic guess would
be 15-20 minutes. I'm glad NREL decided to go with the Xeon Phi
instead of a cluster of RPis.

Maybe I should start a Radiance "speed" test that measures the results
in Joules instead of seconds.

Subject: [Radiance-general] rtrace direction
Message-ID: <CAD7gt0W1Tp89jr9b1E6-AZ6d_jtJwMk82tQ7qSM-WU_XoMVvNg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone!

This is my first email to the group. :)

My queries are:

When the input to rtrace is lets say 0 0 0 0 0 1. (X,Y,Z origin = 0; X,Y,X
direction is from Up or 0 0 1) then:

1. Does it creates ONLY a single Ray from this point (0 0 0) towards
direction (0 0 1), in this case normal towards Zenith? Just to make sure I
am getting the right concepts of ray tracing.

2. If it is so, then output irradiance is from ONLY the Up direction (0 0
1), and not from any other direction?

3. If it is so, then: is it possible (may be a rarest of the rare case) to
get Zero irradiance at a point from a particular direction?

I am asking this because I am getting Zero irradiance at a vertical surface
inside the room when the direction given to rtrace is normal to this
surface. E.g for a point on North wall, the direction given is 0 -1 0. For
all the other interior surfaces I am getting some reasonable irradiance
values, but only for North wall its Zero. So my reasoning for this was,
since rtrace traces only a single ray from a point towards a particular
direction then it is possible (though rarely) to get zero irradiance from
that direction. I just thought to get your opinion on my reasoning.

All surface normals are towards inside of the room.

Thank you in anticipation! Hope I made my question clear.

Hello again!

By doing some parametric analysis I got my answer. Actually my so called
photocell was facing the window, and since I had no sky distribution (only
sun defined in my sky file), thats why in the model there was no sky
environment (just like in outer Space). Hence the recieved irradiance at
that location was Zero. I think I am right now.

Thanks!

Hi Vaibhav,

it is hard to tell what caused the result, as we do not know the
parameters you used with rtrace. For the point to be interpreted as an
irradiance sensor, which seams to be what you expect, you need the -I
switch at least.

Cheers, Lars.

Thanks Lars. Actually my illuminance sensor (I already used -I switch),
was spatially located on a wall, with its direction towards a window Xorg
Yorg Zorg 0 -1 0. But out of this window there was no sky glow or source
defined (neither ground); only Sun source was defined. Thats why, the
sensor was not able to trace any ray coming from that direction (0 -1 0)
using rtrace, because there was no sky. But finally I understood that and
the issue is now resolved. Also this proved to me that there is some
reverse ray tracing going on. :)

This was my command: echo '3 4 1.5 0 -1 0' | rtrace -w -as 512 -ar 512 -aa
0.15 -ab 2 -i+ -h sunnyScene.oct | rcalc -e
'$1=($1*.265+$2*.67+$3*.065)*179'

Thanks again!

Vaib

that in my university assignment. Just see the 'last page' of this report:

Dear List,

 

I have a problem that I hope the radiance community can help me
understand.

 

Assume you have simulated a scene with artificial light and you have set
the colour of the light to true white (R=G=B; approximate colour
temperature 6500k).

I assume it should be possible in postprocessing to alter the colour
temperature of the light source and of the scene (assuming that's the
only light source) using some pcomb expression (different coefficients
for the RGB coordinates). 

Does anybody have any pointer to the math required to calculate the
coefficient to change the light source from, say, 6500K to 3000K?

 

Thanks in advance,

 

Giovanni

In order to correctly interpret the data contained in <ScatteringData>

Hi Aitor,

The number of the patches is from normal to tangent, looping over Thetas
and Azimuths... I think it is easier for you to see it instead of reading
it. You can go to http://www.radiance-online.org/download-install and
download the BSDF viewer, and put Show Patch Numbers.

About the units, I understand they are Incident Irradiance over Outgoing
Radiance, and the number there can be deduced as the percentage of
transmission of that transmitted by an "air" layer. In the case of Klems
(W6 standard) basis, the values for the air layer are, aproximately:

  *Patch Number* *1/cos(?).?*  1 41,9043  2-9 42,8764  10-25 45,6281  26-45
42,333  46-69 44,6724  70-93 44,6724  94-117 50,7996  118-133 45,6281
134-145 57,0215
The experts may have much more information about this.

Good Luck,

German

Hi Aitor,

This question probably belongs on the radiance-dev list, so I am cross-posting there and ask you to sign up (if you haven't already) and respond on that list.  (Same goes for others -- thanks!)

The data order in the file is a matrix running from smallest to largest Klems patches, with the columns (inner loop data) corresponding to the input directions.  This is verified by a tag in the "DataDefinition" section that says:

	<IncidentDataStructure>Columns</IncidentDataStructure>

If "Rows" appears there instead of Columns, then the outgoing directions are the inner loop, but this would be unusual and probably not supported by WINDOW.

The units of a BSDF are 1/steradians.

If you have the opportunity to link to C code, you may also use the existing BSDF parser library included in the Radiance source tree to do the data loading and interpretation.

Best,
-Greg

Hi Aitor,

I recommend considering using the BSDF parser library from Radiance if you
can.  The library has load and query routines to get everything you need.
 It supports both Klems and TensorTree BSDFs without any need to
differentiate between them your side.

I used it for BSDF viewer, and it would have been a breeze if I didn't need
to use Java Native Interface in the process.

Andy

Vaib,

There is an important difference between the -i (lower case i) and -I
(capital i) in rtrace.   When -i is given, rtrace will trace a ray in the
direction given, and then will calculate the hemispherical irradiance at
the point where the ray intersects with geometry (ignoring some material
types).  With the -I command it calculates the hemispherical irradiance at
the point you specify using the direction vector as a a normal for the
imaginary surface on which irradiance is calculated.

Users typically want -I, except for specialized cases.  You should make
sure that  -i is correct for your case.

Andy

Hi Giovanni,

Your question is difficult to answer.  You have not said whether you want to show what a "white balanced" image would look like, in which case you are better off doing nothing.  If you want to show what the image would have looked like had you used your 6500K white balance on a scene with 3000K illumination, then the answer may be computable.  The way I would do it is in the following stages:

1) Convert to a sharpened RGB color space using:

	$ ra_xyze -r -p .6898 .3206 .0736 .9003 .1166 .0374 .3333 .3333 orig.hdr > sharp.hdr

2) Compute the (x,y) chromaticities for your two color spaces using src/cal/cal/blackbody.cal and convert to Sharpened RGB space and get the ratios between RGB at 3000K to RGB at 6500K:

	$ icalc blackbody.cal xyz_rgb.cal
	CIE_pri(i) = CIE_Sharp(i)
	x65=cct_x(6500); y65=cct_y(6500)
	x30=cct_x(3000); y30=cct_y(3000)
	R(x30,y30,1-x30-y30)/R(x65,y65,1-x65-y65)
	$1=1.6033242
	G(x30,y30,1-x30-y30)/G(x65,y65,1-x65-y65)
	$2=1.10306009
	B(x30,y30,1-x30-y30)/B(x65,y65,1-x65-y65)
	$3=0.439966014

3) Apply these RGB ratios to the Sharpened version of the image and convert back to standard RGB:

	pfilt -1 -er 1.6033 -eg 1.1031 -eb 0.4400 sharp.hdr | ra_xyze -r > shift3000.hdr

If your result looks horribly orange, then you know you've succeeded.  That's just what happens when you shoot indoors with a daylight whit balance!

Cheers,

P.S.  You could of course combine steps #1 and #3 if you like really long command lines:

	ra_xyze -r -p .6898 .3206 .0736 .9003 .1166 .0374 .3333 .3333 orig.hdr | pfilt -1 -er 1.6033 -eg 1.1031 -eb 0.4400 | ra_xyze -r > shift3000.hdr

P.P.S.  The reason for converting to a sharpened RGB color space is that this does a better job simulating adaptation in your eye.  You could skip this step and get similar results using the standard RGB color space.

Thanks Greg,

 

Yes, I'm expecting orange results! 

 

The idea is to merge different images (with different light sources)
together. 

Each light source will have a different colour temperature; as our eye
can't adjust simultaneously to all of them, my assumption is (crude, I
admit!) that it will adjust to the main light source/colour temperature,
while the other will look coloured (just as a lightbulb looks orange in
daylight).

 

Thanks for sharing this, I'll get into understanding the code now (and
translating for windows)

 

 

Giovanni

Hi Giovanni,

 

Your question is difficult to answer.  You have not said whether you
want to show what a "white balanced" image would look like, in which
case you are better off doing nothing.  If you want to show what the
image would have looked like had you used your 6500K white balance on a
scene with 3000K illumination, then the answer may be computable.  The
way I would do it is in the following stages:

 

1) Convert to a sharpened RGB color space using:

 

                $ ra_xyze -r -p .6898 .3206 .0736 .9003 .1166 .0374
.3333 .3333 orig.hdr > sharp.hdr

 

2) Compute the (x,y) chromaticities for your two color spaces using
src/cal/cal/blackbody.cal and convert to Sharpened RGB space and get the
ratios between RGB at 3000K to RGB at 6500K:

 

                $ icalc blackbody.cal xyz_rgb.cal

                CIE_pri(i) = CIE_Sharp(i)

                x65=cct_x(6500); y65=cct_y(6500)

                x30=cct_x(3000); y30=cct_y(3000) 

                R(x30,y30,1-x30-y30)/R(x65,y65,1-x65-y65)

                $1=1.6033242

                G(x30,y30,1-x30-y30)/G(x65,y65,1-x65-y65)

                $2=1.10306009

                B(x30,y30,1-x30-y30)/B(x65,y65,1-x65-y65)

                $3=0.439966014

 

3) Apply these RGB ratios to the Sharpened version of the image and
convert back to standard RGB:

 

                pfilt -1 -er 1.6033 -eg 1.1031 -eb 0.4400 sharp.hdr |
ra_xyze -r > shift3000.hdr

 

If your result looks horribly orange, then you know you've succeeded.
That's just what happens when you shoot indoors with a daylight whit
balance!

 

Cheers,

-Greg

 

P.S.  You could of course combine steps #1 and #3 if you like really
long command lines:

 

                ra_xyze -r -p .6898 .3206 .0736 .9003 .1166 .0374 .3333
.3333 orig.hdr | pfilt -1 -er 1.6033 -eg 1.1031 -eb 0.4400 | ra_xyze -r
> shift3000.hdr

 

P.P.S.  The reason for converting to a sharpened RGB color space is that
this does a better job simulating adaptation in your eye.  You could
skip this step and get similar results using the standard RGB color
space.

	Dear List,

	 

	I have a problem that I hope the radiance community can help me
understand.

	 

	Assume you have simulated a scene with artificial light and you
have set the colour of the light to true white (R=G=B; approximate
colour temperature 6500k).

	I assume it should be possible in postprocessing to alter the
colour temperature of the light source and of the scene (assuming that's
the only light source) using some pcomb expression (different
coefficients for the RGB coordinates). 

	Does anybody have any pointer to the math required to calculate
the coefficient to change the light source from, say, 6500K to 3000K?

	 

	Thanks in advance,

	 

	Giovanni

Hi Mark,

This is indeed very interesting. (And very cool, in my opinion!)

I have been looking for a low-cost platform to do HDR image generation (in
the field) with the program HDRGEN, the command-line HDR image builder.

http://www.anyhere.com/

Any idea how long it would take the Pi to composite 7 .JPG images (say
about 1000px by 1000px in dimension) into an HDR image?.

(Then i would do a bit of analysis with Radiance and send some commands to
control physical devices)

Best,

-Kyle

Thank you Andy and Lora for correcting me and pointing this out. Since it
was my first project I was under an impression that + sign after -i makes
it equivalent to -I. Ignorance can be dangerous in simulation.. :)
Wonderful group and spirit. Next semester I have to work much with Radiance
because it will be used in my masters thesis. So I have to start digging
deep and experiment more. Thank you again!

Hi Giovanni!

In this case you may white-balance the combined contributions of the colored sources. pcomb would do that job quite easily. The procedure is similar to the daylight coefficient approach based on rcontrib. You render one image for each light source (using rtrace, rpict or rcontrib) first with normalized radiance for each source (say RGB 100,100,100). Than you use pcomb to "scale" the images according to the desired source output, and finally add the images for each source.

Cheers, Lars.

That's awesome.  Now if only someone would do something like a 
Raspberry Pi with a multicore ARM.

Ummmmm.  You know, Archos 101 G9s are multicore ARM tablets.  They run 
Android, which runs on Linux.  It *could* be done?

It's already happening. Tilera has a 72-core chip, and Parallella is
hoping to sell a 16-core chip for $100.

http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/adapteva/parallella-a-supercomputer-for-everyone

How well these chips will perform Radiance simulations is still
unknown, though some knowledge will definitely be gained when NREL
begins exercising their new Xeon Phi-powered supercomputer.

Hi Lars,

 

Yes, you cantered the point of what I am trying to do. Render different light sources separately potentially change their intensity and colour temperature and compose them together to get a combined result.

The tricky bit is to calculate the right coefficients to change CCT of the light source, which Greg explained with a method of an elegance I wouldn?t have reached on my own!

 

Thanks again!

 

G

Hi Giovanni!

 

In this case you may white-balance the combined contributions of the colored sources. pcomb would do that job quite easily. The procedure is similar to the daylight coefficient approach based on rcontrib. You render one image for each light source (using rtrace, rpict or rcontrib) first with normalized radiance for each source (say RGB 100,100,100). Than you use pcomb to "scale" the images according to the desired source output, and finally add the images for each source.

 

Cheers, Lars.

 

	Thanks Greg,

	 

	Yes, I?m expecting orange results! 

	 

	The idea is to merge different images (with different light sources) together. 

	Each light source will have a different colour temperature; as our eye can?t adjust simultaneously to all of them, my assumption is (crude, I admit!) that it will adjust to the main light source/colour temperature, while the other will look coloured (just as a lightbulb looks orange in daylight).

	 

	Thanks for sharing this, I?ll get into understanding the code now (and translating for windows)

	 

	 

	Giovanni

	Hi Giovanni,

	 

	Your question is difficult to answer.  You have not said whether you want to show what a "white balanced" image would look like, in which case you are better off doing nothing.  If you want to show what the image would have looked like had you used your 6500K white balance on a scene with 3000K illumination, then the answer may be computable.  The way I would do it is in the following stages:

	 

	1) Convert to a sharpened RGB color space using:

	 

	                $ ra_xyze -r -p .6898 .3206 .0736 .9003 .1166 .0374 .3333 .3333 orig.hdr > sharp.hdr

	 

	2) Compute the (x,y) chromaticities for your two color spaces using src/cal/cal/blackbody.cal and convert to Sharpened RGB space and get the ratios between RGB at 3000K to RGB at 6500K:

	 

	                $ icalc blackbody.cal xyz_rgb.cal

	                CIE_pri(i) = CIE_Sharp(i)

	                x65=cct_x(6500); y65=cct_y(6500)

	                x30=cct_x(3000); y30=cct_y(3000) 

	                R(x30,y30,1-x30-y30)/R(x65,y65,1-x65-y65)

	                $1=1.6033242

	                G(x30,y30,1-x30-y30)/G(x65,y65,1-x65-y65)

	                $2=1.10306009

	                B(x30,y30,1-x30-y30)/B(x65,y65,1-x65-y65)

	                $3=0.439966014

	 

	3) Apply these RGB ratios to the Sharpened version of the image and convert back to standard RGB:

	 

	                pfilt -1 -er 1.6033 -eg 1.1031 -eb 0.4400 sharp.hdr | ra_xyze -r > shift3000.hdr

	 

	If your result looks horribly orange, then you know you've succeeded.  That's just what happens when you shoot indoors with a daylight whit balance!

	 

	Cheers,

	-Greg

	 

	P.S.  You could of course combine steps #1 and #3 if you like really long command lines:

	 

	                ra_xyze -r -p .6898 .3206 .0736 .9003 .1166 .0374 .3333 .3333 orig.hdr | pfilt -1 -er 1.6033 -eg 1.1031 -eb 0.4400 | ra_xyze -r > shift3000.hdr

	 

	P.P.S.  The reason for converting to a sharpened RGB color space is that this does a better job simulating adaptation in your eye.  You could skip this step and get similar results using the standard RGB color space.

		Dear List,

		Assume you have simulated a scene with artificial light and you have set the colour of the light to true white (R=G=B; approximate colour temperature 6500k).

		I assume it should be possible in postprocessing to alter the colour temperature of the light source and of the scene (assuming that?s the only light source) using some pcomb expression (different coefficients for the RGB coordinates). 

		Does anybody have any pointer to the math required to calculate the coefficient to change the light source from, say, 6500K to 3000K?

Message-ID: <CACWEaWzbhOBNsOaL6hTZsZj2MS5_1x9v2zhWuDdHfGaop=ne2w@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Radiance users,

This is my first attempt on this forum to find how to integrate a fritted
pattern on an IGU.
As far as I get, I have generated from Optic 5 some data from the product I
was looking for.

I got interested by this post:
http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2002-June/000327.html

but how to integrate the definition of the fritted material (typically 50%
fritted - white color) ? Looking deeper, it seems there is a script "glaze"
that can be used with Radiance but I couldn't find it\used it.

I am trying to follow these guidelines :
http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/research/gsdsquare/Presentations/devalpine_visarc_glazing.pdf

Thanks a lot for your feedback.

Best,

Dear List,

I am a starter on the use of Radiance, and I have some doubts about the
modeling (of the real world, as it always is, in engineering at least). I
have heard that material reflectivity is a very important parameter that.
How important are:

- Color (I am pretty sure I read something in this list about grey-world
simulations... I think it was Rob).
- Textures
- Specularities
- Patterns
etc.

My concern is that defining materials is actually not a very easy task, so
I just wanted to know what are the most important things here.

THANKS VERY MUCH!

Hi,

a very short follow-up on this topic:
R=G=B in Radiance does not have an approximate color temperature of 6500K.
R=G=B corresponds to an equi-energy spectrum over the visible part which
has a correlated color temperature of approx. 5456K.

Best,
David

Hi German,

Yeah, modeling materials can be tricky, particularly if you want accuracy. Life is not always fair, you get what you pay for, and there's also no such thing as a free lunch, either. =)

For me, doing relative studies of architectural scenes, it's always made sense to keep things simple which does mean keeping color out of the equation (both for materials and light sources), and using generally diffuse materials (which is really the majority of architectural materials that cover broad expanses of interior spaces). When specularity is a critical component of a surface, such as in light redirecting materials, I resort to BSDFs or other means of describing the light scattering (photometric distribution file resulting from light forwards ray tracing exercise, usually).

Some amazing things can be done with textures and patterns to enhance the realism of a rendering, but I'm generally more interested in numbers so I have not played with those too much. I can tell you that you are automatically introducing more variables to the physical definition of the surface to which you are applying those textures and patterns, so tread carefully.

Material definition has been discussed at length on this list, so I'd search the archives. Also check out Carsten Bauer's amazing textures and patterns from his Workshop talk in 2002 (linked on the Radiance-online.org website) for inspiration as to what's possible with textures, patterns, and the Radiance functional language -- sick stuff!

haha, I know things are not free.

So, basically using grey diffusing materials with relatively correct
reflectivity would be great for achieving good numbers?

When specularity is a critical component of a surface, such as in light redirecting materials, I resort to BSDFs or other means of describing the light scattering (photometric distribution file resulting from light forwards ray tracing exercise, usually).

Some amazing things can be done with textures and patterns to enhance the realism of a rendering, but I'm generally more interested in numbers so I have not played with those too much. I can tell you that you are automatically introducing more variables to the physical definition of the surface to which you are applying those textures and patterns, so tread carefully.

Material definition has been discussed at length on this list, so I'd search the archives. Also check out Carsten Bauer's amazing textures and patterns from his Workshop talk in 2002 (linked on the Radiance-online.org website) for inspiration as to what's possible with textures, patterns, and the Radiance functional language -- sick stuff!

Dear List,

I am a starter on the use of Radiance, and I have some doubts about the modeling (of the real world, as it always is, in engineering at least). I have heard that material reflectivity is a very important parameter that. How important are:

- Color (I am pretty sure I read something in this list about grey-world simulations... I think it was Rob).
- Textures
- Specularities
- Patterns
etc.

My concern is that defining materials is actually not a very easy task, so I just wanted to know what are the most important things here.

THANKS VERY MUCH!

German

Hi German,

I have cross-posted this reply to the radiance-openstudio list.

To change the reflectance of a material in OpenStudio, you need to change the *absorptance* to the inverse of the reflectance you want. Since OpenStudio's first allegiance is to EnergyPlus, materials are monochromatic and take absorptance rather than reflectance as a parameter. We need to work within the EnergyPlus worldview for now.

Remember, in OpenStudio parlance, surfaces have *constructions* applied to them, which are made up of one or more materials. So the process is first you need to identify what construction is applied to your surface, then look at the makeup of the construction, to find the material that affects your light reflectance (absorptance). Make sense?

In the future we'd like to add direct entering of Radiance material parameters so you can include specularity and roughness (and color), but for now it's diffuse gray. =)

haha, I know things are not free.

So, basically using grey diffusing materials with relatively correct reflectivity would be great for achieving good numbers?
