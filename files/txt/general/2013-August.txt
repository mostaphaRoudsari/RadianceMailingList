Subject: [Radiance-general] epw2wea
Message-ID: <CAN1QwsNCpw5hdtguvj=RYb3Ps_Mi1xMV1ypKBq17BRw0HtSW5w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have a question about the epw2wea program, which converts an Energy Plus
Weather file (EPW) into a WEA format.
When you use epw2wea command, the resulting WEA file usually has 5 columns.
Are they in the following order?


Month  |  Day  |  Hour  |  Global horizontal irradiance  |  Direct normal
irradiance


Best,
Leyla

Hi Leyla,

Actually it's slightly different, according to the gendaymtx man page:

"Gendaymtx  takes a weather tape as input and produces a matrix of sky patch values using the Perez all-weather
       model.  The weather tape is assumed to be in the simple ASCII format understood by DAYSIM,  which  contains  a
       short  header  with  the  site parameters followed by the month, day, standard time, direct normal and diffuse
       horizontal irradiance values, one time step per line."

BTW, we are working on getting a version of epw2wea into the Radiance source tree so that future Radiance installers will include this utility in a regular Radiance install. I kinda thought that with gendaymtx being part of Radiance now, a utility to convert standard EnergyPlus weather files into the Daysim format was pretty much a dependency now, and luckily Christoph Reinhart agrees. NREL has a version of epw2wea that is compiling on all platforms and we hope to get it integrated into the Radiance source soon. 

Also, we are currently testing our integration of gendaymtx into OpenStudio; we are now seeing annual climate based daylight simulation execution times in a matter of minutes (single phase)! We hope to have this capability integrated into the release in time for the Radiance Workshop. Stay tuned...

- Rob

Subject: [Radiance-general] pcond, luminance or visible radiation?
Message-ID: <CAO0Bi3XiEQ7CBF5806AjKfvyD2wB5wfo2cgt0G9xwhZx-7qscg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all, I'd appreciate your help on the following question:

I'm creating a radiance scene using gendaylit to generate the sky, since I
have data of the diffuse horizontal and direct normal irradiance (W/m^2)
I'm using the -W option and then -O 2 to obtain the output in lm/m^2/sr
(luminance). Then I'm using rpict to generate the picture, and pcond -h to
convert it to a human visual response.

But I realized that if I use the default value of -O in gendaylit (output
in radiance of the visible radiation W/m^2/sr) the picture looks less
bright.

So I don't know which one is the right one to use in this case.

I tried to find out if the default input when using pcond would be
luminance rather than visible radiation, but couldn't find an answer for
that, or maybe there is another command other than pcond, that takes the
input in luminance values, then that would be the one I should use.

Or maybe there is an additional step that I'm missing...

I wonder if somebody can give me a hint about this, and/or where to look..
:)

Thanks in advance!!

Can you clarify the exact process when you say the picture looks less bright? The picture out of pcond is just visually less bright? If you're looking at values prior to using pcond, your process to get values out of your image is probably based on the assumption that the scene is set up using defaults (visible W/m^2/sr). If you convert to lumens in your scene description from gendaylit, then you have to be careful that you're not again converting to lumens (with a 179 multiplier) after your calculation.

Hi, and thank you for your reply!!

If I select the output of gendaylit -O 2 (lm/m^2/sr) then I generate the
picture using rpict, convert to human visual response using pcond
-h and then to bmp using ra_bmp then I get a picture that is visually more
brighter than if I select the output of gendaylit -O 0 (default) and then
multiply by 179.

I confirm, when I use -O 2 (output lm/m^2/sr) then I don't multiply by 179,
only when I select the default output (W/m^2/sr).

I don't have problem with the results of the values, but with the generated
picture, using the default of the parameter -O the picture looks less
brighter
(even after *179).

I wonder which of the two pictures is the right one, as it doesn't seem to
have anything to do with the results of the values, but with the way how
the image
is created...I guess...


I really apprecieate your help!

:)

Subject: [Radiance-general] Use of Lighting information on EPW file
Message-ID: <E3C4184F-A2CB-4BF2-ABB0-A26091AFBA63@gmail.com>

Dear List, I am not sure this is directly applied to Radiance, but for lighting it definitively is. 

I was checking out some stuff, and started wondering why are we not using the Lighting information? I am reading THIS, and it says "Illuminance (Global Horizontal, Direct Normal, Diffuse Horizontal, Zenith Luminance).

My question is: Is there any reason for not using the Direct Normal and the Diffuse Horizontal information for making calculations instead of using the Perez Model? 

I understand that the Daylight Coefficients would not directly apply since the luminance distribution would be unknown? Is it too bad to consider the direct illuminance as it is, and assume the diffuse illuminance as isotropic (i.e. assume the diffuse daylight entering through my window is the same as the horizontal) ???

THANKS

Yes, that would be very bad. There is no such thing as an uniform sky in 
nature.

Maybe John's chapter on sky model is interesting for you:

Hello everybody,


is it possible to calculate the RGB irradiance values from a HDR-image
(generated by Rpict)?
So I'm trying to use the "photographic film/sensor" of  the "camera" as a
photosensor.

I am trying to do use a HDR image, since I want to apply various masks on
the HDR image.
So I am trying to cut out various sections of my photographic film, and
placing a photosensor / lux-meter on the cut-out sections of the
photographic film.

I was hoping to use something like this:

rmagic basic.hdr | rtrace \-i+ \-dv \-h\- \-ab 3 scene.oct > output1a
rmagic basic.hdr | rtrace \-i+ \-dv \-h\- \-ab 3 scene.oct | rcalc -e
'$1=(0.67*$1+0.265*$2+0.065*$3)*179'  > output1b

Hi Dolf,

If your hdr image is created using rpict with the -i option than you can
use pvalue to extract the pixel irradiance values.
pvalue -da -h -H basic.hdr > basic_RGB.txt

If you just want to apply masks you can use pcomb with if statements like
this:
pcomb -e 'ro=if(ri(2),ri(1),0);go=if(gi(2),gi(1),0);bo=if(bi(2),bi(1),0)'
basic.hdr mask1.hdr > basic_mask1.hdr

If your hdr images were not generated using rpict -i you could use vwrays
and rtrace to generate the illuminance data files for your image:
vwrays -x 500 -y 500 -vf view.vf | rtrace -i -ab 3 scene.oct > output.txt

Hope this helps,
Andy

Hi Dolf,

is it that you want to trace rays for image pixels dependent on their 
pixel value? So something like "if (pixel_red >=.5) then rtrace 
pixel_origin pixel_direction"? For that, you can use rcalc, which 
understands float triples (aka pixels values) as input, and can output 
either valid origin/direction vectors or nul-vectors depending on the input.

Cheers, Lars.

Cheers, Lars.

Thanks for the response.



Andrew, your subjects are what I was looking for.

Though I am still not there yet ...  However, first I?ll try to play a
little more with it.



Lars, unfortunately that's not what I'm trying. When I made some more
progress and I am better capable to describe the problem, then I'll send
you a small update.



Thanks again!



Dolf

I'm not an expert on the pcond code, but it's probably applying different tone mapping depending on what it interprets as lux levels in the scene. If you give it a scene from gendaylit -O 2, pcond doesn't know that the pixel value RGB triplets have already been scaled to luminance, and thinks it's a brighter scene, and applies a brighter tone map. If you gave it a scene illuminated to only 10 lux of electric light, it would probably give you a different tone mapping even if the contrast ratios were identical.

Can anyone else corroborate my guess?

Hi, and thank you for your reply!!

If I select the output of gendaylit -O 2 (lm/m^2/sr) then I generate the picture using rpict, convert to human visual response using pcond
-h and then to bmp using ra_bmp then I get a picture that is visually more brighter than if I select the output of gendaylit -O 0 (default) and then
multiply by 179.

I confirm, when I use -O 2 (output lm/m^2/sr) then I don't multiply by 179, only when I select the default output (W/m^2/sr).

I don't have problem with the results of the values, but with the generated picture, using the default of the parameter -O the picture looks less brighter
(even after *179).

I wonder which of the two pictures is the right one, as it doesn't seem to have anything to do with the results of the values, but with the way how the image
is created...I guess...


I really apprecieate your help!

:)

2013/8/5 Christopher Rush <Christopher.Rush at arup.com<mailto:Christopher.Rush at arup.com>>
Can you clarify the exact process when you say the picture looks less bright? The picture out of pcond is just visually less bright? If you're looking at values prior to using pcond, your process to get values out of your image is probably based on the assumption that the scene is set up using defaults (visible W/m^2/sr). If you convert to lumens in your scene description from gendaylit, then you have to be careful that you're not again converting to lumens (with a 179 multiplier) after your calculation.

Subject: [Radiance-general] pcond, luminance or visible radiation?

Hi all, I'd appreciate your help on the following question:

I'm creating a radiance scene using gendaylit to generate the sky, since I have data of the diffuse horizontal and direct normal irradiance (W/m^2) I'm using the -W option and then -O 2 to obtain the output in lm/m^2/sr (luminance). Then I'm using rpict to generate the picture, and pcond -h to convert it to a human visual response.

But I realized that if I use the default value of -O in gendaylit (output in radiance of the visible radiation W/m^2/sr) the picture looks less bright.

So I don't know which one is the right one to use in this case.

I tried to find out if the default input when using pcond would be luminance rather than visible radiation, but couldn't find an answer for that, or maybe there is another command other than pcond, that takes the input in luminance values, then that would be the one I should use.
Or maybe there is an additional step that I'm missing...

I wonder if somebody can give me a hint about this, and/or where to look..  :)

Thanks in advance!!

Ch.

Thank you Christopher...your explanation kind of make sense to me, but yes
would be great to know
what is the real issue behind the differences between the two pictures and
if there is a way of getting
one that really matches the results of the calculations (or which one of
the 2 is that)  :)
so I hope that someone can bring more light to this question...

Thanks again for your help!!  :)

Good morning all,

Looking forward to the day's presentations! In order to help move things along, let's all make sure we are good to go on the conferencing tools. 

You need to log on to this url:

http://www.mymeetings.com/nc/join.php?i=748078570&p=1653&t=c

...and then enter this info:
Meeting number:        748078570
Meeting passcode:      1653

This will get you onto the webcast. You need to do this whether you are at NREL or remote. You need to have Java enabled, and you will need a plugin as well. Please try getting onto the site well before your presentation slot! Once you are on, we will be able to transfer control to you at the appropriate time. During Q&A, I will be transferring control to the next presenter's system, so we'll lose your slides. I'll try and wait till the last minute in case you need to reference your presentation during the Q&A. 

We will do a better job of fielding questions from the webcast attendees as well. 

To hear what's going on, call one of these numbers:
1-210-516-8514           1-877-960-9637
...and enter this code:
Passcodes:
Participant: 8824531

Please mute your phones, if you are not presenting! (At any given time, that means, like, all of you.)

We'll be going live in a little bit, "see" you then. 

- Rob

Howdy folks, 

Looking forward to the workshop next week! Here are some final details for you as you prepare -- better late than never, eh?

All Presenters:
We would like to have the slide decks pre-loaded if at all possible, especially for days 2 and 3, so that the transitions occur smoothly. Please (please?) upload your slide decks to:

http://dbinbox.com/rpg777

...when they are ready. The night before is totally fine, even the morning of.  Remote presenters, this includes you too! We will work with you if you absolutely must use your own computer, but we would like to minimize that. If you are planning to use your own computer, please see "Remote attendees and presenters", below.

Attending in person:
Be sure to bring your government-issued PHOTO ID, and this goes double-triple for foreign nationals. We got word today that all paperwork is in order with NREL Security, but they will not let you on campus without your required ID (passport, visa, etc -- that is all spelled out in the FNDC forms you filled out). 

Between Jennifer's Doodle poll, Greg's email, and Mudit's Doodle poll(s), I think you all have multiple methods for getting together on rideshare, should you wish to do so.

Arriving at NREL:
Here's all you need to know about that:
http://www.nrel.gov/about/golden.html
Security knows what you're here for (so does the NSA), and we will have hosts to escort you, but FYI we are meeting in the San Juan Conference Room in the RSF, all three days. 

Remote attendees and presenters:
To access the screencast, hit up this url:
http://www.mymeetings.com/nc/join.php?i=748078570&p=1653&t=c

...and then enter this info:
Meeting number:        748078570
Meeting passcode:      1653

You will be able to view the presentation, and we will give remote presenters control of the show when needed. 

To hear what's going on, call one of these numbers:
1-210-516-8514           1-877-960-9637

...and enter this code:
Passcodes:
Participant: 8824531

Certain dialing restrictions can apply from specific countries. See this link for details:
https://www.mymeetings.com/audioconferencing/pdf/GlobalAccessDialingInformation.pdf

That's it for now, until I remember all the other stuff I was supposed to tell you. Safe travels, and see you next week. We'll leave the lights off for ya (get it?)!

Could you make the Radiance Workshop presentations available with the audio

Hi Shamim,

The presentations were recorded separately, and will be compiled into movie files with the slides, the audio, and video of the presenters (or so I'm told). As soon as those are produced, we'll get them posted somewhere and links will be made available. Hopefully those will be ready in a few days.

Hi Everyone,

The past 3 days of the Radiance Workshops were fantastic. Many people
approached me asking about resources for learning Grasshopper, so below is
a short list.

McNeel has their own in-person and online training courses.
http://www.rhino3d.com/training/United_States/

On the Grasshopper website there are some useful tutorials, especially the
one by LIFTArchitects.
http://www.grasshopper3d.com/page/tutorials-1

Several others, some with video content.

I have a question regarding the 5-phase method. If gendaymtx had an option

Leyla,

I understand the gendaymtx program has an option to create skies without
sun. However, I also understand that the second term of the 5phase method
intends to subtract the direct sun, but leaving there the inter-reflected
sun. That is, all the sun's contributions are calculated on the first term
(3phase method), and then, all those rays going directly from the sky to
the window are eliminated, but leaving the rays that come from the sun and
first bounce on the exterior scene.

Short answer is NO? I hope I understand, hahaha? my head hurt after that
day, haha.

Bye!

Hi Andy,

I was interested in Ladan Ghobad's presentation on the third day of the
Radiance Workshop (Thesis, NC State) but could not attend the session
because of conflicts.  That particular session's slides have not been
uploaded on the radiance site.  Any way to access them?

Regards.

Hi Shamim, 

I never did get Ladan's slides, but I will get them soon and I'll send you a copy, as I think Andy's on vacation at the moment. 

Eventually they'll all be on the radiance-online site, and the recordings too.

Hi Ladan,

Thanks for writing to me.  How is Wayne and Jian doing?  I wanted to come
by and see them.  Any new student for daylight this fall?

Best,
Shamim.

OK folks, the Radiance Workshop recordings are now available on NREL's OpenStudio YouTube channel!

We split the morning and afternoon programs from each day into their own streams, plus there is one for the NREL campus panel discussion from Tuesday afternoon. The entire 18 hours(!) of content can be accessed in order from the following playlist link:

http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPk2tlcZM0gydvEW0VFgZLZ3S8eSbi-cx

Unfortunately the recording timed out early on some days, so Kera Lagios' DIVA for Rhino demo is unceremoniously halted about halfway through, and the OpenStudio demo does not appear at all. Jack DeValpine makes a fast exit at the end of day two as well. Apologies all around on that score. With compressed video and small type being what they are, you also might want to avail yourself of the high resolution copies of all the presenter slide decks Andy McNeil and LBNL have made available at radiance-online.org:

http://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2013-golden-co

We left the dead time during the coffee breaks in the streams, so you can pretend you were actually there. Just play back, and during the breaks make small talk about the 5-phase method with your cat. 

One last time, I want to say it was a pleasure and an honor to be able to host the workshop this year. Enjoy!

I've (finally) posted a tarball containing BSDFviewer for linux:
http://www.radiance-online.org/download-install/bsdf-viewer

simply unpack the tar, run sudo ./install.sh and it hopefully works, at
least on ubuntu.

Send bugs and errors to me and I'll try to trouble shoot them.

I want to say a big thank you to Rob for editing and posting the videos so
quickly.

You'll also noticed that i've posted a zip file containing all
presentations for connivence and a zip file of Greg's workshop photos on
the workshop website.

Also, an album of Greg's photos has been uploaded to Radiance's facebook
website so go tag yourself and your friends:

Message-ID: <A61CFDD5-10DD-4301-B294-2262E95E0DCD@cin.uni-tuebingen.de>

Dear Radiance experts,

When defining the geometry of objects in .rad files, is it possible to use variables and basic maths functions (especially trigonometric functions)? Standard bash syntax doesn't seem to work in that case (i.e. xPos = 5 and $xPos).

Specifically, the coordinates of some of my objects change as a function of angle. So instead of recalculating all the x, y, and z coordinates by hand it would be really useful to just define a new angle and let Radiance's oconv program use the updated Cartesian coordinates.

I somehow have this deep belief that this should be possible :)

If you know a clever way to do this, please let me know.

Best wishes,
Michael

Dear Michael,

Have you had a look at the xform command?
http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/man_html/xform.1.html

It might just do what you are trying to achieve.


Best,

Giovanni

ah, of course! i remember that being mentioned in the tutorial :) that might actually do all of the tasks that i had in mind because that command - as i understand it - can be called from within a bash script where i can define the geometric layout in more abstract terms.
thank you!

Hi Michael,

you can use xform for most cases, but a very generic approach is to use !echo "$myVariable". You just have to export the variable before calling a Radiance command parsing the file. All lines starting with ! are expanded when the scene is parsed, so this is a generic method to include any text (which can be parameters for materials, geometries, complete Radiance scene objects).

Cheers, Lars.

There are also examples in the tutorials and in the list archives of using 'cnt' and the Radiance functional language to do all kinds of fun stuff.

Hello,

Apologies for asking something that is not directly related to the radiance
software.

I wish to know field experiences of using high dynamic range (HDR)
photography for interior lighting quality assessment. Can anyone please
point me to the right direction of resources?

Regards,

Tanvir

Hi Tanvir,

There was an excellent talk related to this at the recent Radiance workshop, given by Kevin Van Den Wymelenberg.  The PDF of his slides (large) is at:

	http://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2013-golden-co/VanDenWymelenberg-LuminanceMetrics.pdf

The parent webpage has links to the actual presentation videos:

	http://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2013-golden-co

The talk was in the first afternoon session:

	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmACL4gejp0&list=PLPk2tlcZM0gydvEW0VFgZLZ3S8eSbi-cx&index=2

Kevin starts talking around the 47 minute mark.

I recommend you also check out the research of Dr. Mehlika Inanici at U. Washington:

	http://faculty.washington.edu/inanici/MI-RESEARCH.html

I am cross-posting this to the HDRI mailing list, where you might prefer to follow up.  (You should subscribe first if you aren't on that list already.)

Cheers,
-Greg

Dear all,

Does anyone know how Radiance calculates how much of an incoming light ray
is reflected and how much is transmitted dependent on the angle of
incidence?

You need to *add* -bn Ntbins after your -f tregenza.cal argument.  Don't remove the -b option -- you need that as well.

The original rtcontrib didn't absolutely require -bn, although it should have.  The new rcontrib (which "rtcontrib" points to) does.

Best,
-Greg

Hi Amalie,

the answer depends on the material model you choose. Check material.pdf
which comes with the Radiance distribution. Peter Apian-Bennewitz
recently published a nice article giving an overview on the various
models and their implications: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1307.4214.pdf

Cheers, Lars.

Message-ID: <CAOG+NiyW4fKMT8O_zGKxifDVjKni7Tzgto5GtHMq2uCr=nqLLg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Everyone,

I've posted a five-phase simulation tutorial:
http://www.radiance-online.org/learning/tutorials (bottom of the page).

Also posted is a script that runs the two examples provided in the
tutorial.  You need to have radiance installed, but that's about it.  The
script downloads geometry and files needed for the simulation.  It's
written in bash so it should work on Mac or Linux (sorry windows).

Best,
Andy

Subject: [Radiance-general] Three-phase method: more questions
Message-ID: <CAO0Bi3UdDQsC8EVw=GqUi21NORdNjGhmN5gdLR6YNcCOCwWhFw@mail.gmail.com>

I'm also (as many) following the Three-phase method of Andy Mcneil, at
first I tried to play with my own files but now I'm literally going step by
step using the files of the method.

But I still get stuck in many 'need help' moments,I hope that someone finds
time to give me a hand with this.

I'm using the 'Example 1' on section 3:

1) When trying to use the created daylight matrix: south.dmx with
dctimestep (3.4 putting all together)
I obtain the following message: fatal-unexpected EOF reading
results/south.dmx

2) I wonder if might this have anything to do with the fact that I'm using
an CFS.xml file that was obtained with a gonio-photometer, instead of using
the Window 7 software.

3) That leads to the question if I should still use the genklemsamp to
create the daylight matrix if later I will use *.xml files obtained with
the gonio-photometer which is based in the tregenza subdivision.

4) I have an 'only one' file that uses the klems angle basis, but if I try
to use that one I get the following msg: fatal-file format error: BSDF
cfs.xml : top level node not 'WindowElement'

I'll appreciate any help regarding these issues...

Thanks in advance!!

Chantal.

Chantal,

For now the Three-phase method does nos support other basis than full
Klems' 145 patches on each hemisphere. You should check that your .xml
BSDFs are in that basis, and in the correct format.

I understand Tregenza and Klems subdivitions are different, but both of
them have 145 patches...? If the .xml format is correct, you should get no
errors but an incorrect answer...?

On the other hand:
*1) When trying to use the created daylight matrix: south.dmx with
dctimestep (3.4 putting all together)
I obtain the following message: fatal-unexpected EOF reading
results/south.dmx*

I guess this could be because the sky subdivitions chosen for the Sky are
different when calling the gendaymtx and rcontrib programs? Chek the -m
option in gendaymtx and the MF: option in rcontrib.

Hope it helps,

German

Chantal,

Since this is the second time in the last two weeks that someone has
erroneously attributed the three-phase method to me, I'll point out that
Greg Ward is responsible for the Three-Phase method.  I simply wrote the
tutorial.

Also, German offers good advice!

Forgot to mention that the "n" option of dctimestep requires as input the
number of timesteps on the SkyMtx... you cannot simulate half of the file.

Yes, you've no doubt identified one of the main difficulties in understanding a functional language.  Everything is defined in terms of everything else, and there's no explicit "flow" to a program, which is really just a set of equations.  Only when something is evaluated does anything happen, then whatever variables and functions that evaluation requires causes a cascade that leads to inputs that are somehow predefined in the environment.

In the case of .cal files used in a Radiance rendering, most of these variables and functions are given or described in rayinit.cal.  Similarly, the direction vector (Dx,Dy,Dz) and world position (Px,Py,Pz) variables are the ones used primarily by .cal files given on the rcontrib command line.  You will see these mentioned in the comments and main section of tregenza.cal.

The best introduction to .cal files is probably still Chapter 4 of "Rendering with Radiance," which you can order from Randolph Fritz if you don't already have a copy.

Best,
-Greg

Would anyone know a good resource I could look into that could help? Is it a linux thing? To give you a hint of where I'm coming from: I have some reasonable understanding of languages like Python, Ruby and a little C# but am fairly illiterate when it comes to Linux.

	too bright"
Message-ID: <2C27481A-9DB2-4C16-A7E3-DB6A40397A63@cin.uni-tuebingen.de>

Dear Radiance community,

I would like to do spectral rendering with Radiance using the N-step algorithm (Ruppertsberg & Bloj, 2008, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18411553 ). The idea is to model surface reflectance in terms of average radiance per waveband rather than RGB values.

I tried to run their demo code and I think I'm really close to reproducing their results :) However, when I run their bash script, I cannot get rid of the following error:

"pfilt: picture too dark or too bright
pvalue: missing resolution"

I suspect that my definition of the light source is not processed properly in the scene description. (On the other hand it does NOT tell me that "no light source" has been found.) Anyway, there is nothing to see in the resulting image.

I created my light source using ies2rad, as described in that paper. It didn't work right away so I had to make a few adjustments. For example, no lamp type was specified in the original code. So I called ies2rad with the "-t default" option.

Here is the file that was created by ies2rad :

# ies2rad -p stimuli/radiance/hyperspectral/Ruppertsberg-BRM-2008/ -c 0.000387 0.000422 0.000435 -o mylight -t default

I would typically get too dark/light errors if the view is incorrectly oriented and not seeing any geometry. It's a simple thing, but easy to forget to check, or misinterpret coordinates, particularly if there are xform commands involved or missing.

Hi Michael,

You may have hit the lower limit of what pfilt considers "non-black."  Your light source values are so low that when multiplied by a small solid angle and surface reflectance, the average could be too small for pfilt to notice.  If you use the "-1" option to pfilt, I don't think you will get this error.

Also, I would like to point you to the 2002 paper I wrote with Elena on tristimulus color approximations, in case you haven't seen it:

Subject: [Radiance-general] the -r option
Message-ID: <CAOtcj_wPHwMomu7ivcYBGpEDQdaeWQRk7qoa6Sbm7xC6C+Vx6w@mail.gmail.com>

hello,
I have a model from rhino which i exported to .3ds, then i imported  it
into sketchup in order to simplify the model and then finally i exported it
again in .3ds
After that, i imported it in ecotect because i want to do some lighthing
analysis and used radiance as well.
Even though I simplified the model I am still having the "set overflow in
addobject" error.
I read that i can change the -r option by powers of two until the problem
is fixed and i can render properly.  The question is:
Where and how can I change that -r option?
Cheers,

THat error is rarely seen any more, if you are using a recent version of Radiance (oconv, actually). You can also try .obj format instead of .3ds. Both of these approaches will require you to use Radiance from the command line, though. It sounds like you're trying to use the Ecotect GUI for everything, which may not be possible -- I have no idea for certain, because I don't have a copy of Ecotect.

Message-ID: <CAN1QwsOg6ieyoQA+t4gKSsEzfLUX43O9=vmtduTqmMnXP=PNFw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list,

Following example 1 in 5-phase method tutorial, I am trying to model
venetian blinds with frosted glass as blind material. The properties of the
glass are as follows:

Visible Transmittance: 67%
Reflectance: 18%
Clarity (small-angle scattering): 4%
Thickness: 8mm

To generate accurate BSDF files, I thought I should model the blind slats
as trans material, but I am struggling with translating above properties
into trans material modifiers.
I'd appreciate it if you helped me with writing the blind material script.
Also, I am not sure where to include the glass thickness. genblinds does
not seem to have an option for blind thickness.
Does the glass thickness in this case affect the BSDF results?

Thanks,
Leyla

Thanks for your replies!

Yes, the code ran without problems when using the "-1" option. But I still cannot see anything. I also tried larger light source values in the -c option of ies2rad command but that didn't help either.

Since that code was a supplement of the main article, I was actually expecting it to run a little bit more smoothly...

Michael

Besides the larger values, are you sure your light source surfaces have their normals facing into the room?

Your light source values are so low that when multiplied by a small solid angle and surface reflectance, the average could be too small for pfilt to notice.  If you use the "-1" option to pfilt, I don't think you will get this error.

Hi Leyla,

I was thinking someone else might answer this one, as a lot of folks have worked on similar things, but here goes...

Figuring out Radiance "trans" parameters is a classic challenge, and there are a few spreadsheets out there to make this a bit easier.  The basic reference is section 5.2.6 from "Rendering with Radiance," attached below for your convenience.  (Responders please delete attachment in your replies.)

Plugging in your parameters of:

Ts = .04
Td = .67 - .04 = .63
Rd = .18
Rs = 0 (guessing no clear reflections)

These yield:

A7 = Ts/(Td+Ts) = .04/(.63+.04) = .0597

A6 = (Td+Ts)/(Rd+Td+Ts) = (.63+.04)/(.18+.63+.04) = .7882

A5 = 0 (adjust if you want to scatter your transmitted rays a bit)

A4 = Rs = 0

A1 = A2 = A3 = .18/((1-0)*(1-A6) = .18/(1-.7882) = .85 (assumes uncolored material)

So, there's your material:

	void trans frosted_glass
	0
	0
	7 0.85 0.85 0.85 0 0 0.7882 0.0597

Regarding thickness, so long as the distance between slats is 16 cm or greater, you needn't worry about it.  If they are closer together, you may want to use the xform -a option to create your own array of slats.  It's actually pretty simple -- genblinds isn't doing that much for you with flat slats, anyway.

Cheers,
-Greg
