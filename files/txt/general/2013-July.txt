Message-ID: <51D48143.5050206@visarc.com>

Hi All,

For those who are interested, I just posted an entry on how to sample 
virtual work-planes within a scene for the V matrix calculation of the 
three phase simulation method.

Subject: [Radiance-general] PhD Studentship: A novel camera-based approach
 to measure daylight exposure for conservation/management of light-sensitive
 objects in heritage buildings
Message-ID: <3A8CC20D-7C6C-4C0D-A2F5-4E44EED08540@lboro.ac.uk>

PhD Studentship: A novel camera-based approach to measure daylight exposure for conservation/management of light-sensitive objects in heritage buildings

Loughborough University - School of Civil and Building Engineering

http://www.jobs.ac.uk/job/AGV407/phd-studentship/

Background to the research
=================

Many heritage buildings contain light sensitive objects, e.g. paintings, fabrics, wallpapers, furnishings etc. Management of the long-term exposure of these objects to daylight is a key issue for the bodies that have responsibility for managing the buildings and preserving their contents, e.g. The National Trust. It is acknowledged that systematic monitoring of light exposure is very sparse, and also that many valuable objects are at risk. Monitoring, if carried out at all, is usually just at one or two points in a space. However, the spatial variation in long-term exposure is believed to be great- typically several orders of magnitude depending on the geometry and reflective properties of the space. The installation of commonly used measurement apparatus can be invasive, expensive and/or impractical.

Aim
===

This project will employ a novel combination of measurement, GPS, photogrammetry and modeling to quantify the spatial distribution of cumulative daylight exposure in spaces, with a particular application to the management and conservation of light sensitive objects in heritage buildings. The research will include the following tasks:

Demonstrate and validate in the laboratory that long-term cumulative light exposure can be determined by proxy means using automated high dynamic range (HDR) image capture.

Combine HDR and photogrammetry to recreate the full 3D illumination field from the 2D images.

Replicate and validate the approach ?in the field', i.e. in a suitable heritage space.

Develop visualisation tools to analyse, reduce and present cumulative illuminance data for conservators and building managers.

The position
========

The School of Civil and Building Engineering at Loughborough University invites applications for a PhD studentship from individuals interested in fusing light modelling with modern spatial measurement techniques. A background in physics/engineering/mathematics or related discipline will be required, combined with some expertise in software development using Matlab/IDL. As part of a large, growing and supportive research community within the School, the successful candidate will benefit from the University?s Graduate School and their extensive and targeted skills training for research students. The successful candidate will be joining a lively community of research students and staff, where doctoral students are given great academic and administrative support and are an integral part of the University's research culture.

PhD Studentship: Applicability of climate-based daylight modelling - research into practice

Loughborough University -School of Civil and Building Engineering

http://www.jobs.ac.uk/job/AGV427/phd-studentship/

The position
========

Applications are invited for a PhD Studentship starting in October 2013 to undertake research in climate-based daylight modelling and its application to solve traditional, novel and emerging problems in the daylighting design of buildings at all scales from individual spaces to urban settings. The work will be supervised by Prof. John Mardaljevic (Loughborough University) and Dr. Francesco Anselmo (Arup, London).

To be of practical use in industry, the disparate strands of CBDM research need to be synthesised to create a robust and authoritative modelling framework - one that has well defined stages, methodologies, quality assurance procedures, etc. CBDM has been applied to a wide range of real-world projects, e.g., daylighting for museums. But it is still an unknown methodology for most practitioners.

CBDM is constantly evolving, so one of the challenges will be to capture this 'moving target' and give shape and coherence to the future development of CBDM. In addition to working closely with industry, the project is aligned with the aims of two International Commission for Illumination (CIE) Technical Committees on CBDM and Daylighting. Thus the project will have significant impact on the future use and development of CBDM in both research and practice.

The candidate will work in close collaboration with Arup, and be expected to undertake visits/internships at Arup offices in London lasting a minimum of approximately three months over the duration of the project.


Funding and eligibility
==============

The studentship is open to graduates from numerate disciplines who are interested in daylight simulation. The minimum entry qualification is a 2.1 Honours degree or equivalent. A lower qualification is acceptable if supplemented with an appropriate postgraduate (MSc) qualification and relevant experience.

The studentship, funded by an EPSRC CASE award, is for 3.5 years and covers fees and a tax-exempt stipend of ?13,726 (with additional top-up of approximately ?1,000 per year) for the 2013/2014 academic year with cost of living adjustments in years 2 and 3. Tuition fees will be paid at the UK/EU rate.

Hi there-

I work in the architecture field and I'm interested in just processing the
raw data that radiance generates instead of looking at images that might be
generated.  I want to build my own spatial mapping of illuminance values in
another visualization tool.  Sorry for the newbie question!

How would I do that?  Can anyone lend some hints of where I would look to
see this, files, etc?

Thanks,

Dear List,

Apologies to the all for the spate of (mostly outdated) posts.  For some reason, a bunch of posts ended up in the list "jail" and were recently freed by Daniel Fuller, our site administrator.  Check the dates to make sure these haven't been responded to already before you post a reply.

Some of the posts have never appeared before, and could use some attention.

Chien,
If you have rendered images you can use pvalue to extract pixel data.  Make
sure you use rpict -i if you what illuminance instead of luminance values.
Or you can use rtrace -I to generate illuminance data for a grid of points.
Best,
Andy

Chien,
I see that this post is over a month old, apparently it was trapped in the
mailing list jail.

Radiance is developed primarily by Greg Ward, via a part-time contract with
LBNL.   In good years LBNL receives meager funding for Radiance from the US
Department of Energy and/or California Energy Commission.  In bad years
Greg has provided support without recieving anything in return.  There have
also been some people that have paid Greg directly to develop new features.


Maybe we should add a full list those who have provided funds at
radiance-online.org.

Howdy all,

Guess what's in five weeks? Yeah, that's right, the Radiance Workshop! 

http://www.nrel.gov/buildings/2013_radiance_workshop.html

NREL is thrilled to play host to you all, and we look forward to a nice turnout for the 12th annual celebration of that plucky ray tracer known as Radiance. Developed at LBNL and EPFL, Radiance continues to evolve, as do utilities and interfaces for the Radiance engine. Come out to NREL in sunny Golden, CO, USA August 12-14 2013, and share/see what's been going on in the Radiance community, meet your colleagues, and see some Radiance-influenced, daylit buildings on NREL's campus.

Day 1 will feature presentations and demos on core Radiance additions, and interfaces. *Please* consider giving a presentation on your own work/experience with Radiance during days 2 and 3. Participant presentations really are the heart of the workshop; I will post a preliminary schedule of speakers soon. Meanwhile, I need more speakers! Don't be shy. Your work with Radiance begets more funding for core development, after all. 

Registration is free, but dinner is on you this time around. This is what is known as a good deal. Please see the url above for details about the workshop, and see below for details on getting to and staying in Golden:

http://www.nrel.gov/about/golden_info.html

This is a not-so-subtle prod to get you to email me -- if you haven't already -- your intent to participate in the workshop. If you are a foreign national, please send me your email ASAP so we can get your visitor paperwork started. ASAP, as in NOW. 

Looking forward to seeing you here next month.

The format will be the same as in recent years, with the first day being full of tutorials and software demonstrations, and days two and three reserved for presentations of work you've done with Radiance over the last year.

On day one, we will have Greg Ward presenting on new features/functionality added to the Radiance code since last year's workshop, as well as a primer on BSDFs and their generation with, and use in, Radiance. Andy McNeil may even have a few words about an enhanced daylight coefficient method that Radiance is being adapted to utilize (those kooks at Berkeley decided three phases weren't enough). Jan Weinold (Fraunhofer ISE) will be talking about his glare metric (DGP) and his tool (Evalglare), while a mystery guest from Boise, ID will offer additional perspectives on glare metrics.  Kera Lagios (Solemma LLC / Lam Partners) will be giving a demo on DIVA, and members of NREL's Commercial Buildings Research Goup will be giving a demo on whole building energy simulations with Radiance and EnergyPlus, using the OpenStudio Application Suite and SDK.  

Days two and three are what *you* make of them, really.  Time slots for user presentations will be contingent on how many people we get to come out, but figure about 20 minutes per person. What has Radiance done for you lately? We all want to know/see! 

We will be webcasting the workshop, so if you can't make it out to Colorado, no worries, you can enjoy the proceedings from wherever you are, via the intertubes. We will also be recording the presentations and posting them online for future viewing.

This event will take place on NREL's main campus, in one of our newest buildings, the Research Support Facility (RSF) which is one of the largest net-zero energy facilities in the entire world. Daylighting was a core component of the integrated high-performance building design, and its performance was predicted with Radiance. Come see a real life example of the power of Radiance's predictive capability! We also have a nicely daylit cafeteria parking garage, and a new building (ESIF) housing first of its kind grid-level simulation and physical test facilities, and a rather zippy supercomputer which will be online by the time you all come out here. We'll try and tour as many of these facilities while you're here as well. More on the buildings, here:

http://www.nrel.gov/esi/esif.html
http://www.nrel.gov/sustainable_nrel/buildings_garage.html
http://www.nrel.gov/sustainable_nrel/buildings_cafe.html

Lastly, I am happy to announce that there will be no registration fee, for speakers and students. (!) The usual banquet/dinner will be an out of pocket expense, but hey, registration is free, so quit complaining. Seriously, we'll find a place that can feed us all and we'll have a good time and make inspiring speeches. 

We will be posting a web page with all this info and more, but I wanted to get the word out so you can mark your calendars and start planning. Oh, and to that end, NREL is located in Golden, CO, USA, which is about 15 miles west of Denver. If you're flying in, you'd want to fly into Denver International (KDEN). More on getting here, here:
http://www.nrel.gov/about/golden.html

More on staying here, here:
http://www.nrel.gov/about/golden_info.html

Since there is no registration fee, registration is simple. Send an email to me (robert.guglielmetti at nrel.gov).  If you are a foreign national, there is extra paperwork we need to do. If you are from Iran, Syria, Cuba, or , unfortunately you will not be able to attend in person. However, since we are webcasting the event, we will be able to support those of you from these countries who cannot attend in person by allowing you to present via webex. Please let me know ASAP if you will need this option.

Please do the following, ASAP:
- Email me your intent to participate in Golden: 
- Please indicate your citizenship status. 
- Please indicate whether you're coming for day one, two, three or some combination thereof.
- Please submit a brief abstract on your presentation.

Thanks for reading, and we're looking forward to seeing you all in beautiful Colorado in a few months! 

P.S.
Bring your hiking boots.

Hi Imran,

If you downloaded the installer from the NREL page between June 16 and about an hour ago, I apologize ? that one was messed up. Please download the new version there now, and *follow* the instructions on the download page for setting your environment (PATH and RAYPATH), and you should be good to go.

Hello,
I have to install radiance, I installed radiance by downloading from http://www.radiance-online.org/download-install/installation-information/windows-installation. But it lacks a lot of things. Does anyone know how to install from source code? or is there any other proper windows install available?

Subject: [Radiance-general] Finding contribution of different glass roof
 panels using r(t)contrib
Message-ID: <2FD230DE27B46640A9F52CC136F848D1BBA4D9@a10ex01.atelierten.com>

Dear all,

I've been following some of the discussions on the mailing list with keen interest and gratitude. Now, I'd like to hear your thoughts on something I'm working on. (Hopefully, I'll be able to start answering other people's questions soon too!)

I'm working on a building with a large glass roof, with plants and people inside. The goal is to find optimal light transmittances for different parts of the roof so it is relatively uniformly lit throughout the year. The main worry is getting enough light for the plants, yet limiting irradiance to not require excessive cooling.

Here's what I am thinking at the moment:

*         Break up dome into N separate panels using Rhino/Grasshopper, assign each panel to a layer, and then export layers as materials using DIVA

*         Generate a materials file with N identical materials with material_i as name

*         Run r(t)contrib for the different modifiers (using -M and a modifier file)  and points, using a cumulative sky generated by DIVA, to find to each point by each panel

*         Visualise output data using Rhino/Grasshopper

*         Find (near) optimum light transmittances based on 2-3 criteria (still to be defined, but likely UDI and uniformity). With the available data is should a purely numerical exercise, no simulations involved.

I've tested the separate steps but not yet the whole workflow. I may need to extend the simulation by doing an hourly simulation to obtain useful daylight illuminances, probably by creating genskyvec+rtcontrib-loop, like in Axel Jacobs' rtcontrib tutorial. That may get computationally intensive, in which case I may resort to using EC2.

A few questions:

*         Any experiences with something similar? Ways to simplify /improve my workflow? Which errors will I likely run into?

*         obj2rad generates an interpolated .rad file using texfunc.cal and something called 'M-nor'. This means I can't use my material as a modifier for rcontrib. For now, I have exported my model as simple planes so that the materials can be used as modifiers, but is there a better way?

*         Should I use a CPU-optimised instance on EC2? What are some ways to properly do parallel computing on EC2? Any examples?

*         An alternative is using one material for the dome and creating a custom binning for rtcontrib. Does this have any computational advantages?

Any help greatly appreciated!

Hi Reinier,

You should probably take a look at the "three-phase method" which breaks 
flux transfer down into three discrete steps:

 1. sky to glazing exterior
 2. transmission through glazing
 3. glazing interior to built environment

Glazing transmission (2) is accounted for via a BSDF representation. The 
nice thing about this is that if you want to change glass 
type/performance you do not end up having to re-run a complex 
simulation, it is a matter of recomputing a matrix calculation. In other 
words, the material behavior of the glazing is a separate step and does 
not actually take that long. Andy McNeil has a great tutorial on using 
this method:

http://www.radiance-online.org/learning/tutorials/Tutorial-ThreePhaseMethod.pdf

I recently worked on a project using this method. The main goal was to 
evaluate daylight based on hourly weather data for the locale for plant 
growth within a selected exhibition environment. Using this approach, 
was a big help when we needed to look at some other glazing options.

This does requires some setup work particularly if you are looking at 
rooftop glazing. You will also want to think carefully about how far you 
want to break down the glazing panels, whether individual panels or 
grouping of some sort.

If you are calculating sensor points you may find that you can do it on 
your workstation, however AWS/EC2 is definitely worth considering as an 
option. I did use AWS/EC2 for final runs as I did not want to have to 
wait, however I was generating images...

Hope this helps.

-Jack

Hi Aloisio,

Apologies, the Windows Radiance installer that was on the NREL website a couple of months ago was no good (it was a debug build). It has since been updated with a release build, so please re-download the installer and try again.

Sorry for the trouble!

I am not sure if the 3phase method is the best in this case, since the
accepted basis (145 Klems' division) is not very good for specular
fenestration systems (such as glazings).

Maybe a possible solution would be to make separate DC analysis for the
different fenestration groups (i.e. make all glazings black, except the one
to be analyzed) and somehow scale them by transmissivity...?? I mean:

For each glazing group:
     - Make every other glazing black, and this glazing with 100%
transmittance
     - Calculate DC.
end

then, the lighting levels would be

Lux= a1*DC1+a2*DC2+a3*DC3...

Does this make any sense?

Sorry for sending a second e-mail, I sent it by mistake.

a1, a2 and etc... are the transmissivities in my example (1 equals air, 0
equals black). But I am not sure if that linear scaling and adding is
valid...?


I am interested to see the solution you use!

THANKS

Hi,

Radzilla as it is publicly available has not seen much updates for years now, so I would not really build up new projects on it. The pmap development is going on, Jan had presented the 4.x-pmap extension on the workshop in Copenhagen. It is not available at the moment, so we have to wait until he can make any new announcements, but I would for sure prefer waiting for the new pmap to be polished and released instead of tweaking the old code.

Cheers, Lars.

Message-ID: <CAAd_PgR86AfWh_XCVZv7YnS2cUJBZQb4H8Fdho9BqGK2CgGRxg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I wonder if anybody has recommendations for modeling multi-layer ETFE
pillows similar to what you can see in this project: (
http://www.jmhdezhdez.com/2011/04/mediatic-media-tic-barcelona-etfe-efte.html
)

If you are not familiar with this system here is a video that shows how the
system [potentially] works: (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VSoUxvtiNo)

There are multiple layers of ETFE with different coating patterns. What is
the best way of modeling this system considering all the possible internal
reflections? Is this a good case for three-phase method daylight simulation?

Thanks in advance,
Mostapha

Hi Mostapha,

it depends on what results you are looking for.

If you need a useful model of the transmission through your fenestration, you may consider using the glass modifier. There is an error in this, as the refractive index of ETFE is lower (should be 1.4) than that of glass, however, for a clear, thin ETFE film, this may be rather ok for near-normal angles.

In some of the images, the ETFE did not seam to be clear. Probably it hat be printed, or some surface treatment had been applied to roughen it. In this case, you need to model the surface as it is, which has little to do with the pure material properties of ETFE. Probably you need some data on the transmission and reflection, provided by the manufacturer or by your own measurements. That would allow you to approximate a trans / transfunc material to your sample.

If you want to model something like patterns, where parts of the surface are printed and others are not, you can use mixfunc and mix the surface material with a clear ETFE material.

The multiple internal reflections would be accounted for when directly looking at the pillow. Bright spots by such reflections e.g. on a ceiling or wall would not appear. That would require secondary light sources (not very useful for the complex geometry), the pmap, or maybe a precalculated BSDF of one pillow.

Cheers, Lars.

Hi Lars,

Thank you for the reply. I think I need to try mixfunc as I want to study
multiple different patterns on different layers.

As far as I know pmap for the new version of Radiance is not currently
available, so I should probably try using BSDF material.

Thanks again,
Mostapha

Message-ID: <18EF33640F961B4BA442571DEB1356B3BB98DB7D@BELLATRIX.university.brighton.ac.uk>

Dear all.
Just wanted to announce the availability of LiVi version 0.3. LiVi is my add-on for Blender that acts as a pre/post-processor for Radiance. Major changes in this version are the use of gendaymtx for DDS, per-point numerical result display, and Radiance sky files can now be selected as a sky option. I've have done limited testing on linux (64bit) Windows 7 (64bit) and OS X 10.6/7 (32 & 64 bit).
LiVi can be downloaded for the LiVi website at http://arts.brighton.ac.uk/research/office-for-spatial-research/projects2/livi. LiVi is released under a GPL version 2 license and the code can be checked out at the Google Code repository https://code.google.com/p/livi/. Bug reports can also be left there. Questions, feedback etc can be posted to the LiVi mailing list at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/livi-list.  

Finally, have a super weekend.

Ryan

Hi Mostapha

as Lars said, it depends on the required exactness of your simulation.
Btw, 'glass' has the index of refraction as an optional 4th parameter.

As an approximation, choose a material and its parameters and/or use function 
files "by eye". If the resulting image looks right, - job done. However, that 
leaves the question why bother with Radiance and its complexity in the first 
place, considering that other renderers are perceived as being much friendlier 
to the user.

Measurements on the light scattering (BSDF) of a material take out the guess 
work, but are generally associated with costs. A number of companies sell 
different equipment and a number of companies offer measurement services (me 
included). Choosing a Radiance material is then based on solid data and the 
resulting model comes with a known error budget.

Or you can enquire about existing scattering data with the manufacturer of the 
product,- which you probably already have done in your case.

Otherwise, LBNL is building a database on window materials, so your product may 
already be in it.

And, if I may say so, the recently posted review 
(http://www.pab.eu/docs/Review_of_simulating_four_classes_of_window_materials_for_daylighting_with_non-standard_BSDF_using_simulation_program_Radiance.pdf) 
has all currently available Radiance window materials in one place. Including 
the every-now-and-then asked question about the difference between trans and 
transfunc. "Window" materials in this context means anything transmissive or 
translucent, so it is not specific to the usual coated, non-scattering panes . 
This compilation was started in March, when I realized I had already asked the 
same specific question to Greg in April 1995. So it started as a notebook to 
remind me of details, - maybe this list is useful to others too.

hope that helps, have a nice weekend,
best
Peter

Hi Peter,

Thank you so much for your informative email.

I hope the material provider has already the measurements done so I can use
their measurements for the study. I'm not sure though.

I have used .xml files generated by Window for a study before however in
that case the surfaces were planar so I generated the file for the glazing
construction and applied it to a single surface. In this case though I have
non-planar surfaces with a different pattern on top of each one which makes
it a different case.

Also thank you for the link to the paper. I looked at it when you sent it
out first and I found it really useful. It is a really comprehensive
review. Thank you so much for sharing.

Have a great weekend!

Best,
Mostapha

this is a great paper you have put together. Picking the proper
materials for fancy glazing and translucent shading has alway been a
bit of a black art. Your comparison shows very clearly what the
different materials can and cannot do. I was particularly struck by
the fact that BSDF is currently not particularly well suited for
modelling the view out that one gets with  translucent materials for
which trans is not quite good enough. I have not done much work with
BSDFs, but always lived under the impression that a measured BSDF is
the ultimate in accuracy for both light transmission (daylighting) and
view out (shading).

Thanks for making this paper available

Cheers

Axel

Message-ID: <CAN1QwsOVqh=zosnTw=AguaSc5zT072BUkje2ysStAD=fQtHo6w@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list,

I am trying to use the three phase method to evaluate a dynamic shading
device.

I have already created the vmx, xml, dmx, and skv.  Then I try to use
dctimestep to create the final render, but it does not return any image. I
typed:

pcomb '!dctimestep images/vmx/windowglow_W_%03d.hdr
xml/low-e+venetain80.xml results/windows.dmx skies/6_21_14.skv'
'!dctimestep images/vmx/windowglow_C_%03d.hdr xml/low-e+clear-lc.xml
results/clerestories.dmx skies/6_21_14.skv' >
images/6_21_14_Milwaukee_V80-clearLC.hdr

The only thing it returns is a bunch of signs like this:

???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????&????????????????????????????????????????~?????????????z???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????|??y}yyz???~????|???v????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????&?????.......

Does anyone know what might be wrong?

Thank you,

Message-ID: <FC1512A899372346A226C7E7EF70F5F925D277@GL-EXC-01.iesve.com>

I have an application which currently uses rtrace to generate illuminance data for sensors, and I'm trying to change this to use rcontrib.

When I have sensors on the WP pointing up (see simple model http://upload.iesve.com/downloads/rcontrib/model.png) I get results that I'm happy with (results for rtrace - http://upload.iesve.com/downloads/rcontrib/sensor1_rtraceCIE.png and results for rcontrib - http://upload.iesve.com/downloads/rcontrib/sensor1_rcontribCIE.png).

When I move the sensors to the ceiling and pointing down (see revised model http://upload.iesve.com/downloads/rcontrib/model2.png) I get no results for rcontib (results for rtrace - http://upload.iesve.com/downloads/rcontrib/sensor1D_rtraceCIE.png and results for rcontrib - http://upload.iesve.com/downloads/rcontrib/sensor1D_rcontribCIE.png).

I've attached the data files (http://upload.iesve.com/downloads/rcontrib/files.zip) - the file rcontrib.bat is what I'm running.

Hi Don,
Two things:
1 - You should use the same material for the sky and ground so that the
ground reflected component is included in patch 0. I typically use a single
360 degree source to encompass by sky and ground.
2 - Your zip file didn't include test_Model1.opt, used by the rcontrib
command, but make sure that -ab is 2 or greater to
get inter-reflected contribution from the sky on a ceiling illuminance
sensor (if -ab isn't sepcified in the opt file rcontrib defaults to -ab 1).

Let me know if these two changes don't give better results and I'll
investigate further.

Andy

	Fenestration with Radiance
Message-ID: <CAN1QwsMJuneADe-YO2tt50gsKBRUsmzBO_05A6B=pmdMSdDHVA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list,

I am trying to use the three phase method to calculate dynamic daylight
performance metrics for a dynamic shading device. Similar to the example 2
in the three phase method tutorial, I have two sets of windows
(clerestories and windows). I want to first calculate the annual
illuminance levels on a 6 by 8 grid. Then filter the data by occupancy
(normal working hours) and calculate the dynamic daylight metrics.

Since is the shading device in my model is dynamic and has to change based
on the incident light, I have two BSDF files for each window (e.g.
tinted.xml and untinted.xml).

I have created the vmx, dmx, xml, and smx files. But I am confused on how
to write the dctimestep and the rest of the calculations. Bellow is what I
have typed so far.  I'd truly appreciate it if you could help me from this
point on.

Thank you,

Leyla Sanati

If I understand your question correctly, I guess I would do the rest on a
spreadsheet or on a script.

For a spreadsheet, I would do:

rlam 'Results of venetian blind' 'Results of tinted' 'results of untinted'
> Results.txt

rlam '!dctimestep -n 8760 results/photocells_windowglow_W.vmx
xml/venetain80.xml results/windows.dmx Milwaukee.smx' '!dctimestep -n 8760
results/photocells_windowglow_C.vmx xml/tinted.xml results/clerestories.dmx
Milwaukee.smx' '!dctimestep -n 8760 results/photocells_windowglow_C.vmx
xml/untinted.xml results/clerestories.dmx Milwaukee.smx' >
results/Results.txt

And, you should get, for each timestep, the parameter you are using for
controlling the tint on your clerestories, and add that as an extra column.

Then, on excel it is possible to do:

|             A             |            B           |              C
     |                D            |          E           |
|  Venetian Results  |  Tinted Results  |  Untinted Results  |  Control
Parameter  |  Final Results  |

and put a formula to final result saying that, if(Control > theshold;
Venetian+Tinted;Venetian+Untinted).

Hope it helps... I am working on something to do this kind of things on a
single program, but it is not ready yet.

Regards,

German

I completely agree with Andy. Put this in your white_sky.sky:
void glow sky_glow
0
0
4  1 1 1  0

sky_glow source sky
0
0
4  0 0 1  360

@Andy
The file names are all messed up by Windows. It's test_Model2.opt that 
you're looking for. -ab is actually set to 5.

@Don,
you're overwriting rcontrib's default for -lr:
$ rcontrib -defaults
...
-lr -10     # limit reflection (Russian roulette)
...

Your setting it to -lr 8
Note the difference between positive and negative integers. I have to 
admit that this is one of the more obscure options that I don't tend to 
temper with. See man rpict. I ran your model with the -lr 8 removed from 
the opt file. Completely different outcome.

Also, your -ad is not very high. Unless you nudge it up a lot, there is 
no point in using 4 Reinhart subdivisions of the Tregenza patches. An 
-ad of 4096 is decent for a normal rtrace daylight simulation. For 
rcontrib, it should be much higher.

I don't know how you post-process the irradiance vector, since this 
script(?) is not included in the Zip file. However, you're calling 
rcontrib with the -V+ option. This gives you the *absolute* contribution 
from the sky patches, ie the irradiance at the sensor points.

One tends to use -V- here to get the daylight coefficients, ie the 
*relative* contribution from the sky patches. Once they have been 
calculated, the DC are multiplied with the sky vector to get actual 
irradiance values.

Regards

Axel

rcontrib.bat says '@TEST_M~1.OPT'  and this references 'test_Model2.opt' ?

German,

Thank you for your response.
I actually tried exporting the results to excel. However, the huge text
file needs some time consuming editing before the export.
I wonder if we could modify the scripts to pipe each sensor point data into
a separate file with one set of R G B values in each line.
This will save me a lot of time.

Thank you,
Leyla

Hi Andy,

> rcontrib.bat says '@TEST_M~1.OPT'  and this references 'test_Model2.opt' ?
>   The caps and ~ aside, I don't know how a 1 becomes a 2.  Windows never
> ceases to amaze me...

I think in Windows DOS-shell speak, TEST_M~1.OPT means something like

"the first file in this directory that starts with 'TEST_M' and has a 
base name (ie excl 3-letter extension) that is longer than 8 chars."

Since there is no 'test_Model1.opt' in this directory, 'test_Model2.opt' 
gets the '~1' treatment. Weird, I agree.

UPPER/lower case is pretty arbitrary under Windows, although you can't 
create 'test.txt' if 'Test.TXT' or 'TEST.txt' already exist.

What do you make of the -lr option? This is a little too obscure for me...

Cheers

Axel

You might consider using awk for postprocessing.  It's quite capable of
doing this sort of calculation.

Thanks for the explanation.  I thought the ~ was like a * character on
unix, but it is subtly different.

I don't see how the -lr being positive instead of negative could cause all
the results to be zero, but there is probably a connection that eludes me.

The latest version of dctimestep allows an output specification such as "-o sensor%02d.txt" to separate sensor files like you want.

Hi Greg,

I added the "-o sensor%02d.txt" option to the dctimestep line, and it
worked. But it created 8760 files for each time step rather than separating
the sensors. Here is what I typed:

dctimestep -n 8760 -o results/Venetain80/sensor%02d.txt
results/photocells_windowglow_W.vmx xml/venetain80.xml results/windows.dmx
Milwaukee.smx

Oh, oops!  Guess that is the way it works, not the other way around.  If you output into a single file as you were doing, the first 8760*3 values are the first sensor, the next 8760*3 are the next sensor, and so on.  A simple sed script should work for separating them, and you can automate generating the sed script using rcalc.  If you have 20 sensor, you would use:

% cnt 20 | rcalc -e 'a=8761*$1+2;b=8761*($1+1)' -o '${a},${b}w sensor${recno}.txt' > sedscr.txt
% [dctimestep command] | tr \\t \\n | sed -n -f sedscr.txt

For more or fewer sensors, just change the '20' in the first line.  I haven't tried this, but it should work -- assuming you have tr and sed, that is...

	simulation (rcontrib)
Message-ID: <CAOQvQd=5xrnacZTbugAT4gh-kPHb73ras=gf2XUBseSqdiCsqQ@mail.gmail.com>

hallo everyone,

I would like to ask you a favor: if anyone is able to send me a sample
project or simple room with trans material, with results, which i can
simulate in my computer. I am trying to simulate a project with dynamic
daylight simulation (dds / rcontrib)  but i am not able to say if the
results are correct or not.

in other word, i need a reference so to check if the results (according to
my settings) i am getting are fine or not.

thx in advance,

Hi Greg, Leyla,

> % [dctimestep command] | tr \\t \\n | sed -n -f sedscr.txt

I've just tried this out. The rcalc bit only works when a,b are up to
six digits long, which is 114 sensor points. rcalc goes into
exponential notation beyond this.
If you have more than 114 sensors, use this awk replacement instead:

cnt 115 | awk '{a=8761*$1+2; b=8761*($1+1); print a","b"w
sensor"NR".txt"}' > sedscr.txt

Andy, Axel,

Thanks for your replies - very helpful.

I've taken the "-lr 8" parameter out, changed the "-V+" to "-V-" and modified the "white_sky.sky" file.
I'm now getting results.

I'm using the following (shown for 15th June at 11:00am) to get the data -

gensky 6 15 11.00  -c -a 51.48 -o  0.45 -m  0.00 | genskyvec.exe -m 4 > day.dat
dctimestep.exe sky.dat day.dat > output.dat

Hi Axel,

Thanks for the testing & the fix!  I didn't think of the scientific notation issue....

I'm also embarrassed to admit that I never really learned how to use awk.

Cheers,
-Greg

>> Oh, oops!  Guess that is the way it works, not the other way around.  If you output into a single file as you were doing, the first 8760*3 values are the first sensor, the next 8760*3 are the next sensor, and so on.  A simple sed script should work for separating them, and you can automate generating the sed script using rcalc.  If you have 20 sensor, you would use:

I don't have a sample project you can run, but I can offer some advice:

A standard daylight coefficient run with a trans material (or BSDF) is
finicky because the the sky is sampled stochastically without regard to the
position of the sun.  If your sampling density is low or you use a high
resolution sky descretization scheme you might not fully sample the sky,
missing patches.  If the sun happens to be in a missed patch your result
will under estimate the illuminance.

I'd recommend using high -ad parameter, low -lw parameter and use the
tregenza sky (not reinhart).  Or better yet, use the 3-phase method.

I'd recommend running a few static sky conditions with rtrace to compare
with your DDS results.

Along the same lines, you can increase the -ss setting to 32 or 64 to get better specular sampling with trans and BSDF types.

I have less than 114 sensors right now, so I used Greg's script, and it
worked perfectly.
Thank you Axel for the info. I will keep your instructions in mind for
future simulations.

Thank you all  for your help.

Yo:

We are less than one month away from the annual Radiance Workshop, and I for one am excited! Jennifer Scheib and I will be your warm and convivial hosts here at NREL, and we are planning the agenda now. For those of you who have been under a rock, here are the details once again: http://www.nrel.gov/buildings/2013_radiance_workshop.html

With the free registration this year, I must admit the registration process has been pretty informal. As a result, I feel the need to confirm the guest list. I apologize for having to do this publicly, but I don't really see any other way to ensure that everyone who is planning to attend is on our guest list (which we need to clear with security). Sooooo, please take a sec to look at the following list. If you don't see your name, and are planning on attending the workshop *in person*, please send me an email immediately.(!)

Otherwise, we'll see you in a few weeks. Please don't hesitate to let me (rob.guglielmetti at nrel.gov) or Jennifer Scheib (Jennifer.scheib at nrel.gov) know if you have any questions regarding travel or whatever, and by all means if you've decided last-minute to attend, let us know, as it's not too late (but that train is leaving the station)! 

We are planning the presentation agenda now and will post it -- along with the webcast access info -- as soon as that's been fleshed out. And don't forget, there will also be tours of NREL's campus buildings, software demos, a trip to Boulder, and possibly a feats of strength competition as well. Stay tuned! 

OK, here comes the list. Get back to us if you need to!

Hey,

Do we know who is presenting? I am probably not going to be able to stay
the second day of the conference (I'll be there the 12th and 13th), so
could you schedule me for the 13th to present?

Alstan told me that he received a free admission to the last Radiance
conference when he gave a pre-workshop session. Since the workshop is free
this year, will the 4/5 of us presenting on the 12th get any compensation,
like the dinner?

Thanks,
Kera

Subject: [Radiance-general] genklemsamp.pl error on Windows
Message-ID: <CAAd_PgSd38NsDh6tEjkwfkPMprs9mb325X2=+JAKnRCDTLctng@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm trying to run the 3 phase method to on Windows and there are some
problems with running genklemsamp.pl. Not to say that I'm using Andy's
tutorial as the reference.


If I run genklemsamp by defining window properties it works fine:

>> genklemsamp -vp 50 0 25 -vh 80 -vv 40 -vd 0 -1 0 > samplerays_1.dat


However it crashes if I pass a window geometry file:

>> genklemsamp.pl -vd 0 -1 0 window.rad

Use of uninitialized value $tmploc in scalar chomp at C:\Radiance\bin\
genklemsamp.pl line 71.
Use of uninitialized value $tmploc in concatenation (.) or string at
C:\Radiance\bin\genklemsamp.pl line 72.
Can't spawn "cmd.exe": No such file or directory at C:\Radiance\bin\
genklemsamp.pl line 102.
Use of uninitialized value in split at C:\Radiance\bin\genklemsamp.pl line
110.
Use of uninitialized value $bcube[3] in multiplication (*) at
C:\Radiance\bin\genklemsamp.pl line 111.
Use of uninitialized value $bcube[3] in division (/) at C:\Radiance\bin\
genklemsamp.pl line 113.
Use of uninitialized value in addition (+) at
C:\Radiance\bin\genklemsamp.plline 113.
Use of uninitialized value $bcube[3] in division (/) at C:\Radiance\bin\
genklemsamp.pl line 113.
Use of uninitialized value in addition (+) at
C:\Radiance\bin\genklemsamp.plline 113.
Use of uninitialized value $bcube[3] in division (/) at C:\Radiance\bin\
genklemsamp.pl line 113.
Use of uninitialized value in addition (+) at
C:\Radiance\bin\genklemsamp.plline 113.
vwright: illegal horizontal view size
Illegal division by zero at C:\Radiance\bin\genklemsamp.pl line 118.

There is an issue with $tmploc on line 71 which is apparently only needed
for Windows systems. I tried to pass a different path to the variable as a
string but I couldn't solve the problem. Here is the lines 69-71.

if ($windoz) {
    my $tmploc = `echo \%TMP\%`;
    chomp($tmploc);
    ....

Anyone knows how can I get genklemsamp to work on Windows?

Thanks in advance,
Mostapha

Hi Mostapha

Try to replace

if ($windoz) {
    my $tmploc = `echo \%TMP\%`;
    chomp($tmploc);
    ...

with

if ($windoz) {
    if (exists $ENV{'TMP'}) {
        my $tmploc = $ENV{'TMP'};
    } else {
        my $tmploc = "C:\\Windows\\Temp";
    }
    chomp($tmploc);
    ...

Hi Thomas and Rob,

Thank you Thomas for the reply. Here is the result:

Global symbol "$tmploc" requires explicit package name at C:\Radiance\bin\
genklemsamp.pl line 75.
Global symbol "$tmploc" requires explicit package name at C:\Radiance\bin\
genklemsamp.pl line 76.
Execution of C:\Radiance\bin\genklemsamp.pl aborted due to compilation
errors.

I tried to solve the proble by adding "my $tmploc;" outside the block but
it then is giving me a similar error to what I had yesterday. I also tried
to change the location to c:\\temp to make sure it is not a permission
issue:

if ($windoz) {
    my $tmploc;
    if (exists $ENV{'TMP'}) {
        my $tmploc = $ENV{'TMP'};
    } else {
        my $tmploc = "C:\\Temp";
    }
    chomp($tmploc);
...

Here is the error again (line 76 is the last line in the code:
"chomp($tmploc);")

Use of uninitialized value $tmploc in scalar chomp at C:\Radiance\bin\
genklemsamp.pl line 76.

Message-ID: <CAFjajKg6Jkrw=4uSKzOfeefECqZu-0zWdD-KhQrU6RNVwbWf_w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everybody,

Can anyone tell me how to assign radiance materials to an object (i.e.
floor, ceiling, etc.) in Ecotect? I have my RAD material file in the
"material" folder of Ecotect, in "user preferences" I have given the
direction to this folder in the option of "material export directory" , and
I have my geometry modeled in Ecotect.

What should I do?
Best,

I found a tutorial (link below) that describes how to assign the custom Radiance materials.  See page 27 for how to apply the materials to the surfaces - it definitely helps if the surfaces(materials) are separated by zone.

Hope this helps!

So the problem with the code was $ENV{'TMP'} returns a HASH and Windows
couldn't create the temp folder. I assigned "c:\temp" as the temporary
folder so the code creates the temp folder however it cannot execute the
xform command later.

system "xform -m void @ARGV | oconv - > $td/surf.oct";

I tested it on Windows7 and Windows8 and I assume it is a permission issue
since if I type the same command in the command line, it just works fine
and creates surf.oct in the folder (attached!).

I think if I can find a way to run the commands in an elevated mode from
the Perl script, and modify all (system "do something") lines, then the
script should work just fine in Windows.

Mostapha,

could you try out this version of genklemsamp, please:
http://www.jaloxa.eu/pickup/genklemsamp-aj01.pl

I've made some small changes to the tempdir code.

Hi Axel,

Thanks for  your help.

It does change the folder to Windows temp folder:
C:\Users\%usename%\AppData\Local\Temp\(randomName) in my case, but it
doesn't create it.

I added one line to create the folder so it does it now but the problem
with executing Xform is still there (system "xform -m void @ARGV | oconv -
> $td/surf.oct";)

Again, if I write the same command in the command line it works fine.

Best regards,
Mostapha

Subject: [Radiance-general] gensky sky type
Message-ID: <CABzgtwpoZtkJD1AbN9Hn=9xvWj8QnQXZ_OHVYqyDmqwOuSHBxg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am using gendaylit with input from weather file. During sunrise and
sunset, gendaylit shows "ERROR: Model parameters out of range".   so I plan
to use gensky to generate the sky model (-B b -R r), where b and r are
calculated by "illumiance/179". However,  I found the illuminance value at
5 pm (calculated using gensky with default sky type) jumps a lot from illum
at 4 pm (calculated using gendaylit). I changed the sky type to +i, which
decreases values.  My question is that how I should choose the sky type for
gensky to avoid big change from gendaylit?

Thanks

JH

Dear JH,

at the moment, every feedback for errors of gendaylit is especially 
appreciated. 
We are currently adding some new features to gendaylit especially to avoid 
errors for surise/sunset. All new features of gendaylit will be presented 
also during the radiance workshop and we hope to have the new release 2.2 
ready before the RADIANCE workshop takes place. 
However, the error you have mentioned might be a different one. We are 
just working on some bugs of the -L option. Are you using this option? 
Please specify the precise command that leads to the error, including the 
precise error message and your version of gendaylit (just type gendaylit 
in your terminal). 

Wendelin

Dear Wendelin,

I find that the weather data is -L 0 0, which causes the error message. It
is a false alarm. I may simply ignore this error message. I am using
gendaylit 2.0 downloaded from your website. Glad to know there is a new
release!

gendaylit 1 1 8 -a 25 -o 75 -m 75 -L 0 0

Thanks,
