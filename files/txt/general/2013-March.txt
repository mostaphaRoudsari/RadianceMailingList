Dear list,

Once again I'm stuck scratching my head over pcomb functional syntax.  

I'd like to be able to modify an HDR image such that any pixel of a specific brightness li(n)  is changed to a specific color of a given value and the original pixel values are maintained for all the other pixels below the brightness threshold.



As always thanks,
Chris

Hi Chris,

Easy enough:

	pcomb -e 'Rs:.353;Gs:.915;Bs:.081' -e 'Lt:1000/WE' -e 'over=li(1)-Lt' \
		-e 'ro=if(over,Rs,ri(1));go=if(over,Gs,gi(1));bo=if(over,Bs,bi(1))'  -o input.hdr > output.hdr

I've arbitrarily set your special color to RGB=(.353,.915,.081) and the threshold to 1000 cd/m^2.

Cheers,
-Greg

Message-ID: <912E8E33E0563B448D0CB0FAA4E874D1708764F5C8@AMXEXC02.global.arup.com>

Pretty excited about the new 'gendaymtx' binary over here!

Hit a bit of a stumbling block on my first trial run, however.
When I feed it an 8760 hour weather tape, it produces a file that is 3 columns wide (R G B radiance) x 1279105 rows (which seems to correlate to 8760 x 146 sky patches...almost?).  Instead of adding 3 columns for each time step, it appears to be appending each time step to the end of the file.  This creates a problem when I try to run dctimestep, which gives me a "system- header read error".

My commands are something like this:

epw2wea tacoma.epw  tacoma.wea
rtcontrib -h- -faa -V+ -b tbin -bn 146 -m skyglow -f tregenza.cal < test.pts ${options} test.oct > daylightcoeffs.dc
gendaymtx -m 1 -r -90 weather/tacoma.wea > weather/tacoma.smx
| dctimestep -n 8760 daylightcoeffs.dc weather/tacoma.smx > test_illuminance.dat

Thanks for any insight on this nifty new tool.

Hi Galen,

Thanks for trying this out.  I assume the '|' symbol in your e-mail is just a stray character, otherwise you would get an error trying to execute this.

I hadn't tested this mode before with a simple daylight coefficient matrix, but it seems to work OK.  Are you sure your "daylightcoeffs.dc" file has an appropriate header to it?  The dctimestep command expects the file to start something like:

#?RADIANCE
Test matrix
FORMAT=ascii

0.954473516	0.443845774	0.2058499
0.64873052	0.152509289	0.862083965
...

Binary files will have "FORMAT=float" or suchlike, instead.  On the other hand, the sky vector or matrix file is not expected to have a header.  A bit peculiar, I know, but this is how things worked out.  Your gendaymtx has the appropriate number of lines, 876*146 plus 146 blank lines separating each sky patch row.

Cheers,
-Greg

Thanks Greg,

Indeed, my daylight coefficient file was missing the header (my rtcontrib line still had a '-h-' in it from the script I copied it from).

It runs smoothly (and quickly!) now.

Thanks,
Galen

i finished the?example?1. now i am tying to the?example 2.

but i have the new error with the following command.

Hi Ogata,

I don't see anything visibly wrong with your command line.  Core dumps in general should not happen, but can if the command line arguments are badly wrong since some programs don't check argument counts carefully.  I think the new rcontrib does, but I don't know for sure about rtcontrib.  In any case, I don't see anything obvious here.  What happens when you type "rtcontrib -version" by itself on the command line?  What happens if you type "rcontrib -version?"

-Greg

I might say the obvious, but I had that problem some time ago (if I
remember well), and it was a problem with Radiance installation. Does it
say "Done" when you finish that?

As a theoretical exercise I am trying to generate a Radiance image (via
Ecotect) of daylight bouncing off a light shelf in a room (30'w x 10.5'h x
60' deep) where the light shelf (top surface), ceiling and the floor are
mirror surfaces (100% reflective and 100% specular) while the walls are non
reflecting black.  I have been unsuccessful, so far, to generate  more than
two reflections.  I would appreciate any help in generating the 3rd, 4th
and subsequent reflections.  I would be happy to send images to anyone
interested.

Are you using the default parameters for rpict/rtrace? Have you tried setting the -dr parameter greater than 2? If you post the command you are using to calculate the reflections, it may be easier to comment. I suspect it will be more complicated than the -dr setting, but that's a start.

I am using Radiance via Ecotect.  I have played around with changing the

Subject: [Radiance-general] Reinhart.cal - show sky patches problem.
Message-ID: <CAF-iH4J5+vRsxhkwj=aVNynJQwbzF7mAfM-esC6=jjqCN0t_nw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list,

I was following the Axel Jacobs' rt-contrib lesson; trying to learn a
little bit more about DC and that kind of things. Anyway, I was trying to
show the sky divisions, s I can see the differente between Tregenza, and
Reinhart's MF1 2 3 and 4. So I did this:
*
*
*vsk="-x $DIMS -y $DIMS -vf views/sky.vf"*
*rm -f images/patches/**
*vwrays -ff $vsk |rcontrib -n 4 @image.opt -ffc $(vwrays -d $vsk) -V+ -e
MF:4 -f reinhart.cal -b rbin -bn Nrbins -o images/patches/p%04d.hdr -m
sky_glow \ testroom_whitesky.oct*
*
*
It works very well for tregenza and MF1; but for the rest of them (MF2 and
greater), the image corresponding to patch 244 fails, with no output at all.

Any suggestions?

THANKS VERY MUCH

I am hoping to see multiple reflections of the light beam reflected off the
light shelf top surface in both the floor and the ceiling (all of which are
mirror surfaces).

If all these surfaces are mirrors, then you cannot see anything.... unless:
- there is a non-mirror reflecting object somewhere in your scene that is supoposed to be lit by the multiple-reflecting light path; since it will reflect light in many directions you should see it!
or
- your point of view is located somewhere on the multiple-reflecting light path and your view direction points towards it. Then you should directly see the light source appearing as an image on the last mirror.

Message-ID: <CAFVgASXeU4MQ6uSteN1zcfLdjTJ6OputgrqcNeG_odu4vSP9rg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I've been asked to model windows that have a film with 50% haze and
91% transmission.

I do not have a BSDF for the material. The best option I can think of
is to use the trans material with 91% transmission and hope that it
provides about 50% haze. Does anyone have experience modeling film
based on haze? If so, any pointers? A tutorial I should look at?

Thanks,
Tim Perry

German,

Most shells have a limit on the number of files that can be open
simultaneously.
You can find out what the current limit is by typing:
ulimit -n

(default is 256 for mac)

you can raise the limit to 2400 by typing
ulimit -n 2400

Hope this works,
Andy

Hi Tim,

Haze is the percentage of transmitted light which deviates from the
incident direction.  So you could interpret the haze to mean that 50% of
the transmitted light is diffused.

As a first approximation I would use trans with the following transmission
properties:
Ts = 0.455
Td = 0.455

Though with a haze of 50% assuming that the scattered light is lambertian
is a bit of a stretch.

ASTM standard D1003 defines the method for measurement of "haze." According to this document, haze is defined as T-diffuse / T-total
http://www.hunterlab.com/appnotes/an05_97.pdf
That could help in guessing at a trans definition, but accuracy would be unknown.

Dear list,

I was trying gendaymtx and the new dctimestep (it works excelent, thanks to
the developers), and noticed the following.

I modeled a big cube, and set sensors pointing north, south, east and west
(the idea is that the cubes shades). Then, I made a DC matrix, created the
sky matrix; and dctimesteped all together (the weather used is Montreal),
and got THESE <https://sites.google.com/site/sunliteproject/comments>
 results.

The sensors were defined (North, South, East and West, respectively)

0 3.1 1 0 1 0
0 -3.1 1 0 -1 0
3.1 0 1 1 0 0
-3.1 0 1 -1 0 0

Anyway; North and South seem to be ok to me (simetric along the day, and
the south has more "sun" than north). But West and East seem to be
inverted...? and the east is more insolated in the afternoon? (I havent
really looked at the numbers themselves, but just to the tendency). *Can
there be a bug in the program??*

On the other hand... is there any plan on adding the -O option to
gendaymtx, to get the solar intensities?

THANKS TO EVERYONE IN ADVANCE

Dear list,

My bad, the convention is as I thought; and everything seem to work
correctly.

Still wondering about the -O option though.

THANKS ANYWAY TO ALL

Hi Germ?n,

I am not quite sure how the new gendaylit -O option, which changes the incorporated spectrum, is supposed to interact with RGB colors in a Radiance scene.  You would have to redefine your materials to incorporate a different set of wavelengths and define what those are to really be consistent about it.  Doing everything in single-channel mode introduces another type of inaccuracy, one that is potentially greater than the difference between total flux and visible flux.  You really have to know what you're doing.

-Greg

Dear Greg,

I think I will elaborate what I am trying to do first using the "gendaylit
| genskyvec", and see if it works, then I may ask these kind of things.

My idea was, indeed, to emulate a single-channel mode, as I did when I used
genBSDF for solar transmission. Of course, the materials wil have to be
adapted: I was planning to use spectrally averaged solar properties (grey
world), and I have no intention of obtaining lighting information out of
these calculatons.

As you might guess, I am not quite sure I know what I am doing, haha, but
my understanding is that it should work, right? My idea is to validate all
these, though.

THANKS

German

hi Shamim
do you assign the mirror surfaces as secondary light source? if you use
ecotect for modelling, in the material assignment of this software, in the
advanced export you should write this discription :
void mirror materail name
0
0
3  1 1 1
does it solve the problem?

We're gonna need a little more info than that, again with the caveat that Desktop Radiance hasn't been officially supported in ages.

With that said, what exactly are you doing that produces the error message?

What is in that folder ?  Is there a .bat file ?  Has desktop radiance created /mat /lib /dat folders and also xxxxxx.rad files ?

With that said, what exactly are you doing that produces the error message?

I believe this is what I have already done.  I have tried to document my
efforts in the following shared folder in dropbox:
https://www.dropbox.com/home/SJ_Light%20Shelf%20Reflection%20Files_12mar

The folder has my ecotect file, Radiance files and few pages of PDF trying
to clarify my question.  Any help will be much appreciated!

Shamim,

Your ceiling surface normal is facing up (which matters for the mirror
type).  Change polygon zone91.rad00770 to what is copied below.

Also make sure that you set -dr and -lr parameters to the number of mirror
reflections you want to have (8 or so?).

Let me know if you still don't see what you are expecting.

Best,
Andy

That was an aspect I had not thought about.  Thanks for the tip!  I went
back and fixed the surface normal's in my model.  It did not, however,
create the reflections I am looking for.

Are you expecting to see them in your rendering?  This will not be the case
in the way that you set up your model.  The light will not be visible on a
perfect mirror because all light is reflected in the mirror direction -
none to the view point.  And all your walls are perfectly absorbing so you
won't see any light patterns on those either.  Your view will only show
reflection of the perfectly black walls.  The multiple reflections should
show up in your illuminance calcs though.

I suggest changing the walls to gray and changing the time of day to 11:45.
 Then you should see reflection patterns along the west wall of your model.

Andy

I tried the suggestions but could not get to the anticipated outcome.  See

Any other thoughts most welcome!

My result is much different.  With gray walls, perfect mirror floor and
ceiling and using a time of 11.75 for the sky my rendering looks like this:
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/16523492/test.tif
(cool infinity box effect!)

Here is the model that I use (which is just your model modified as I had
suggested):
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/16523492/Test.zip

And these are the commands I use:
oconv mirror_s.rad mirror_s_sky.rad > test.oct

rvu -vth -vp 9.628 4.564 6.510 -vd -1.701 0.360 -0.007 -vu 0 0 1 -vh 180
-vv 180 -vs 0 -vl 0 -dr 20 -lr 20 -ps 1 -ab 3 test.oct

maybe you can spot the difference between what I'm doing and what you're
doing?

Andy

That is wonderful!  Yes, I will look into the difference between mine and
yours.  I am also planning to make a physical model today to test it out in
real daylight.  More soon...

Dear Chris, Andy,

Thank you for the reference and the feedback. I think I'll use Andy's
definition even though the distribution of light is definitely not
lambertian. It should provides sufficiently accurate results for the
task at hand.

I think I'll ask the client if they have a BSDF first though.

Thanks again,
Tim

Message-ID: <CADoMKs0cxWiPJDc_bHGKovPNK8W7TBiqeZ5tdQLB1z6LBp-CnA@mail.gmail.com>

Folks,

I am stumped. There is a halo around a black box on a grey background
in a rendering, and I can't figure out how to get rid of it (because I
can't imagine that it's real).

I am preparing renderings for an art submission, and I am simulating a
little model mountain inside a small flat black frame on a light grey
wall, in a room with an array of ceiling lights and one spot. Here is
what happens (rpict and mountain-removed rvu):

http://markjstock.org/transfer/whyTheHaloMaster.png
http://markjstock.org/transfer/whyTheHalo.png

The black material is plastic with 0.0 specularity.
The halo is independent of the ambient parameters.
The halo is independent of -lw refinement.
The halo is still there if the black box touches the wall or is offset a little.
The halo doesn't go away when I render at high resolution.

Can anyone tell me what is going on here? Unzip and run "make" on:
http://markjstock.org/transfer/whatGives.zip

Hi Mark,

I tried to run your example but I failed. Some files seem to be missing. 
What about increasing the roughness of your black frame?

Kai,

Thanks for checking. Which files were missing?

Changed black frame to "0.03 0.03 0.03 0.0 0.2" and no change.

Hi?

I wanted to make ambient occlusion map of the scene.....
what i did is

1. Perfectly black plastic material for avoid interreflection
2. define glow color to surface.
3. and a surface light source ?pointing straight up?
4. used rpict with -i for irradiance map and set set ambient bounce to 0;

e.g.

void plastic meshmaterial
?0
?0
?5 0.0 0.0 0.0 0 0

void glow irrad
0
0
4 ?0.4 ? 0.4 ?0 .4 ? 0

irrad source irradsphere
0
0
4 0 0 1 180.0

# Mesh details ......all are using meshmaterial


when i render then rendered image does not show any scene (i.e. black scene image) ??
What i am missing ?conceptually ??

My camera position is correct as i get other maps such as depth or normal map correct.


Best Regards,     Brajesh Lal

Jack,

Sorry. Reducing -dc -dt and -ds doesn't seem to do anything.

I learned this morning that the halo is coming from the array of ceiling 
lights and not the spotlight.

I also discovered that the halo gets smaller as the black box is moved 
away from the wall.

And the antimatter cutout that turns the box into a frame doesn't affect 
the halo.

Hi Mark,

Yeah, poking around a bit I see the direct parameter don't seem to have 
much impact. On the other hand I found that if I set -ar to 256 then the 
halo disappears.

Jack,

Excellent! Thank you. I am surprised that -ar has any effect when sampling 
is turned off (-aa 0). I didn't even try to modify -ar because I didn't 
think it would do anything.

You will need at least one ambient bounce to calculate the contribution of an ambient "glow" source. Zero ambient bounces means only direct sources like "light" would be traced.

Also, I'm not sure, but the rpict manual says the -i option actually estimates the irradiance using the radiance value and the lambertian reflectance. I've never delved into the code, so I'm not sure how accurate that description is. After testing -ab 1, you might also try assigning a very small reflectance to your black surface.

Andy,

Pictures from my model:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/xz5glrx34o4cucz/LS%20Ref_Model%20Pic_14mar.pdf
They do validate your simulation results.

I tried to replicate your simulation image (using Radiance via Ecotect) but
without success so far.  I used the Radiance Control Panel in Ecotect
to insert the values you had used for your simulation but continue to get
my previous picture. How long did your image take to generate?

Shamim.

Hi Christopher

Actually i am computing per pixel visibility ( or say each point visibility of the surface) in the up direction. I suppose if we set ambiance bounce more than zero, then it will have inter-reflection effect. and to avoid interreflection contribution i have done surface material perfectly black and bounces zero.

Yes we do need light source, for that i am using glow ( self?luminous?surface ?) and a unity hemispherical light source for a point.

and logically i suppose -completely visible point is shaded as unity, and zero will be treated as occluded. so value of rgb determines the visibility factor.

-i option produces ?irradiance map.?


so basically i render the scene?
rpict ?-x resx, -y resy -i -ab 0 -vf camera.vp ?scene.oct > scene.hdr


Best Regards,     Brajesh Lal

Are you tracing the pixels from a view point looking at the black surface, to show the irradiance caused by the glow source, which is behind your view point contributing onto the black mesh surface? And the view point is a parallel projection?

That was pretty clear to me, in looking at the rendering. The multiple
edges evident particularly from the bottom of the frame are the giveaway.
You are using Radiance light objects, and these always give these
exceedingly (unbelievably) sharp edges to the pools of light that they
cast. Radiance lights based on a photometry file tend to have softer
edges, even those based on directional lamps.

Jack's trick worked because even tho you have -aa at zero, you have -ab 2
which will still cause the ambient calculation to be run; the increased
-ar has the effect of softening the halo, I think. -aa 0 simply turns off
interpolation, not the ambient calculation altogether.

I think.

My guess is that the issue is related to Ecotect.  Does ecotect export a
bat file that you can modify and run outside of ecotect?

I render the image from camera point of view as i captured the real world scene.?

and if i put any distant liht source e.g. sun - ? then i can see the scene. but ?can see the scene if we use object as light source... ?

?

That doesn't sit well with me. I do want the ambient calculation, but "-aa 
0" is supposed to turn caching off---or run a fresh new hemisphere 
sampling for every image pixel (assuming -ps 1). So why would it 
interpolate from some brighter ambient point in the dark area *under the 
frame* instead of probing outward for the incident light? Ambient 
resolution should have no part of that.

Brajesh,

This is expected behavior.  As Chris pointed out glow sources are sampled
using the ambient calculation.  This is because glow was intended to model
the sky, a very large area source.  It is much more efficient and accurate
to sample the sky using the stochastic ambient calculation compared of the
deterministic direct calculation.

With -ab 0 you get no light in your image from the glow (unless you can see
the glow geometry in your view).  Setting -ab 1 when using a glow source is
equivalent to a direct only calculation (ie without any
inter-eflection effects).

Thanks Andrew,

yes if i give -ab 1 is direct calculation only then it is working.....

Brajesh,

This is expected behavior. ?As Chris pointed out glow sources are sampled using the ambient calculation. ?This is because glow was intended to model the sky, a very large area source. ?It is much more efficient and accurate to sample the sky using the?stochastic?ambient calculation compared of the deterministic direct calculation.

With -ab 0 you get no light in your image from the glow (unless you can see the glow geometry in your view). ?Setting -ab 1 when using a glow source is equivalent to a direct only calculation (ie without any inter-eflection?effects).

Hi Mark,

I suspect you are seeing specular samples from low angles on your black frame.  If the frame has a roughness below 0.001 or so and non-zero specularity, the Fresnel coefficient will cause the specularity to go to nearly 1 as you approach grazing.  This is correct behavior, but in regions near the inside edge, this will cause stray, bright sample values in your ambient calculation.  The only way to fix it is to set roughness above 0.002 or set specularity to zero on your surface.

I haven't downloaded your model to confirm the material parameters, so I'm really just guessing.

Cheers,
-Greg

That was my first suspicion as well, but the halo remained even after 
dropping specularity to zero.

Computers have been doing extremely weird stuff for me these last few 
days. Is there a big solar flare or something?

Where did you get your copy of Radiance? Do you know what version it is?

If not, "getinfo foo.hdr" will identify the version of Radiance that 
generated foo.hdr.

I looked at the files generated by Radiance via Ecotect and it looks like
the version of Radiance it is using is 3.1.8.  Here is a copy of one of the

It looks like the changes you make to -dr and -lr are not being passed to
Radiance.
I recommend running radiance yourself from the dos prompt.  You many need
to install Radiance first (I'm not sure if ecotect's version of Radiance is
set up to be used from the command line).  Best bet is to use the NREL
installer (
https://openstudio.nrel.gov/getting-started-developer/getting-started-radiance
)

After you install Radiance, start the dos shell and change directory to the
location of the model files.  Then enter the following commands:

oconv mirror_scorrected_sky.rad mirror_scorrected.rad >
mirror_socorrected.oct
rpict -t 120 -vth -vp 9.628 4.564 6.510 -vd -1.701 0.360 -0.007 -vu 0 0 1
-vh 180 -vv 180  -lr 15 -dr 15  -i -ps 1 mirror_socorrected.oct >
mirror_socorrected.hdr
ra_tiff -z mirror_socorrected.hdr mirror_socorrected.tif

Looks like the -dr and -lr values (both 20, in your 1st attempt)
*are*being passed on to radiance via Ecotect without giving me the
desired
results.  See circled values in the image:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/q8wxn164lgf0oak/Radiance%20parameters_15mar.pdf

I am going to try the dos prompt suggestion next.

1998 is pretty old--it's possible we're giving you advice for newer versions.

NREL has a newer release of Radiance for Windows. I'm pretty sure you 
can hook it up with Ecotect, but I'm not sure exactly how.  Anyone done 
this?

As far as I can remember there are two changes that you should apply in the
.bat file generated by ECOTECT:

1. change -sj to -ss [in the rtrace line]
2. change rview to rvu

Shaim,
Can you try typing the commands I sent directly at the dos prompt?
That would tell us if it is a problem with the outdated version of Radiance
you are using or if it is a problem with the Ecotect Radiance Control
Panel.  I still think it is a problem with the latter as the commands
settings didn't get into the header created by Radiance.

I'd rather determine if Ecotect related software is the cause now, rather
than going further assuming that it is Radiance (which I doubt, but I am
biased).

Andy

one more thing  - can you double check that the ceiling surface normal is
still facing downward (and that you didn't re-export geometry from
ecotect).  It seems odd that there is one reflection of the the floor but
none off the ceiling (the light that gets to the floor comes straight
through the window and misses the light shelf).  There should be the same
number of reflections from both.

Dear Colleagues,

My sincere thanks to Andy and everyone else who have tried to help me in
the last few days with my light shelf reflection problem.  Finally I have
some results which are more convincing:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/bt46eywmsykphv4/mirror_graywall2.pdf

The directionality (surface normal) of the the ceiling mirror surface seem
to be one of the major things that was throwing me off.  My next step is to
import the values of these multiple reflections on to a simulation grid so
that I can plot them as a graph.

Your support meant much to me.
Shamim.

Andy,

How could you tell by just looking at the numbers that my ceiling surface
normal was facing up?

I am trying to import the results of the radiance simulation (with bands of
light hitting the floor) on to an analysis grid to finally generate an
illumination graph that would have progressive 'bumps' reflecting these
light bands.  https://www.dropbox.com/s/owvm7gqtamicdou/analysis%20grid.pdf
Any suggestions on an effective way of doing this would be much appreciated.

My radiance image has a distinct raddish tint unlike yours which came out
with much more natural colors.  Any thoughts how I may improve this?

The most direct way to derive the surface normal direction of a polygon is to simply look at the draw order of the polygon's vertices. Radiance polygons follow the "right hand rule", which means that a polygon that is planar to the x,y and drawn in a counter-clockwise fashion will have the surface normal running along the positive z axis.

thank you greg and german. i finished the example 1 and example 2.
i have new questions for the example 1. i made the figure 13, 18, 19, 20, 21. but results seem to be different than the manual. i have done as manual. what is wrong?

i attach a PDF file describing my results.

the diffarances between my results and the manual are as follows.
1. in figure 13, the order of the images seems to be different.
2. in figure 18, the illuminance in my results are bigger than the manual. also the venetian0 is bigger than the venetian45.
3. in figure 19-21, the distributitons of images are different with the manual. for example, in figure 21, the illuminance on the floor is bigger than other walls in our result. but in the manual, the value on the ceilling is bigger than other place.
4. etc


please help me! ?

I do not know if radiance supports 'analysis grid' or its equivalent but if
it did, can I suspend one in 'mid-air' (say one at 30" off the floor) and
expect to get illuminance values off it?  Can it be a two-sided grid
registering both the light coming off the ceiling and the floor?  The
referenced file may explain my question a bit more:

Shamim.

You can export the analysis from Ecotect (it becomes a list of xyz coordinates with normal direction vector of that sensor). You can then use rtrace to calculate your illuminance values. You will need to create two grid files, one with normal vectors pointing up (0 0 1) for light arriving from the ceiling and a grid with normals pointing down (0 0 -1) for light bouncing off the floor.

Using the "Final Render" option in the Radiance Analysis/Export panel of Ecotect allows you to assign a grid ("Generate Point Data" check box). If you are using radiance from the command line rather than the Ecotect interface, the best way I've found to save a grid file is to set the output to "Daysim header" and uncheck "Auto-run Daysim". The analysis grid will be in the specified folder, saved as a .pts file.

I suggest looking through this tutorial for step by step guidance. http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/research/gsdsquare/Publications/GettingStartedwithEcotectRadianceDaysim.pdf

Best of luck.

Subject: Re: [Radiance-general] RE : Light Shelf Reflections

I do not know if radiance supports 'analysis grid' or its equivalent but if it did, can I suspend one in 'mid-air' (say one at 30" off the floor) and expect to get illuminance values off it?  Can it be a two-sided grid registering both the light coming off the ceiling and the floor?  The referenced file may explain my question a bit more:

The most direct way to derive the surface normal direction of a polygon is to simply look at the draw order of the polygon's vertices. Radiance polygons follow the "right hand rule", which means that a polygon that is planar to the x,y and drawn in a counter-clockwise fashion will have the surface normal running along the positive z axis.

Andy,

How could you tell by just looking at the numbers that my ceiling surface normal was facing up?

I am trying to import the results of the radiance simulation (with bands of light hitting the floor) on to an analysis grid to finally generate an illumination graph that would have progressive 'bumps' reflecting these light bands.  https://www.dropbox.com/s/owvm7gqtamicdou/analysis%20grid.pdf
Any suggestions on an effective way of doing this would be much appreciated.

My radiance image has a distinct raddish tint unlike yours which came out with much more natural colors.  Any thoughts how I may improve this?

one more thing  - can you double check that the ceiling surface normal is still facing downward (and that you didn't re-export geometry from ecotect).  It seems odd that there is one reflection of the the floor but none off the ceiling (the light that gets to the floor comes straight through the window and misses the light shelf).  There should be the same number of reflections from both.

That would tell us if it is a problem with the outdated version of Radiance you are using or if it is a problem with the Ecotect Radiance Control Panel.  I still think it is a problem with the latter as the commands settings didn't get into the header created by Radiance.

I'd rather determine if Ecotect related software is the cause now, rather than going further assuming that it is Radiance (which I doubt, but I am biased).

Where did you get your copy of Radiance? Do you know what version it is?

If not, "getinfo foo.hdr" will identify the version of Radiance that generated foo.hdr.

Hi Shamim,
I think others have addressed most of your questions. So I'll just help you
with the appearance of your image.  There are two things to consider.

1)  Some of your "gray" materials are actually quite red.  From your
materials file:

void plastic Wall_gray
0
0
5 *0.867 0.384 0.122 *  0.00000 0.00000

void plastic Floor_Dark_Gray
0
0
5 *0.388 0.137 0.027*   0.00000 0.00000

The first three numbers following the 5 (on the fourth line) are the red,
green and blue reflectance value.  Both of these "gray" materials have
higher red reflectance so they are actually red.  To get rid of the red you
should balance the RGB reflectances.


2) you are creating an illuminance rendering instead of the typical
luminance rendering.  An illuminance rendering is a rendering of the
illuminance at each point in the model and is really only useful for
analysis.  A luminance rendering resembles what one would see in real life.
 This is why you don't get the infinity box effect that I had in my
rendering and that you get in your scale model.  But the illuminance
rendering is a handy way to understand the reflections on a mirror surface
without making your head spin.

To generate an illuminance rendering, the -i option is included in the
rpict command (your rpict currently uses the -i option).
To generate a luminance rendering remove the -i option.

Best,
Andy

Hi Ogata,

This tutorial was made in the early days of the 3-phase method.  There have
been many bug fixes, including one where angles were mis-interpreted twice,
so the result for symmetric CFS was okay.

1 - Fixing the bug mentioned above affects the numbering of the view matrix
renderings.  So your figure 13 is correct.

2 - in figure 18, the venetian0 and venetian 45 labeling is swapped.  The
result isn't affected.

3 - this is strange, especially with part of the window showing up black.

Did you make sure to change to the W6 Standard basis in window (Figure 14
in the tutorial)?


I'm working on updating the tutorial to fix these issues and to incorporate
newer capabilities.  Hopefully I have a new version this week.

Andy

Subject: [Radiance-general] illuminance on external facade
Message-ID: <514A38B1.3020801@gmail.com>

Folks,

This may not be a relevant question for Radiance list, but I ask it anyway.

If I have the solar incident (irradiance, direct and diffuse) on the 
external facade, is there a simple way to calculate/estimate the 
illuminance on the facade? The magic number 179?

Thanks,

Ery

Dear Ery,

the 179 is the magic number just for Radiance... is the Luminous Efficacy.
My understanding is that the Luminous Efficacy of the clear sky is around
100; but it vary.

My answer would be NO. But wait for others, there might be some hope yet.

Regards,

German

Message-ID: <CAF-iH4KCmgcY7-CRH1NENgk6OtKungBo84QZRc0hwO9Pz4-p9A@mail.gmail.com>

Dear List,

I still do not understand how to call the .cal files... I was trying to
calculate a View matrix using the following command:

*cat ./Workplanes/Floor.pts | rcontrib -n 1  -f klems_int.cal -b kbin(0, 1,
0, 0, 0, 1) -bn Nkbins -m window_1 -I+ V_model.oct > ./VMX/V-Room-1.vmx*
*
*
The problem is in the *kbin(0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1)* part, which I do not know
how to call (this is a window looking south).

I know I could call it like kbinS; but since I am exporting from SketchUp,
the normals and Ups may vary.

THANKS VERY MUCH

German,

I think you need to enclose the kbin in single quotes like this:
-b 'kbin(0,1,0,0,0,1)'

Ery,

German is correct.  179 lumens/watt is the efficacy for uniform
distribution of visible light.  And only useful after you've converted to
visible energy.

The efficacy for the solar spectrum varies based on properties of the
atmosphere (which is constantly changing).  The efficacy for direct sun is
generally 80-120 lumens/watt.  The efficacy for sky is typically 100-140
lm/watt.  The efficacy of light on a facade is further complicated since it
is a constantly changing mix of direct and sky.

Sorry I can't give you an easy number!

Andy

Hi Ery,

it might be worth looking at the gendaylit source. There should be some models implemented for estimation of the luminous efficacy, and thus conversion between radiometric and photometric units. Still, it is certainly a good idea to measure irradiance instead of illuminance if this is what you need.

Cheers, Lars.

All,

Thanks for the comments.

A bit more background information. We are doing a coupled 
EnergyPlus-Radiance simulation on blinds control. The blinds control is 
in EnergyPlus, and we use Radiance to calculate the illuminance in the 
space.

One of the blinds control algorithm that we tested uses the vertical 
illuminance at the exterior facade. As you said, there is no easy way to 
calculate this in EnergyPlus. So we need to have another Radiance run 
just to calculate the vertical illuminance at the external facade. I am 
not happy with having to call Radiance twice, because it adds a bit of 
complexity and a bit of time to the whole scheme. So that is why I was 
wondering about simple calculation of vertical illuminance if we know 
the total solar irradiance on the surface.

So I dig further. The file below contains some graphs with simple 
regression on irradiance and illuminance on external facade:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/mqs4vycp1vc01w7/vertical_illum_solar.zip


The irradiance is the total solar incidence (direct, diffuse plus ground 
reflection) calculated by EnergyPlus and the vertical illuminance is 
calculated by Radiance (gendaylit and rtrace). They both came from the 
same weather file (Boise TMY3 EPW).

Apart from anomalies on the some points on West and North facade, the 
slope is about 100-110 lm/W. I will dig deeper to look at some outliers 
in the data.

Any thoughts?

Ery

Hello,

I am doing rad Tutorial, there we used blue_band as a modifier for
wall_mat. I checked the primitive for blue_band and it looks like below:

void colorfunc blue_band
4 if(Pz-1.2,1,if(Pz-1,0,1)) if(Pz-1.2,1,if(Pz-1,0,1)) 1 .
0
0

my question is how can I find a description for second sentence?

Thanks,

Ehsan

Hi Ehsan,

That line uses the Radiance functional language, which is sorta documented in the filefmts.pdf file, located here:

Hi Ery,

Tinkering with the Boise TMY3 data I was a little surprised to see how some of the efficacy values turned out.  For those unfamiliar, the Boise TMY3 climate file (much like many of the others from the Energy+ website) contains both illuminance and irradiance data for these quantities:

- Global horizontal (Gh)
- Diffuse horizontal (Dh)
- Direct normal (Dn)

Sometimes illuminance data is derived from irradiance measurements, though nowadays it is more likely to be measured separately.  Which it is could be identified in the climate file (I haven't checked).

The following table shows how the mean luminous efficacy (within 5klux bands of global horizontal illuminance) varies for: the global horizontal; the diffuse horizontal; and, the direct normal quantities:

	gh_lo           gh_hi	     Eff_gh          Eff_dh          Eff_dn

The global efficacy value (Eff_gh), as you noted, is between 100 and 100 lm/W -- I'd expect global vertical to be very similar to global horizontal, at least for sun illuminated orientations.  Direct normal efficacy across the ranges is also pretty much how I expected it to vary.  However, diffuse horizontal efficacy seems to flap-around quite a bit -- four maxima, two of them quite conspicuous.  I wouldn't have been too surprised to see general trends, but this was unexpected.  Can't say that I've noticed or given much thought to it before, but I am a little intrigued by those high values, i.e. > 200 lm/W.

Hi Ehsan,

you are not the first one having problems starting with the cal-file 
syntax. So let me try.
> I am doing rad Tutorial, there we used blue_band as a modifier for 
> wall_mat. I checked the primitive for blue_band and it looks like below:
>
> void colorfunc blue_band
> 4 if(Pz-1.2,1,if(Pz-1,0,1)) if(Pz-1.2,1,if(Pz-1,0,1)) 1 .

> 0

"if (a,b,c)" in Radiance is a function returning "b" if a>0 and "c" if a<=0.

The minimal colorfunc line expects values for R, G, B and a cal-file. In 
the given case, the values for R and G are calculated by the given 
formulae, the value for B is fixed to 1 and the cal-file is not needed 
and set to the current path "."

The expression "if(Pz-1.2,1,if(Pz-1,0,1))" is interpreted as:
if (Pz-1.2,.....) : as the if-function decides according to the 
condition >0 or not, this leads to the evaluation wether Pz is greater 
then 1.2. If this is the case, the return value (the value for the 
R-channel) is 1. If Pz <= 1.2, thus Pz-1.2 becoming 0 or less, the 
return value (R-channel) will be set to the result of the expression 
"if(Pz-1,0,1)". This follows the same rules, setting the return value 
(R-channel) to 0 if Pz is larger then 1, and to 1 if smaller or equal 1. 
If you combine these two expression, you will get R=1 if Pz=<1 or 
Pz>1.2, else R=0. As Pz is the z-coordinate of the point where you 
calculate the pixel color, this results in a line centered at height 1.1 
of 0.2 width.

Hope this helps to understand the remains of the line...

Cheers, Lars.

Hi John,

Thanks for looking at this. This is indeed interesting. When I get back in the office I can at least ask around if the measured versus derived illuminance question is answered somewhere in the weather file. As to the reason(s) why the efficacy for diffuse horizontal flaps around, I'm stumped, and unclear if its cause for alarm. Anyone?

Rob and others
The very high numbers (>300) are not physically plausible (at least on this
planet with its atmosphere and sun). You can get numbers in the 200l/w
range if you filter sunlight through spectrally selective glass.  If I had
to guess, without doing any homework, its an artifact of the derivation as
follows: I assume diffuse radiation is calculated by processing measured
global irradiance and measured or assumed beam, and that diffuse
illuminance is calculated by processing measured global illuminance and
measured or assumed beam, so you are comparing two "small" numbers, each
the result of subtraction of two much larger numbers, so that relatively
small errors in the original calcs are magnified by that derivation.  If
someone has time to dig into the source data you could verify or expose
another source.  Of course it could be direct measurement and just a batch
of poorly measured/calibrated/reported  data.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Could RTRACE produce two outputs (picture and
	values)?
Message-ID: <DE46D9B5CE328142B74007B522D5E6FA1CB8A458@XSERVER22B.campus.tue.nl>

Dear all,

Just a short question, unfortunately I wasn't able to find the answer on the Radiance-community:

Is it possible to create two outputs using RTRACE:

-          a .hdr picture and

-          a text file containing illuminance values.

In case of a virtual plane, rtrace has to be used instead of rpict (as explained in the Radiance Tutorial). Now, I'm doing the same simulation twice in order to get 2 outputs which takes a lot of time. Isn't it possible to create 2 outputs through only 1 simulation?
If not, could pvalue help me on this one? And if yes, how? Or would pvalue only would give me luminance values?


First simulation:
echo "     Rtrace illuminance "
vwrays -x $Dims -y $Dims -vf viewfile.vf \
| rcalc -e '$1=$1; $2=$2; $3=0.75; $4=$4; $5=$5; $6=1' \
| rtrace -w -ab 3 -fac -I -ov `vwrays -d -vf viewfile.vf -x $Dims -y $Dims` scene.oct >  Outcome.hdr

Second simulation:
echo "     Rtrace illuminance values "
vwrays -x $Dimstable -y $Dimstable -vf viewfile.vf \
| rcalc -e '$1=$1; $2=$2; $3=$3; $4=$4; $5=$5; $6=1' \
| rtrace -w -I -h -ov -ab 2 `vwrays -d -vf viewfile.vf -x $Dims -y $Dims` scene.oct | rcalc -e '$1=$1*179' > Outcome.txt


Thanks in advance for your help!

Best regards,
Mirjam

Hello,

Could you try the following two commands, by themselves? I hope it gives 
us an idea of where to begin looking for a solution.

obj2mesh -n 15 -r 16384 lens.obj > lens.msh
obj2mesh lens.obj > lens.msh

Just to muddy the question a little more, why do the TMY3 files report 
illuminance in lux but efficacy in lms/Watt?

Carolin,

Ah, I see it now. The NREL Radiance installers are for OSX versions 10.7 
and 10.8. The "Illegal instruction" error means that the compiled binaries 
use instructions that became available only in OSX 10.7.

Your options seem to be: Upgrade to 10.7, or install and build Radiance 
manually. Check out this page for instructions:

http://radiance-online.org/download-install/installation-information/mac-osx-1

Sorry about the incompatibility. We're here to help with the manual 
installation.

Mark

If you add a parameter to both rtrace commands such as "-af simulation1.amb" it will save an ambient cache in your current working directory and make the second command run faster. You will want to be sure that your ambient calculation parameters are the same for both, in your case it looks like you're taking the rtrace defaults for both. If you revise your model or calculation parameters, you will also want to manually delete the ambient cache before you run again, because you will either see strange results or an error message if you inadvertently try to use the old cache for a new calculation.

Illuminance in lux is really lumens/m? and irradiance is Watts/m?. Divide the two and the unit of area cancels out.

Subject: [Radiance-general] illuminance on external facade

Just to muddy the question a little more, why do the TMY3 files report illuminance in lux but efficacy in lms/Watt?

Hi Mirjam,

I want to agree with and embellish Christopher's reply.  Adding an ambient file will make the second simulation take very little time if indeed it is evaluating the same set of points.  However, you cannot directly compute illuminance from luminance or vice versa except under very special circumstances (i.e., reflection from a uniform diffuse surface).  They are fundamentally different calculations.

You may also try the -n option to rtrace, which combined with the -af option will speed the calculation considerably on modern multicore machines.

Cheers,
-Greg

You will want to be sure that your ambient calculation parameters are the same for both, in your case it looks like you?re taking the rtrace defaults for both. If you revise your model or calculation parameters, you will also want to manually delete the ambient cache before you run again, because you will either see strange results or an error message if you inadvertently try to use the old cache for a new calculation.

You may use the tee Unix command (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee_%28command%29 ) to redirect the rtrace outputs in two parts.

Hi Mirjam,

pixel values in a hdr file are nothing but binary-coded triplets of 
irradiance data in three channels (RGB) if you render your irradiance 
hdr image. If you have an image file containing these illuminance 
values, you can extract the data to e.g. ASCII columns using pvalue -o 
Outcome.hdr. pvalue does not interpret the data and thus does not care 
about it being irradiance or radiance, it just converts between codings. 
The -o makes sure to use the original pixel values in case any exposure 
correction had been appiled (uncommon with irradiance maps).

The advantage in using a sensor grid, not an image, to calculate 
illuminance is that you would typically use a rather coarse grid, with 
less sensor locations to be calculated. This saves time per sensor, 
allowing higher accuracy at each location. So you may prefer very high 
ambient settings for a 10 x 10 sensor grid over a 1024x1024 pixel image, 
which may force you to reduce the accuracy. This assumes that you do not 
loose relevant information from the reduced resolution (e.g. a sensor 
may happen to be shadowed by a thin frame, which would lead to 
underestimates if interpolation between sensor values is applied).

You can also use pvalue -r to create a hdr image from your ASCII columns 
of irradiance / radiance values. In that case, some information on the 
x/y dimensions must be given.

Of course, recoding pixel values does not allow you to translate 
irradiance into radiance or vice versa...

Cheers, Lars.

Subject: [Radiance-general] genklemsamp - surface orientation
Message-ID: <51560259.5080108@visarc.com>

Hi all,

I am trying to figure sampling window geometry where the normal is not 
parallel to the ground plane. So a sloped skylight for example. If I am 
passing the geometry for the glazing to genklemsamp, is all I need in 
addition, the normal for the surface? For example:

    genklemsamp -vd 1 0 1 sloped_window.rad > samples.dat

or do I need to specify view up?

Thanks,

-Jack

Hi Jack,

The view defaults for genklemsamp are the same as the rendering programs, except that it assumes a parallel view (-vtl).  The view up vector will be +Z unless you specify otherwise.  So long as it isn't parallel to your view direction, as in the case of a horizontal skylight, you don't need to specify it.

You will need to specify the interior normal direction using the kbin() function defined in klems_int.cal for your "view matrix" calculation.  Just make sure these agree with what you give to genklemsamp.

Cheers,
-Greg

Hi Carolin,

Did you end up having to use the manual build process? I thought our NREL builds of the Radiance source supported Mac all the way back to 10.6; if not, I'll have to look into how we might support earlier versions.

Carolin,

Ah, I see it now. The NREL Radiance installers are for OSX versions 10.7
and 10.8. The "Illegal instruction" error means that the compiled binaries
use instructions that became available only in OSX 10.7.

Your options seem to be: Upgrade to 10.7, or install and build Radiance
manually. Check out this page for instructions:

http://radiance-online.org/download-install/installation-information/mac-osx-1

Sorry about the incompatibility. We're here to help with the manual
installation.
