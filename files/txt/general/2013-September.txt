Subject: [Radiance-general] Spots when recreating Turrell installation
Message-ID: <CADoMKs1BnQYWGxD_N4WMTZOrpuWUVv22uyv_WbhXYSrNkn26hA@mail.gmail.com>

Folks,

If you have the chance to go to the Guggenheim in NYC, go and see the
James Turrell exhibit. You've never seen the Guggenheim quite like
this before, and as appreciators of light and its behavior, you will
find yourself both satisfied and intrigued by his installations.

I've been working to recreate a few of them in Radiance, and am
running into some difficulties. One piece, "Afrum I (White)", should
look like this:
http://nyogalleristny.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/afrum1.jpg

It's a point light in a small box above the entryway to the room, a
special 6-sided hole cut in the wall, and the light beams this
cube-like shape onto the corner. The light patch illuminates the room.

Instead, what I get looks like this:
http://markjstock.org/transfer/img06.png

Here are the relevant rendering parameters:
-ds 0.02 -lw 1e-5 -ab 5 -aa 0.03 -ar 256 -ad 1024 -as 512

I suspect that I simply need more ambient subsamples, as a few ambient
points are catching the patch and some are not. But increasing -ad and
-as do nothing to improve quality.

Or, WAIT, are those bright spots seeing the little hole (it's 6" wide)
through which the light is originally emerging? How can I prevent
that?

Hi Mark,

Funny you should be trying to simulate this -- my wife (who is an artist herself) was just down in L.A. and Turrell has what must be a very similar exhibit there, as she sent me a nearly identical photo of it.

My first guess would be the same as yours, which would be to crank the -ad parameter much higher.  You may not need to increase the -as all that much.  Finding the bright spots is the difficult part, since it is so near the horizon as seen from points on the adjacent walls.  (Cosine-weighted sampling means that the horizon gets fewer samples than the zenith.)

To avoid any contributions from the source box, make the surrounding out of a special material and name it with an -ae option.

Failing that, I would go full Monte Carlo and see if that works:

	-aa 0 -ad 1024 -as 128 -lw .0002 -ab 2

Your scene breaks one of the basic assumptions in the Radiance indirect calculation, which says that indirect lighting is fairly well-distributed in the space.  Here, you have a patch acting as a light source.

Once I implement the irradiance Hessian described in the recent Siggraph Asia paper by Schwarzhaupt et al., the situation might improve:

Best of luck!

Dear Colleagues,

It's my pleasure to continue the legacy of Canada's building performance 
simulation conference, /eSim/. Historically, eSim has hosted hundreds of 
building simulation experts from Canada and around the world.

eSim 2014 will occur at Carleton University in Ottawa on May 8 and 9, 
2014 with workshops on the day before and after. The online submission 
system is now live (esim.ca) and *250 word abstracts are due by Sept. 
27, 2013*.

I look forward to your submissions and welcome you in advance to Ottawa 
at eSim 2014.

Greg, interested parties,

Looking back at the hole in the wall (made with antimatter) I noticed
that even putting the "light bulb room" wall material and the
antimatter material in the ambient exclude list, there was still
ambient light pouring from the little room into the main viewing room.
That's what was causing the errant ambient spots. Possibly because
antimatter messes up the ambient exclude logic?

As soon as I changed the color of the little "light bulb room" to pure
black, the situation improved:

Old: http://markjstock.org/transfer/img06.png
New: http://markjstock.org/transfer/img11.png

Ambient parameters might actually be too high. But the rendering looks
nice! Turrell must have used a very black little room for his light
source!

Files: http://markjstock.org/transfer/afrum1.tar

Improvements/comments welcome. More Turrell pieces are in the works,
as I figure them out.

Hi all,

I am trying to generate a tensor tree BSDF for the 5-phase simulation, but
I get an error.

Here is what I type:


genBSDF +f +b -geom meter -dim 1 7 0.8 1.8 -.2 0 -t4 5 bsdf/windows-v80.rad
> bsdf/windows-v80_t45.xml


And it returns this error repeatedly:


rcontrib: select: domain error

rcontrib: floor: domain error

rcontrib: select: domain error

rcontrib: floor: domain error

rcontrib: select: domain error

rcontrib: floor: domain error

.

.

.

.


Does anyone know what might be wrong?
Attached is my windows-v80.rad file.

Best,
Leyla

The tensor-tree code in genBSDF hasn't yet been ported to Windows.  So, if you're under Windows, that is your problem.

Dear Sir/Madame,
I've tried using the BSDF function to create a material using Diva for Rhino. I added this line to the code :
void BSDF testmat6 0 bsdf_0c.xml 0 1 0 .00
and I'm sure that my .xml file is working as I've tried it on a BSDF viewer and it worked.Once I run the simulation on Diva for Rhino an error appears in German language. What I assume that I've wrote something wrong in the material file so that's why I cannot run the simulation. But I can't find the error, can you help me out with it?
I used the genBSDF function to convert the .rad file to an .xml file.
Sincerely,Islam Mashaly.

Hi Greg,

Thank you for your prompt reply.
I am doing my simulations on my mac, and I have the latest version of
Radiance.
If you may remember from my presentation, I modeled a room with four
openings on the south wall: two clerestories, and two windows.
Similar to my 3-phase simulation, I am trying to generate separate BSDFs
for windows and clerestories, as they have different and dynamic shading
systems. The room is positioned 3 meters above the ground (on second floor).
For the windows, I generated venetian blinds using genblind. I used -a
option in xform to duplicate the venetian blinds. Then I used xform to
position the South wall, the windows and venetian blinds on xy plane with
the interior wall facing up at z=0.  In genBSDF script, I set -dim command
to cover the two windows and the wall between them. Since I am new to
genBSDF, I am not sure what is causing the error. Does the clerestory
openings on the south wall need to be filled when creating the window BSDFs?

Please let me know if you need to look at any of my files.

Hi Leyla,

I don't think you are doing anything wrong.  In fact, the errors you were getting were due to a floating point round-off problem that up until now had never manifested.  I guess your geometry tripped it, somehow.  I have checked in a fixed version, which should eventually show up on the downloads sites.  Meanwhile, you can manually change line # 184 in your copy of genBSDF to read:

	in_disk_rgn = floor((.999995*in_disk_phi + PI/4)/(PI/2)) + 1;

The new .999995 multiplier avoids the round-off problem at phi=315 degrees.

It is unusual to model a system consisting of two windows.  Normally, you would model each window system, or just one of the two if they are identical, then re-use the generated BSDF.  Do include the window surrounds in your model as far as the sills go, but not the walls around them.  Unless you have some special reason for doing that.

Cheers,
-Greg

Hi Islam,

You have not really provided enough information to even offer suggestions as to possible causes.  The Radiance file you attached doesn't even contain your BSDF material.  It is a single-material object made of a smokey dielectric.

At the very least, you should include the error that you got and the context in which you got it.  Otherwise, no one can help you.

Best,
-Greg

Hi Islam,

The error you see is an artifact of the wxFalsecolor program trying to  
open a failed simulation file.

For DIVA-specific help it makes sense to move this discussion to the  
http://diva4rhino.com/ support forums. But in this case, you can figure  
out the explicit error by editing the  
C:\DIVA\Temp\RhinoFileName\Filename_img.bat file to include a PAUSE at the  
last line. Then just run the batch file, and you should see the error  
message direct from Radiance. With that in hand, we can probably help more.

Best,
Alstan

Subject: [Radiance-general] rcollate - A new Radiance utility!
Message-ID: <CAOG+NixKb-G5mt3geYBYx5u2x7oSM56EarY21y9v-Oo-qUb8xg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Everyone,

Greg has written new utility for Radiance - rcollate.  This utility enables
users to easily resize and transpose matrix data (text or binary).  The
program was developed to ease the five-phase method workflow for
illuminance sensor points.  It replaces awk and tr, which were only
available for unix type systems.  Now you can perform the entire five-phase
method workflow on Windows.

Here's the manpage:
https://www.radiance-online.org/learning/documentation/manual-pages/pdfs/rcollate.pdf

The five-phase tutorial has been updated to use the new utility and to
address a couple issues raised by Leyla (thanks!):
https://www.radiance-online.org/learning/tutorials/fivephasetutorialfiles/Tutorial-FivePhaseMethod_v2.pdf

Many thanks to Greg!

Best,
Andy

hallo Greg,
Hallo Michael,
Hallo jan,

Thank you for your responses, but still not sure how to proceed...


this is what i get when i type evalglare -h, i didn't know how to insert
the viewfile in a hdr picture :( ...


Last login: Thu Sep 12 10:39:52 on ttys000

nassif:Desktop nassifnassif$ evalglare -v

angle] [-b fact] [-r angle] [-y] [-Y lum] [-i Ev] [-I Ev ymax ymin] [-v]

nassif:Desktop nassifnassif$


in release notes *(from documentation_v1.0x.pdf)* , it says that:

evalglare [-s] [-y] [-Y value] [-a age] [-b factor] [-c checkfile] [-t xpos
ypos angle] [-T xpos ypos angle]

[-G type] [-vf viewfile]

[-vt*t *] [-vv vertangle] [-vh horzangle] hdrfile

I mean the -vf viewfile...ist not included in the latest version, if it is,
once again, how can i include or fix it?

P.s: if anyone doesn't have problem to help me further, i can send one of
my hdr picture that i took on site....

Thank you all in advance!,

Nassif

Hi Nassif,

it might be that the "usage output" of evalglare is not up date. 
Definitely you can use the -vf option. You just need a valid view file.
Have you tried?
You don't have to change your header of your HDR image, this is a 
command line option.

Or you specify directly -vt/t/ ,-vh and -vv .

Jan

Nassif,

I have mac 10.6.8, and I have used photosphere and evalglare on my machine
with no problems.  I work with option -vta in evalglare to specify view. I
will be happy to look at your HDR image. But before that, are sure you have
installed evalglare in the right location on you mac?

Hi all,

I am trying to use the following command to create direct sun coefficient
matrix, but I get this error : "reinsrc.cal: cannot open"


 $ cnt 5185 | rcalc -e MF:6 -f reinsrc.cal -e Rbin=recno \

-o 'solar source sun 0 0 4 ${ Dx } ${ Dy } ${ Dz } 0.533' >> skies/suns.rad


I copied reinsrc.cal from ray/src/cal/cal to ray/lib, but I still get the
error.
Can you please guide me on how to fix this.

Leyla

Leyla,

just to be sure: if you use the -vta option in evalglare you have to 
specify also the -vv and -vh option at the same time.

Gracias German!  :)

So far I've manage to complete the Exercises of the Tutorial, now I'll try

In the meanwhile: thanks for your help!!  ;)

Unlike other Radiance tools rcalc doesn't search RAYPATH.   Greg explained
that rcalc is meant to be a general utility not a Radiance program (the 'r'
in rcalc stands for record not Radiance).  So either reinsrc.cal has to be
in the current directory or you have to provide the full path to
reinsrc.cal.

Andy,

Thank you for clarifying this. I was wondering why rcalc doesn't find
reinsrc.cal
like other Radiance programs.
Thanks to Greg's 5-phase method, I am learning a lot about Radiance.

Jan,

Yes. I use -vta with -vv 180 -vh 180.

Subject: [Radiance-general] pkgBSDF weird behavior
Message-ID: <CAF-iH4+ZaaLaB6WdZCd_PprfOi_Tv+b1wPSLRK3zN4TUV58bxQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Everyone,

I have been playing with pkgBSDF and that kind of stuff, and something
weird is happening (I think).

This is my scene (of course the references are present in the respective
directories).

##### CASE

!xform Geometry/Layer0.rad

#East Shading
!pkgBSDF -s system.xml | xform -t 0 0 .02 -rx 90 -rz 90 -t 5.02 1.02 2.27
-a 5 -t 0 1.5 0

#South Shading
!pkgBSDF -s blind0.xml | xform -rx -90 -t 2.54 0 1.869

!xform Skies/sky.rad

Anyway, when I try to render, it only works without ambient calculations
(-ab 0), and only with one pkgBSDF declaration (the BSDFs are in my
RAYPATH).

When I try to render with -ab 1, it returns:

 4018 Abort trap: 6  rpict -vf Views/view.vf -ab 1 octree >
Images/south_only_AB1.hdr

When I try both together with -ab 0:

043 Abort trap: 6 rpict -vf Views/view.vf -ab 0 octree > Images/both_AB0.hdr

And, when I try both together with -ab 1:

4075 Abort trap: 6  rpict -vf Views/view.vf -ab 1 octree >
Images/both_AB1.hdr

Here you can check the images "just generated".
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fqedoyd7jdbn0uv/rNniz9rqoI

Might this be a bug? I am using the HEAD version from about yesterday...

THANKS

Germ?n

Hi Germ?n,

This is an unusual error, and not very informative.  I will attempt to reproduce it if you can send me all of your files off-list in a compressed tar file attachment (if it's not too big to mail).

Best,
-Greg

Thanks Greg,

I uploaded a file called "SunliteExport.zip" to the same folder.

Bye!

Hi Germ?n,

I tried it, and I don't get an error.  What -O setting are you using when compiling Radiance?  Anything above -O2 has been known to generate incorrect code with gcc.  Even -O2 sometimes causes runtime errors.

If you recompile and get an error using -O1, try without -O, just using -g, and run it in the debugger.  This is the only way to find out where it is going wrong.

Best,
-Greg

mmm, that is weird.

I actually did not understand anything you said, haha... I just use the
"sudo ./makeall install" command. How do I choose different -O and -g
options?

THANKS AGAIN

Hi German,

When you run makeall install, after you are asked for the location for 
the location of the executables, you will get something like the following:
> Current rmake command is:
> #!/bin/sh
> exec make "SPECIAL=" \
>     "OPT=-O2" \
>     "MACH=-Dlinux -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -L/usr/X11R6/lib 
> -I/usr/include/X11 -DNOSTEREO" \
>     ARCH=IBMPC "COMPAT=erf.o" \
>     INSTDIR=/Rlib/bin \
>     LIBDIR=/Rlib/lib \
>     ESUFFIX= \
>     CC=gcc "$@" -f Rmakefile
> Do you want to change it?
If you type "Y," this will be opened up in an editor (vi is default 
unless you specify otherwise when you first run makeall). The "OPT=" 
line is the one that you should edit according to Greg's suggestions. So 
I think that you could first try:

    "OPT=-01"

    and then if that does not help, you could try:

    "OPT="

    This will turn of optimizations.

I think that -g gives debugging output. I think that you could do the 
following to compile with this:

    change

    CC=gcc "$@" -f Rmakefile

    to

    CC=gcc -g "$@" -f Rmakefile

Hope this helps,

Best,

-Jack

Subject: [Radiance-general] genBSDF question
Message-ID: <CAN1QwsMfZzJUSDssW61BQ5Y1FR5JZByre2cAhHA5nOMMCLTaQw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am back with more questions about genBSDF. I have modeled a window with
venetian blinds on the lower part and translucent louvers on the upper part
of the window. I tried to run genBSDF with my geometry including the
blinds, louvers, glazing and the window reveal, but I did not get any
results back after 14 hours.

I know genBSDF runtime is long, but I wonder if I am doing something wrong,
or if I could change anything in my model that could make genBSDF run
faster.

Attached are the geometry files. Here is what I typed:

genBSDF -n 12 +f +b -geom meter -t4 5 reveal_glazing.rad venetian80.rad
LChazed.rad > bsdf/v80_hazed_t45.xm

Best,
Leyla

Hi Leyla,

All you can really do is play with the -c option and the rendering parameters.  You probably don't want to change -c in this case, but you can make the rendering go faster by altering the default options, which are:

	"-w -ab 5 -ad 700 -lw 3e-6"

You can try running:

	genBSDF -n 12 +f +b -geom meter -t4 5 -r "-ab 3 -ad 500 -lw 1e-5"  \
		reveal_glazing.rad venetian80.rad LChazed.rad > bsdf/v80_hazed_t45.xml

Also, I noticed that your blind slat material has 10% specularity, which probably isn't realistic unless it has a metallic coating.  I would expect the specularity to be 0.05 or less.  You are also better off specifying a non-zero roughness value unless the slats are really mirror-smooth.  

Cheers,
-Greg

 Daylighting and Simulations for Green Buildings
Message-ID: <CANQXRZV=RF_qMpzE+rn-DSRZF56eHmdaa9A5yEw3kmguaktEjg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Radiance Users,

We are conducting the 6th training program on "Passive Design, Daylighting
and Simulation for green Buildings" in New Delhi, India on 18th and 19th
October 2013. The intent of this program is to make sure that the
participants can do the analysis on their own. More information on past
workshops can be found on our Facebook
page<https://www.facebook.com/Environmental.Design.Solutions/>

*COURSE OVERVIEW:

*The objective of this highly interactive and hands-on training program is
to equip participants with the practical know-how to undertake shading and
daylighting simulations. This course covers fundamentals of solar geometry,
shading strategies, daylighting design and techniques using graphic
methods, quick calculations, rules of thumb and software tools such as
Ecotect/Skecthup and Radiance that will have direct application in practice.

The unique teaching methodology of this course introduces the concepts in a
step-by-step manner from manual exercises to using physical study models
transitioning to finally using computer simulations. Participants will work
on many exercises using our custom worksheets, physical models and software
tools switching between pen-paper media and the computer. This method will
ensure clarity in theory and effective learning of the software tool.

At the end of this course, participants will be able to conduct a complete
daylight assessment for simple geometries

Feel free to get in touch if you have any questions.

Regards

Hi Everyone,

It's been some time since I asked a dumb question of the clever people at radiance-general, so here goes...

I'm trying to render some scenes with varying illumination, in particular I want to vary the diffuseness of the illumination.

Currently I'm doing this with a hemi-field of spherical lights, with a non-homogenous density. This works fine for example <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhsMeTtIPFA&list=HL1379509671&feature=mh_lolz>

However, that's for my made-up illumination, I need to confirm that what I'm doing bears any relationship to "real" illumination, i.e. using gensky with "+s", "-s" etc.

I've tried rendering the same scene while specifying the sun position using gensky, for example this works fine:

% Gensky settings: -ang 45 45 +s
%
% # C:\Program Files (x86)\MinGW-Radiance\bin\gensky -ang 45 45 +s
% # Ground ambient level: 14.8
%
% void light solar
% 0
% 0
% 3 6.77e+006 6.77e+006 6.77e+006
%
% solar source sun
% 0
% 0
% 4 -0.500000 -0.500000 0.707107 0.5
%
% void brightfunc skyfunc
% 2 skybr skybright.cal
% 0
% 7 1 9.56e+000 2.12e+001 5.71e-001 -0.500000 -0.500000 0.707107
%

However, when I try with the -s sky:

% Gensky settings: -ang 45 45 -s
%
% # C:\Program Files (x86)\MinGW-Radiance\bin\gensky -ang 45 45 -s
% # Ground ambient level: 14.8
%
% void brightfunc skyfunc
% 2 skybr skybright.cal
% 0
% 7 1 9.56e+000 2.12e+001 5.71e-001 -0.500000 -0.500000 0.707107

It just fails to render "pfilt: picture too dark or too bright ". The -c -u -i skies also don't render.

I'm running minGW radiance in windows (with a Matlab wrapper), the +s, -s, -c and -u skies work fine when I specify time and geographical location with gensky, but I want to specify the exact sun position.

Anyone have any suggestions?

best wishes,

George

Do you have a sky dome hemisphere definition in your scene such as the following? It would have to come after your gensky command in the scene.

Hi Christopher,

Yes, that gets tagged-on by another part of the wrapper (spaghetti code). My actual world.rad file contains this:-

*******************

# C:\Program Files (x86)\MinGW-Radiance\bin\gensky -ang 45 45 -s

# Ground ambient level: 14.8



void brightfunc skyfunc

2 skybr skybright.cal

0

7 1 9.56e+000 2.12e+001 5.71e-001 -0.500000 -0.500000 0.707107

skyfunc glow skyglow 0 0 4 1.00 1.00 1.00 0
skyglow source sky   0 0 4 0 0 1 180
void plastic white
0
0
5     0.5   0.5   0.5   0.0   0.2
********************



Other bits of the scene are represented in another file <the rectangular groundplane and horse).


You did direct me to one bug, my specified sky colour was ignored and [1 1 1] was always inserted. Luckily I've only ever used a [1 1 1] sky, thanks for fixing my future-bug.


George

Have you tried adding a sky radiance level explicitly? I can't remember the correct option right now.

Hi Thomas,

I just tried: Gensky settings: -ang 45 45 -s -B 55.87

It works with +s [as it did before] but not with -s.

Have you tried adding a sky radiance level explicitly? I can't remember the correct option right now.

Hi Everyone,

It's been some time since I asked a dumb question of the clever people at radiance-general, so here goes...

I'm trying to render some scenes with varying illumination, in particular I want to vary the diffuseness of the illumination.

Currently I'm doing this with a hemi-field of spherical lights, with a non-homogenous density. This works fine for example <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhsMeTtIPFA&list=HL1379509671&feature=mh_lolz>

However, that's for my made-up illumination, I need to confirm that what I'm doing bears any relationship to "real" illumination, i.e. using gensky with "+s", "-s" etc.

I've tried rendering the same scene while specifying the sun position using gensky, for example this works fine:

% Gensky settings: -ang 45 45 +s
%
% # C:\Program Files (x86)\MinGW-Radiance\bin\gensky -ang 45 45 +s
% # Ground ambient level: 14.8
%
% void light solar
% 0
% 0
% 3 6.77e+006 6.77e+006 6.77e+006
%
% solar source sun
% 0
% 0
% 4 -0.500000 -0.500000 0.707107 0.5
%
% void brightfunc skyfunc
% 2 skybr skybright.cal
% 0
% 7 1 9.56e+000 2.12e+001 5.71e-001 -0.500000 -0.500000 0.707107
%

However, when I try with the -s sky:

% Gensky settings: -ang 45 45 -s
%
% # C:\Program Files (x86)\MinGW-Radiance\bin\gensky -ang 45 45 -s
% # Ground ambient level: 14.8
%
% void brightfunc skyfunc
% 2 skybr skybright.cal
% 0
% 7 1 9.56e+000 2.12e+001 5.71e-001 -0.500000 -0.500000 0.707107

It just fails to render "pfilt: picture too dark or too bright ". The -c -u -i skies also don't render.

I'm running minGW radiance in windows (with a Matlab wrapper), the +s, -s, -c and -u skies work fine when I specify time and geographical location with gensky, but I want to specify the exact sun position.

Anyone have any suggestions?

best wishes,

George

I assume you are rendering with -ab 1 or greater.  Otherwise, the sky will never be sampled.

Greg, thankyou!

A change I made in my wrapper a few weeks ago left out the ab setting, 
now it's back and it works.

Thanks everyone,

George

Subject: [Radiance-general] install Evalglare on my Mac (version 10.8.4)
Message-ID: <CE6127FE.17AE1%hycai@ku.edu>

Hi, all,

Sorry for sending a message to everyone. I was trying to install Evalglare on my Mac (version 10.8.4), but ran into following problems.
I don't know much on Xquartz and linux. Any help will be appreciated!

Thanks
Hongyi Cai


I downloaded "evalglare_v1.11.tar.gz" and unpacked it to a folder "evalglare", then moved the folder to my radiance folder usr/local/ray. (I also tried use/local/bin, but ran into the same warning)
Then I went to the folder "evalglare" in Xquartz, and I did the following:

don't worry too much about warnings as long as the executable is generated.
The current version is tested also under Mac.

Do you get the executable?

Subject: [Radiance-general] Unsure how to specify a trans modifier
Message-ID: <523C28A4.9060503@st-andrews.ac.uk>

Hi Everyone,

I'm trying to create a material with properties of a leaf - for a 
project examining countershading camouflage in animals, I've created 
model trees and I want them to be green in colour but with leaf-like 
transmission of light to the forest floor.

For example, I might want the colour to be [.3 .7 .1] and the 
transmission to be [.05 .25 .02].

Here's a mock-up of what I'm working on: 
https://www.dropbox.com/s/cidluvy1h8u7jqd/Horse_Trees_Panels.png.


To make it really obvious that light is passing through the material 
I've added the two floating panels, the left is opaque and the right one 
allows red light to pass through (at least it should, but I'm not 
getting any difference in the colour of the shadows).

Do I specify a colour plastic material and then a trans modifier and 
then the polygon? I've tried various script formats, so far when it 
doesn't crash I get no noticeable difference in the images with and 
without transmission specified as above.

Here's a script that just specifies a grey ground and the two green panels:

Hi George,

That sounds like a very intriguing project - I look forward to seeing some of the results.

Trans is its own material, like plastic or metal. It can act as a modifier to a polygon, but not to another material (as far as I know).  Here is one that I have used:

void trans frosted_glass
0
0
7   0.7   0.7  0.7  0 0.025  1  0.95

frosted_glass polygon rectangle_1
0 
0
12 etc. 

The 7 trans parameters are not extremely intuitive, but you can read about them in Axel Jacobs' excellent Radiance Cookbook (http://www.jaloxa.eu/resources/radiance/documentation/docs/radiance_cookbook.pdf). 

In my case, I think they mean the following:
   -0.7 0.7 0.7: the RGB values for the light that is coloured (i.e., not specularly reflected or absorbed)
   -0: the specularity of the material (in my case 0, as I didn't want or require specular reflection) 
   -0.025: the roughness (small, in my case, to account for scatter in the transmitted light)
   -1: trans; of the coloured light, how much is transmitted vs reflected (I didn't want or require light to be diffusely reflected)
   -0.05: tspec: how much of the transmitted light is specular: if you choose this to be one, it would act more like a regular glass panel. I chose 0.05 because I wanted model glass with highly diffusive properties

So of the light that hits this trans material:
   1. 30% is absorbed 
   2. 70% is transmitted, with no colour: 95% is scattered, 5% transmitted like a normal ray (although technically, I think Radiance uses a curve determined by these two parameters to scatter the light)

This is not a very realistic material, it would appear entirely black from the outside. I used it only for interior modelling with a single surface so that was of no import to me, and I wanted to avoid fiddling with both the RGB values and trans to get the final transmittance right. 

In your case, you will probably want to pick:
   -green RGB values, probably fairly low (weighted), as most of the non-green light is absorbed for photosynthesis
   -low specularity (<0.07)
   -low roughness (<0.025)
   -low trans value (depending on leaf properties, probably more light is reflected than transmitted, so 0.2-0.5?)
   -low tspec value (<0.1) because most of the transmitted light will be diffuse

I don't know if these properties have been measured for different kinds of leaves / plants, but I'd be interested to hear if they are. 

Hope that helps,

Reinier

Hi,

seams that, besides some warnings, the compilation went fine. However, the binary did not get installed yet. I do not remember now whether "make install" is provided by the Makefile, if not, copy the file evalglare into a directory which is in your path. E.g. /usr/local/bin.

Cheers, Lars.

Thank you Reinier,

That was really helpful. I have a large database of northern european 
woodland reflectance spectra (Parkkinnen et al, an IEEE paper), though 
unfortunately it's not labelled, so perhaps not that useful. Luckily I 
have a spectroradiometer so can go out and measure some target plants. 
In my example I made up my reflectances but the transmission data was 
from a maple leaf 
(http://www.apogeeinstruments.co.uk/content/transmissiongraph_large.jpg).

Thanks for the link to the book, it looks very useful! I think if I'd 
read more when I started using radiance four years ago,  I wouldn't be 
stuck re-writing my Matlab wrapper now. All my previous Radiance models 
have been for simple visual stimuli for experiments so they have all 
been grey plastics. Now I need to re-tool for leaves I have to unwrap a 
lot of spaghetti-code!

But yes, the project is really fun, here's a summary of some early work 
<https://www.dropbox.com/s/mxkhw64wd3gkd7w/Lovell_et_al_IECASAB_Poster_A4_FINAL.pptx>.

Subject: [Radiance-general] install Evalglare on my Mac (version 10.8.4)
In-Reply-To: <523C1199.1090001@ise.fraunhofer.de>
Message-ID: <CE63C8F3.17B2B%hycai@ku.edu>

Jan and Lars,

Thank you very much for your quick response. I guess I haven't got the executable (or I don't know where they are). I tried to use evalglare and got "command not found".

I checked usr/local/bin (I also checked usr/local/ray, with the same result), the folder "evalglare" is there. Inside the "evalglare" folder, I found following files:

common                  evalglare.c             gl.h                    pictool.h
documentation_v1.0x.pdf evalglare.dSYM          makefile                pictool.o
evalglare               geometry                pictool.c               platform.h

Sorry I don't know how to install the binary. Since the evalglare is already there, I did not copy it as Lars suggested.

Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks

Hongyi

don't worry too much about warnings as long as the executable is generated.
The current version is tested also under Mac.

Do you get the executable?

I downloaded "evalglare_v1.11.tar.gz" and unpacked it to a folder "evalglare", then moved the folder to my radiance folder usr/local/ray. (I also tried use/local/bin, but ran into the same warning)
Then I went to the folder "evalglare" in Xquartz, and I did the following:

Hi Hongyi

the file "evalglare" in the folder evalglare should be the executable. If you do a 'ls -al' it should have some "x"-es in the mode (rwx--x--x or similar). All you need to do is copy it to a path that is in your PATH variable or call it with its full path, e.g.  if "$>" is your command line prompt you type in /usr/local/ray/evalglare/evalglare <command line arguments>" after the "$>".

Best
Achim

Hi George,

No problem at all. Was a good test of my own understanding as well. 

Thanks for telling me a bit more about your project. I'm also doing some modelling of vegetation (hence my interest) but for a different purpose. I'm trying to determine how much light plants block (depending on the leaf density, etc.) and also how you well you can see glazing behind vegetation. 

Did you know there are a few programs that create plants/trees? There is Tree-D (http://www.frecle.net/?show=treed.about), which is free, but I have not yet found a way to properly export correct leaf shapes. Then there is Onyx (http://www.onyxtree.com/index.html), but I have no experience with that yet. Do other people?

Also, can you send me a link to the papers with reflectance / transmission spectra? I wasn't able to find them myself.

Cheers,
Reinier

Hi All - 

I'd like to make falsecolor stamp an image with a value for a single pixel of my choosing (say at 250, 300 in a 1000px x 700px image), similar to how -e works. This is to show irradiance levels changing at a given point in a sequential animation. Anybody have a trick to do this, or something like it? 

Thanks very much,
Mike

If you can live with a manual method you can use wxfalsecolor to label a point and then save the image including the label (ldr only).
Otherwise look at pvalue and psign.

Hi Michael,

I had asked a similar question several years ago on how to extract a value at a specific pixel location in the original HDR image. Greg responded with the following (you'll have to pass the result to the equivalent pixel location in the false color HDR using psign  piped into pcompos *don't forget to add the pixel width of the false color scale  to the x-location in the false color image);

From Greg??.
If you haven't passed the picture through pfilt or otherwise introduced an exposure change, then it would be much faster to use pcompos to extract the value you're interested in.  E.g.:

	pcompos -x 1 -y 1 rendered_image.hdr -Xpos -Ypos | pvalue -h -H -d | rcalc -e '$1=($1*0.265+$2*0.670+$3*0.065)*179'

If getinfo shows one or more EXPOSURE= lines in the header, then the above won't quite work and you'll need to use pvalue.  The syntax for the command you want is:

	pvalue -o -h -H rendered_image.hdr | rcalc -e 'eq(a,b):if(a-b+.5,b-a+.5,-1);and(a,b):if(a,b,a)' \
		-e 'cond=and(eq($1,x_location),eq($2,y_location))' -e '$1=$3;$2=$4;$3=$5'

Nasty, eh?  It's also slow.  Use pcompos if you can.  A faster alternative to the above is to use sed:

	pvalue -o -h -H rendered_image.hdr | sed -n 's/^ *x_location  *y_location //p'

EXAMPLE:
pvalue -o -h -H dec_cie_43-63tvis_dome_sit_west.hdr  | sed -n 's/^ *284  *248 //p' | rcalc -e \ '$1=($1*0.265+$2*0.670+$3*0.065)*179' > value.txt
_________________________

For the second part

ex:
psign -cf 1 1 1 -cb 0 0 0 -h 16 the_value_from above  | pompos     falsecolor_image.hdr +t .5 - x_location y_location >     image_out.hdr



Hope this helps,

Chris

Hi Mike,

You probably need to hack falsecolor if you want it to appear in the right place with the legend and everything.  Look for pextrem and think about how you would replace it with something that pulled out the desired pixel value like so:

	$xpos = 250
	$ypos = 300
	$lumval = `ra_xyze -o orig.hdr | pcompos -x 1 -y 1 - -$xpos -$ypos | pvalue -h -H -b -d`
	psign -s -.15 -a 2 -h 16 $lumval | pcompos falsecolor.hdr 0 0 - $xpos $ypos > composite.hdr

The ra_xyze command is to undo any exposure setting before passing on to pcompos to pull out the desired pixel, and is unnecessary and inefficient if your picture hasn't been processed by pfilt or anything that added an EXPOSURE= line.

I hope these hints get you going in the right direction.

-Greg

Funny -- I guess I'm repeating myself!  I didn't think of using ra_xyze -o before, though, so maybe a slight improvement...

Dear Radiance List

I'm coming with another question that is probably too simple but still
keeps me from moving to the next phase of  the 3Phase:

When I create the daylight matrix using genklemsamp & rtcontrib I obtain a
file with only the header and sometimes some weird symbols ike :
?7?7?7?7?7?7

 If I use such file (*.dmx) with dctimestep I get the following Error
messages :
 warning - unexpected data at the end of binary file
results/window_SOUTH.dmx

 or
 fatal - unexpected EOS reading results/window_SOUTH.dmx

 my commands are just like in the Exercise 2 of the tutorial:
 genklemsamp -vd 0 -1 0 objects/window_S.rad | rtcontrib -c 1000 -e MF:4 -f
reinhart.cal -b rbin -bn Nrbins -m sky_glow -faf model_dmx.oct >
results/south.dmx

If I try to do the same in Windows I get:

Usage: vwright {offset|name}
Argument "" isn't numeric in multiplication (*) at genklemsamp.pl line 51
Argument "" isn't numeric in multiplication (*) at genklemsamp.pl line 51
Illegal division by zero at genklemsamp.pl line 51.

 I'll really appreciate your help!

Thanks in advance!

Chantal.

Hi Chantal,

I'm not 100% sure, but I think you need to use ASCII data files under Windows, because it doesn't track the exact End-of-File, which confuses some programs.   Replace the -faf option in rtcontrib (which should be rcontrib anyway) with -faa.

Cheers,
-Greg

thanks guys, this is very helpful. I like that asking the same question twice over time ends up with multiple solutions  :)

hi
?I have used a kind of translucent ? fabric in my project that i need to know its definition as a radiance material? to use in my analysis 

i have some? characteristic of the fabric? like? solar transmittance(Ts) =18%,solar reflection(Rs) =61% ,solar absorption(As)=21%,normal -hemispherical light transmission(TV ,n-h)=17% ,normal-normal light transmission(TV, n-n)=14%
external solar factor=0.13? internal solar factor=0.37

how can I define it using above data?

Hi Mona,

This should be in a FAQ, but I'm not sure where to point you.  Maybe someone else can help with that.  Meanwhile a search on "trans" from:

	http://www.radiance-online.org/community/mailing-lists/search-1

will give you a bunch of useful hits.  If you can't figure it out, let us know.

Hello,
I'm new to the radiance thing so my question might seem an easy one.
I tried generating an .xml file for a window.rad file containing the following:****************************************************void glass windowglass003 .1 .1 .1
windowglass polygon window00120     .625      -1.3750     1.375     -1.3750     1.375     -.6250     .625      -.625****************************************************And in the genBSDF file I used the following command:
****************************************************genBSDF.exe srcwindow.rad > srcwindowbsdf.xml****************************************************
however I get the following error:
***************************************************Illegal division by zero at script/genBSDF.pl line 158.***************************************************
I tried looking any forums related to this error but I couldn't find any.
I would be grateful if anyone can guide me through the process of creating a genBSDF.xml file and adding it as a material.
Regards.
Islam Mashaly.

Islam,

I checked line 158 and it seems to be different from yours. Could you post
yours here? It should be in ray/src/util/genBSDF.pl

THANKS

Hello Islam,

As Germ?n points out, it is difficult to pinpoint your problem based on a compiled, older version of genBSDF.  However, I can guess the cause based on your input.  Normally, a sample surface should be laying in the Z-plane, but you have put yours in the X-plane.  Furthermore, your system has essentially zero thickness.  There is a line in genBSDF where it divides by the X and Y dimensions, which should never be zero, but the width in X is zero in your case.

Beyond that, I should point out that it is neither necessary nor recommended to create an XML file to describe a pane of clear glass.  Even the tensor tree format has difficulty representing perfectly specular systems such as this, and in fact all the default algorithms in WINDOW6 and Radiance work quite well with a more exact description.  Can you explain why you even think you need to do this?

Cheers,
-Greg

One scenario I can think of would be using the 3- or 5-phase method to look at a window with clear glazing and a shade, and wanting to select the appropriate BSDF based on whether the shade is up or down (at runtime). But you're right Greg, of course; given the difficulty of even a high resolution BSDF to represent purely specular transmittance or reflectance, the best way to handle these situations is to do simply calculate the view matrix with the whole model - including the glazing, modeled as glass or trans or whatever  -- and then do another round where you do the VMX to the glass and the DMX to the sky, and just have the one BSDF for the CFS. With gendaymtx, the generation of the matrices is so fast now it makes more sense to just do them both (for this scenario) and then at runtime just select the appropriate result.

You're right, Rob.  I remember I even wrote a script at some point for HMG to create clear glazing XML files, since it was faster than running genBSDF.  Faster still would be using WINDOW6 to create the appropriate XML files.

Yeah, we were gonna go a similar route with OpenStudio, including a simple library of "clear BSDFs" to be used with models, but in the end we are going to do what I described, doing a two pass daylight coefficient deal, once for the VMX with glazing, and once as a three phase pair of VMX/DMX. This was all thanks to Andy for plotting my stupid "clear BSDFs".

Which I guess means there is now technically a four phase method. =)

That makes sense... actualy, what I am doing in mkSchedule is loading the
V, D and all the Ts matrices, but the simulations is made by choosing DC
(=VTD) for each... this avoids re-multiplying VxTxD again and again. It was
much more efficient.

I did not connect my comment to the topic... what I mean, is that a loading
to mkSchedule or something a "blinds-up clear DC" could be useful for
applying this same method.
