Thanks Greg and Iebele,

Seems like there are two possible solutions: 1) per Greg's suggestion, 
monitor and wait for the files to unlock (or kill them); or, 2) create 
octrees at each iteration (if I'm understanding Iebele's suggestion 
correctly). My guess is that creating the octrees at the beginning of 
each iteration gives the OS plenty of time for the unlock to cascade. Is 
that a reasonable possibility/assumption, or did I misunderstand the 
second solution?

I will try these (and any other suggestions), and report if successful...

Thanks again!
Chris

Does anybody have a list of simulation programs using the three-phase or

My list is short:
- DaySim / EcoTect
- OpenStudio / EnergyPlus

Are there others?

Well, you can follow the example in skybright.cal to translate your equations to something Radiance can use directly.  The documentation is in:

	http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/filefmts.pdf

And there are tutorial chapters in "Rendering with Radiance" if you have a copy of that.

Hi George,

This is just off the cuff, so you may run into problems with the model, but you can start with a block of ocean water and a solar source:

!gensky 2 1 10:30

void mist seawater
1 sun
0
7 .1 .1 .1 .9 .3 .1 .9

!genbox seawater sea 200 200 100 | xform -t -100 -100 -100

-------
This should generate a 200x200 meter block of ocean 100 meters deep, with sea level referenced to 0.  There won't be any refraction effects or waves, as these would interfere with the calculation of scattering from sunlight, which I presume is the point of this exercise.  Adding objects to the ocean will add interest as you should start to see volumetric shadows if you set your rendering parameters appropriately.

Speaking of parameters, the above values for seawater are really a guess based on the following article by Maffione that Google found for me:

	http://www.tos.org/oceanography/archive/14-3_maffione.pdf

I didn't do a proper job fitting either the plot of eccentricity shown in Fig. 3 or the absorption and scattering in Fig. 5, which I eyeballed.  Fitting the Henyay-Greenstein function for scattering eccentricity I will leave to you.  The formula is:

	P(theta) = (1 - g*g) / (1 + g*g - 2*g*cos(theta))^1.5

Note that it is important to work in meters or convert the values to whatever world coordinates you are using if you prefer feet or fathoms(!)

Best of luck!
-Greg

If you are trying to simulate absorption and scattering in a participating medium, you can try playing around with the -m* options to affect the global environment.  There is also the "mist" primitive for controlling local media and scattering from specific light sources.  The single-scatter approximation used in Radiance is very approximate, however, and specifying a non-zero global extinction coefficient then having light sources infinitely distant (a la the "source" type) results in a lamentable zero contribution to the scene.

The turbidity value would be used to "scale" the distributions if you rely on the model-based assumptions instead of using measured / otherwise expected illuminance or luminance, but not when you pass that value using the -B parameter. Thus, in your case, you get a sunny sky and the turbidity is simply ignored. If you skip the -B parameter, then the sky luminance will be scaled based on the models included in gensky, and these would make use of the turbidity parameter. You can check this by varying -t and removing -B 55.87.

Happy Monday everyone, Dr. Greg,

In a few days I will be evaluating my Radiance model with measurement
data (illuminance values). Can you please recommend some
guidelines/best-practices/research-papers that have conducted
such quantitative analysis, and came out with some methodologies for model
calibration, and their confidence intervals. My university had "Rendering
with Radiance", that could have been a good starter, but somehow it has
mysteriously gone missing. It has become a rare book, if I guess right. :)

My experiment will be a controlled one, in which only the lights will be
turned On or Off and I will check their influence on results. The major
factor for anomalies could be from Sky, as initially I will be using Gensky
as the sky model.

I look forward for your suggestions. Thank you!

Best regards,
Vaib

Dear Vaib,

You should look at John Mardaljevic's Ph.D. thesis.

Hey Tim,

Just to clarify the OpenStudio piece, OpenStudio can use Radiance and the 3-Phase method for annual daylight simulation (or the one phase (Greg insists this is a two phase) method). The OpenStudio app then generates lighting schedules based on the daylight availability and lighting control setpoints which are then pushed to an EnergyPlus input file (idf) for inclusion in an EnergyPlus whole building energy simulation. There is no limit to the number of thermal zones you look at simultaneously, but you are currently limited to one space per thermal zone.

We are currently adding the ability to specify shading controls from within the OpenStudio app and SketchUp plugin; when this is done, the user will be able to select from the standard EnergyPLus shading control modes, and the effect of the shades will be calculated automatically both in Radiance for the visual and in Energyplus for the thermal. Effects of "borrowed light" from one zone to another will also be calculated correctly.

No plans as of yet to implement the 5-phase in OpenStudio, but we'd hope that there would be an easy path from an OpenStudio model to a Daysim/DIVA/SPOT/whatever space-based model, with better control simulation, where the spatial resolution of the five phase method would pay dividends.

Does anybody have a list of simulation programs using the three-phase or five-phase method?

My list is short:
- DaySim / EcoTect
- OpenStudio / EnergyPlus

Are there others?

Hi Vaib,

Anyone looking for a copy of "Rendering with Radiance" should still contact "Randolph M. Fritz" <randolph at panix.com>, who has been generously volunteering his time to distribute copies more or less at his cost.

If you use gensky or gendaylit for validation, be sure to input the global and diffuse values to calibrate them to your actual sky.  In the end, John concluded in his thesis that accurate comparisons required a full sky (directional) measurement using a sky scanner (goniophotometer or gonioradiometer).

Best of luck!
-Greg

Rob,

Thanks for the update. Can a space be part of two thermal zones? If not,
can you have "air-walls" between adjacent spaces?

Thanks,

Tim, a space must be a part of a single thermal zone. You can have multiple spaces in single thermal zone and "share" light among them with the air-wall construction, but OpenStudio does not currently "roll up" multiple spaces' loads and schedules into a single load schedule for the zone. A major limitation, I know.

Yeah yeah, I know Greg. I think I associate "phases" with "matrices", is the problem.

Once upon a time we had rtcontrib, and people traced rays from the point or pixel to the sky. There was always an extra step required, to multiply the coefficients by patch radiances to get results. The process didn't have a name, because there was just the one Way To Do It[TM]. Then along came three phase (and eventually rcontrib), and there were three matrices to compute, plus the final matrix multiplication. So when that came out and it was called the three phase method, I equated "phase" with the creation of a matrix.

So you know, really, it's like two-, or four-, or SIX-phase!

Andy, you need to update your marketing materials. =8-)

Subject: [Radiance-general] SMP file busy problem on iterative rendering
 in Linux

Dear renderers,

My solution (to the SMP file busy problem reported earlier) is to not 
use Radiance on modern virtual machines (in this case: Virtual Box 
running Ubuntu on a Windows 7 host).

Within the virtual machine (VM) environment, 4-core SMP was only about 
30% faster than single thread rendering. After installing Ubuntu 
directly onto the computer, rpiece was fast, and the file busy problems 
disappeared.

Thanks to those who gave advice...I hope this message helps future 
renderers.

-Chris

Dear Fellow Renderers,

There are numerous technical reports, peer-reviewed research papers, and 
theses making use of Radiance?much of which has stemmed from 
publicly-funded research and development. Unfortunately, some of the 
resources the public has relied upon has vanished from the Internet, for 
example:

http://www.jaloxa.eu/resources/radiance/documentation/docs/rtcontrib_lesson.pdf

What can the Radiance community do to keep a safe and freely accessible 
record of its collective work?

Sincerely,
Chris

the rtcontrib lesson has disappeared for a reason.  I don't wish it to 
be made publicly available again if anybody still has the document on

Fellow Renderers,

There are numerous documents that reference (read as: require) 
information found in the rtcontrib lesson: 
http://scholar.googleusercontent.com/scholar?q=cache:fOxLoeW5cFIJ:scholar.google.com/&hl=en&as_sdt=0,36 


My suggested long-term solution is for the community to produce and 
maintain a Radiance wiki, which would have avoided this unfortunate 
dilemma. Here are two examples of wikis that I have enjoyed using and 
learning from in my work and play:

1) The Blender Wiki: http://wiki.blender.org/
2) A video gamer's wiki: http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Oblivion

Wikis solve many communication bottlenecks and dilemmas that we are 
currently experiencing as a virtual community.

Sincerely,
Chris

My typical process is to export to .obj, then use the command obj2rad. When you export to obj, be sure to tick the box to export materials, so that any material names you've assigned in Rhino carry over into the rad files. Also, the -f option for obj2rad tends to keep each surface contiguous (rather than triangulating further than the obj export).

Hello everyone,

Falsecolor's documentation states that "The *-e* option causes extrema
points to be printed on the brightest and darkest pixels of the input
picture."

Is there any way to output (not print on image) the extrema values? This
could be helpful in appropriately scaling the "scale".

Thank you!

Hi Vaib,

A couple of things:

Thing One: there is an ?a option, which ?autoscales? the max value for the scale to peak at the max value found in the image.
Thing Two: yes, you can use pextrem to get the min and max values (in Rr,Rg,Rb) printed to the command line.

Fellow Renderers,

This is my offer and proposal for a Radiance wiki:

With your collective approval, and if enough Radiance users pledge to 
contribute to a Radiance wiki (i.e., coauthor, manage, and/or otherwise 
create, edit, and maintain pages and entries), I will offer my services 
to register a domain name, pay for the hosting, and setup the wiki server.

(Also, I would be content if someone or everyone would prefer to appoint 
someone other than myself for such an initiative.)

Sincerely,
Chris

Thank you Rob.

Am I doing it wrong? -a option is a "bad option" :) Not valid argument I
mean..
 $ falsecolor -i foo.hdr -s 1000 -n 10 -l Lux -a > bar.hdr

And pextrem doesn't take HDR file. I have to work with HDR, as it has
conversion libraries in Java.

Hi Chris,

I was about to respond to your earlier emails when this proposal came in. Thanks for your generous offer, first of all. Here's the thing: this has been tried and done before. Search the archives for radiance-general (which has stood the test of time and the ebb and flow of federal funding, BTW) and you will find initiatives started up, going all the way back to the very first Radiance Workshop in 2002. Collaborative efforts never got off the ground, and it's not for lack of someone offering to register a domain name and host the thing. People move, change jobs (careers, even), funding comes and goes, people get funny about ownership and distribution, and here's the big one: Radiance itself changes. The fact that Radiance continues to evolve and remain a high quality, well-documented bit of software is friggin' amazing to me, particularly in light of the fact that it's largely the product of one dude. But evolve it has (and does), and as it does the rules change. In response, the Radiance community takes up the new stuff (and new folks take up the old stuff), and we all document our successes and failures in various ways. There are papers, web pages, tutorials, resurrected out-of-print textbooks (thanks Fritz), all over the web, most of which are linked in some form or fashion from the radiance-general archives. And, as ever, there are the release notes, manpages, and the source code. 

Efforts are underway to make some energy modeling wikis, and some of these efforts are budgeted thousands of dollars, and they still suck, to be honest with you. I think the Radiance community does a great job on a largely volunteer basis producing what it does. The effort of maintaining a wiki, while noble, seems like just more administrative work for not a lot of benefit. The stuff is out there, and when things disappear, its usually for a good reason and when it's just someone pulled the plug on their website or whatever, these things can be found by coming to this listserv. 

I'm probably sounding like a dick right now, but all I'm trying to say is that your time would be better spent creating your own list of links and HOWTOs and adding it to the constellation of other stuff that's already out there. Again, I for one appreciate your enthusiasm and generosity. I just think that the Radiance wiki has been tried before. In fact, you might want to ping Andy McNeil because he was in the process of trying to add such a beast to the radiance-online.org site. Maybe it's an idea whose time has come, and I AM just a dick. Who knows?

Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance wiki proposal

Fellow Renderers,

This is my offer and proposal for a Radiance wiki:

With your collective approval, and if enough Radiance users pledge to contribute to a Radiance wiki (i.e., coauthor, manage, and/or otherwise create, edit, and maintain pages and entries), I will offer my services to register a domain name, pay for the hosting, and setup the wiki server.

(Also, I would be content if someone or everyone would prefer to appoint someone other than myself for such an initiative.)

Sincerely,
Chris

Vaib,

it's
'-s a', not '-a'
the following work, too:
'-s auto' and '-s Auto' (anything that starts with uppercase or lowercase 'a')

Regards

Axel

Shit, it appears that the ?a option fell off the wagon when falsecolor was converted from a csh script to a Perl script. I swear it used to be there. Am I losing my mind? This is entirely possible. OK, ok, bad info there. Sorry about that one, Vaib.

Now then, the pextrem deal. What do you mean it doesn?t take an hdr file? That?s precisely what it does. Here?s what that should look like:

$ pextrem pass2-v2lux.hdr
99 511   0.000000e+00 0.000000e+00 0.000000e+00
4 232      9.960938e-01 9.960938e-01 9.960938e-01

IOW, you call pextrem, give it an hdr image, and it returns the pixel coordinates (x,y) and radiance (Rr,Rg,Rb) of the low and high pixels. What?s happening when you try this?

Thank you Rob.

Am I doing it wrong? -a option is a "bad option" :) Not valid argument I mean..
 $ falsecolor -i foo.hdr -s 1000 -n 10 -l Lux -a > bar.hdr

And pextrem doesn't take HDR file. I have to work with HDR, as it has conversion libraries in Java.

Hello everyone,

Falsecolor's documentation states that "The ?e option causes extrema points to be printed on the brightest and darkest pixels of the input picture."

Is there any way to output (not print on image) the extrema values? This could be helpful in appropriately scaling the "scale".

Thank you!

Thank you!

I feel terrible, I should have been cautious (I need sleep).. My HDR was
currupt, as I stopped my Java procedures in the middle... I am sorry..

Yes, pextrem works fine..  Thank you Dr.Jacob for -s -a.

Hi Chris, Rob,

radiance-online.org is set up as a community website for anyone to add and
edit content. Danny and I are the only ones to have done anything, but
that's not the intent. It's not quite a wiki because we feel it needs a bit
more editorial oversight to remain relevant and accurate, but anyone can
contribute regardless. Anyone should feel welcome to register, send me an
email, and I'll promote you to author.

I also won't get in the way of, and may even contribute to, another wiki
attempt. But i'd ague that an FAQ is more necessary.

Andy

Thank you Chien Si for mentioning Ladybug.

Alejandro, You can use Honeybee which is a part of Ladybug plugin (
http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug) to prepare the geometry and
write the files (sky files, rad files for the geometry and materials).
There are components to create the materials and assign them to the
geometry.

I haven't announced the release for Honeybee yet but you can download it
form the github repository: https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/Honeybee/

Currently you can run rtrace and rpict lines from the runDaylightAnalysis
components. The project is open source though and you can modify the code
to suite the purpose of your study or you can develop a new component to
run forward raytracing simulations from Honeybee/Ladybug. The latter sounds
perfect to me! ;).

I can send you an example file if that helps.

Cheers,
Mostapha

A hearty "second" to Andy's motion for a Radiance FAQ.  As someone who is frequently re-answering questions that have already been asked (but I've forgotten I answered them already), this would be my top priority as well.  Someone knowledgeable would have to dig through the archives and pull out the interesting questions, and I'm not the best person for that.  There are also the old-old archives that should be mined for still-relevant information, and these are better organized and therefore easier to delve into:

Dear 'Googs', Fellow Renderers,

Thank you for your thoughtful response. Wikis do not take much money to 
run (far less than $50.00 per year), and they certainly do not (or 
should not) have any realized (or sense of) personal ownership. The 
information is collectively owned by the community of Radiance users, 
its contributors, and the public who pay for it. Admittedly, taxpayer 
money handlers, administrators, and other bureaucracies are perhaps 
involved in certain aspects of Radiance and its software; however, the 
information can and should be freely accessible?a state that is not as 
transparent or fully realized as the insiders and professionals of the 
Radiance community might believe or project onto the public.

Admittedly, many wikis fail, although many (i.e., all currently 
existing) wikis succeed, which is why I showed two successful, active, 
and useful wikis of sufficiently divergent topics and obscurity to make 
my earlier point. In addition to Wikipedia.org, there are countless 
wikis that are supported by communities of the same size as the Radiance 
community (in other words, we have critical mass, but still need 
critical collective exertion/belief/effort, etc..) If Radiance were born 
today, there would be no question as to whether or not to inform the 
community with a wiki. In fact, I can't think of any other serious 
software besides Radiance that doesn't have an active wiki where faq's, 
tutorials, and examples are shared and edited by the community...what 
does that say about our current situation?

Most of your arguments, from my perspective, are actually in favor of 
having what I would call decentralized content. Clones, backups, 
redundancy, historical tracking, and forking (if and whenever necessary) 
are just a few of the advantages of wiki content, which is naturally 
fully capable of supporting fast-changing and evolving topics such as 
Radiance. In fact, wikis are better at this than the current 
web/email/gatekeeper/server/owner models. The content should be shared, 
copied, archived, cloned, and forked as the evolution of the software 
and its users (USERS, are not exclusive to paid professionals and 
developers) deem sufficient and/or necessary. It is just a matter of 
time before a wiki is realized by current or future Radiance users?the 
relevant questions are: how much time will it take; who (if anyone) has 
to retire, step aside or be ignored; and who will be brave enough to 
champion the inevitable: a completely shared, open, free, nonlinear, 
user-based Radiance community?

The problem with naysayers is that they either fundamentally 
misunderstand or loathe the concept realized by Wikipeida and its 
clones. Bureaucratic entities are horrible at sharing information 
(because they want to, or must, control it), which may be part of the 
reason for why it is presently so darn hard for folks to freely learn 
and use Radiance. Perhaps this is an anticipated or desired effect, but 
fundamentally Radiance is fantastically simple to understand and use, 
once you figure out how to get a book, find a mentor, or otherwise get a 
handle on the current instructional tools. The current problem and 
reason why the Radiance community is not larger is because the teaching 
methods are outdated and obscure. Better methods of communication have 
been around since the birth of Wikipedia. Furthermore, the 
radiance-general mailing list is not as intuitive and easy to use for 
beginners as it might appear to someone who has been in the business 
since the very first Radiance workshop. And when (the linear and clumsy) 
radince-online server shuts down, who is going to pick up the pieces and 
carry on the legacy past our current generation? Probably Google, which 
is the only real way to access (read as: stumble upon) radiance-online 
content. Wikis are for all levels of users, including beginners and 
advanced, who will eventually be responsible for the software and 
community's future. Newsflash: you can't make money writing content for 
using Radiance. So, why not make it free, freely available, freely 
editable, and freely distributable? I urge anyone to think hard about 
this question before submitting a pseudo-philosophical answer.

As I noted in my earlier email, I am interested in hearing from positive 
responders (e.g., the thoughtful and defiant students who value the 
points that I am trying to communicate in this thread, the artists who 
want to share and inspire their work, the scientists and mentors who 
want to advance our collective knowledge?in a freely open and 
fully-peer-supported fashion). I am represented in all of those 
descriptions, and I imagine or hope that there are many like me. Let's 
get together and compare notes, publicly or privately. The professional 
naysayers, administers, gatekeepers, and content owners might best serve 
the public by simply listening to (or ignoring) this thread, short or 
long as it may be...

Sincerely,
Chris

Search the archives for radiance-general (which has stood the test of time and the ebb and flow of federal funding, BTW) and you will find initiatives started up, going all the way back to the very first Radiance Workshop in 2002. Collaborative efforts never got off the ground, and it's not for lack of someone offering to register a domain name and host the thing. People move, change jobs (careers, even), funding comes and goes, people get funny about ownership and distribution, and here's the big one: Radiance itself changes. The fact that Radiance continues to evolve and remain a high quality, well-documented bit of software is friggin' amazing to me, particularly in light of the fact that it's largely the product of one dude. But evolve it has (and does), and as it does the rules change. In response, the Radiance community takes up the new stuff (and new folks take up the old stuff), and we all document our successes and failures in various ways. There are papers, web pages, tutorials, resurrected out-of-print textbooks (thanks Fritz), all over the web, most of which are linked in some form or fashion from the radiance-general archives. And, as ever, there are the release notes, manpages, and the source code.

I think the Radiance community does a great job on a largely volunteer basis producing what it does. The effort of maintaining a wiki, while noble, seems like just more administrative work for not a lot of benefit. The stuff is out there, and when things disappear, its usually for a good reason and when it's just someone pulled the plug on their website or whatever, these things can be found by coming to this listserv.

Again, I for one appreciate your enthusiasm and generosity. I just think that the Radiance wiki has been tried before. In fact, you might want to ping Andy McNeil because he was in the process of trying to add such a beast to the radiance-online.org site. Maybe it's an idea whose time has come, and I AM just a dick. Who knows?

Hi,

as I second that a FAQ would be really useful, a short comment. I am among the many who brought up that idea here and than. The infrastructure is rather easy to set up. I did with a CMS (Drupal), a FAQ template to fill, some useful tools such as a TeX interpreter to enable writing math into the FAQ. It works well. Pitfalls are others:

1) spammer - even with spam protection, a site without content review gets filled with spam easily - captchas do not entirely filter out this

2) the volume of the knowledge around - compiling a list with only the top 20 Q&As is a lot of work if you want to be accurate (e.g. trans definition...), and than - chances to find a solution to my specific question are still higher using the search engine of the mailing list archive

3) maintenance - the archives have recorded decades of discussions in a quite complete approach, who can commit to capture just, say, the next five years

So I think it would be useful, I did not even give up my futile attempt, but learned that given my limited time budget it will take me a year just to complete the top ten Q&As...

Cheers, Lars.

Thank you Andy and Greg,

Please do consider the points I've raised in the last email, and let's 
hope that the community makes an effort to upload content. I am willing 
to partake in the organization and uploading of portions of the 
radiance-online content, but a plan of action would be a good first task.

Also, there are numerous ways to set up a wiki. I personally like the 
homepage of http://wiki.blender.org/ and was able to teach myself 
everything I needed to learn through their intuitive structure. The 
software is provided freely by: http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki 
--I'm not an advocate of any particular wiki distro, but some just work 
better and look prettier than others.

Thanks to all!
Chris

Message-ID: <CAD7gt0XNp4-uyxfLHYdiAku5BecttQQcTdLZ8kX2a_WbjaAdAg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone!

getinfo command does not input .bmp file, and I want to check the
resolution of a .bmp file converted from .hdr file using ra_bmp. Since
getinfo takes .hdr files, so my question is:

Does the resolution of .hdr and converted .bmp (using ra_bmp) remains same?

Thank you!

Best regards,

Francesco's Radiance Wiki is here:
http://www.bozzograo.net/radiancewiki/doku.php

At one point, there was also a Radiance Documentation Project, but the 
URL seems to time out:
http://radiance.free-architecture.org/

Also, the digest that Greg used to send out in the early days was 
superb. Not sure many people are aware of it:
http://www.radiance-online.org/archived/radsite/radiance/digests_html/rad_dig_HOME.html

Call to arms (2006) is here:
http://radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2006-leicester/Presentations/AxelJacobs.pdf
Feel free to skip to page 20 if you don't care about open source licenses.

I am hoping that this time 'round, we'll get more volunteers.

Best

Axel

"Yes" is the short answer.  Size should not change in ra_bmp.

Chris,

Sorry if some of us appear to be cynical, but I thinly you're off the mark
dismissing those with less enthusiasm as naysayers who "fundamentally
misunderstand or loathe the concept" of wikis.  I think I can speak for
everyone when I say that we would love for there to be the level of
documentation you propose. Unfortunately funding for documentation isn't
available, so it is generally a personal time activity.

As Rob pointed out (who, by the way, has been instrumental in making
Radiance available to Windows users and deserves all of our gratitude)
setting up and hosting a wiki isn't much of a hurdle, so a pledge to do
that isn't all that meaningful. Instead, a pledge to spend 200 hours this
year creating content for a wiki is substantially more meaningful, and
would likely be met with more enthusiasm.

As Axel pointed out in his 2006 presentation, most of the work of wiki
documentation is done by 1% of the users. It's nice to think if you build
it they will come, but unfortunately that has been demonstrated false (at
least for this community) and we'll need to do more than just "hope that
the community makes an effort to upload content."

Ultimately, the challenge you'll face in starting a successful wiki is
getting buy-in from a broad base of users and motivating 1% of the Radiance
community to contribute substantial time adding content. Unfortunately, I
think you'll have to rely heavily on the people you deem naysayers, because
they are the ones who have been in the community the longest. Your appeal
to the students in the community to do the heavy lifting seems misguided,
we spend significant time helping some students with their problems only to
never hear from them again after their dissertation is completed, so I
don't think they share your motivation.

Here's my 2 cents on what will make your efforts a success:
1 - Make a more meaningful pledge towards creating a wiki rich with content
2 - Proactively seek buy-in and support from everyone within the Radiance
community (not dismiss  people with less enthusiasm as naysayers).
3 - Work tirelessly to deliver content. Unfortunately you'll probably be
working alone at first.

If you decide to proceed by pledging a substantial amount of your time to
add content, I will pledge 40 hours of my personal time this summer to add
content.

Good luck and godspeed my friend,
Andy

Andy, et al.,

Proposal sounds very good. I pledge 40+ hours before June 21, 2014. Is 
there a consensus on which wiki site is best?

Thanks to all!
Chris

Awesome! Does anyone else feel the urge to pledge some time to adding
content to a Radiance wiki? Any hour for hour matches? (KQED is having it's
pledge drive this week, so I'm in a pledge drive kinda mood).

Andy

Message-ID: <52F2E480.6070503@umn.edu>

Just thinking about strategy:

1) start with manpages
2) go through radiance-general, adding content and linking relevant 
manpage(s)
3) add major topics (installation, tutorials, etc.)
4) go back and fill in blanks, while keeping up with radiance-general 
(unless realtime updating of wiki can occur with Q&A and software updates).

Question: what, if anything, can be copied verbatim? Inverse question: 
What needs to be rewritten (code, text, images) to avoid copyright 
violations? It may be best to initially add placeholders where direct 
copying is a problem, and content needs to be rewritten.

BTW: I am open to any and all concerns and criticisms, and always glad 
to be wrong--if someone can propose a solution. Happy to be one of the 
graduates who gave back to the community, after having written my 
dissertation...

Thanks again for the advice and opportunity.

Sincerely,
Chris

Chris, Andy et. al.,

Now that this is going to happen here is my 2 cents.

I think everybody agrees that there is already so much really valuable
information in the email list. I have personally found the answer to many
of my questions by reading the emails from the archive but always suffered
from the poor layout. The attachments are missing and in some cases it is
really hard to follow the conversations.

I would be happy to devote some time to develop the code to parse the email
archive and put them in a better format that is easier to follow. I
personally like the layout of Grasshopper discussion pages which is similar
to many other pages on the web. Just a random example: (
http://www.grasshopper3d.com/forum/topics/window-forms-param-data-binding)

Any of the options provides an API that let us problematically generate
discussion pages from the current emails?

Mostapha

Mostapha, all,

Parser sounds very helpful, as well as Grasshopper discussion page 
layout, and pretty much every other suggestion. If the majority agrees, 
and everyone's had a chance to make suggestions, I will review this 
thread, follow instructions, and get busy archiving later this month.

Thanks,
Chris

Subject: [Radiance-general] 2.5-phase method and gendaymtx
Message-ID: <CA+dqh61o4Jpaz4XX=SiATVj+bsHakbeMHgLxMzaNCx027XKbHg@mail.gmail.com>

(Couldn't come up with a sillier subject line for this)

Dear list,

I am trying to use rcontrib and dctimestep in my only-just-invented
2.5-phase method.  The idea is simple: Instead of relying on the patch
brightness to represent both sun and sky, I would like to only use the
patches for the sky, and rely on 'real' suns for an annual simulation.
 This is somewhat related to Andy's 5-phase method, but but I'm still
at the stage where I have simple windows and no BSDF or Klems stuff.
What I am hoping to find out is whether the inclusion of 'proper' suns
makes a difference compared to the old skool rcontrib approach where
the sky patches represent the sun + sky.

I've tarred up the script and all the input files.  They are available here:
http://www.jaloxa.eu/pickup/cbdm4_diffdir.tgz

The script is a bit lengthy:

What I am measuring is the horizontal unobstructed irradiance.

The first five columns are essentially the wea file:
month    day    time    in_dir    in_diff
to which the following have been laminated:
dir:  gendaymtx -5 -d; no sky, just 145 suns
diff:  gendaymtx -s; no suns, Tregenza patches, only diffuse contribution
dir+diff: dir + diff
comb: gendaymtx; no suns, Tregenza patches, diffuse and direct
contribution.  This is old skool for comparison.

I simply cannot make any sense of the results,  so I'm wondering
whether I am misunderstanding the concept behind the -5 option to
gendaymtx.

Take, for instance, this row:
1 1 8.500 0 19    6.01    6.01    12.02    6.01
There is no direct irradiance recorded in the wea file.  Yet, the
gendaymtx/rcontrib calculation produces 6.01 W/m2 (very low-angle
sun).
Also, I don't get why dir = diff = comb ???

I am probably using gendaymtx and rcontrib improperly, but have been
staring at this for quite a few hours now, without being able to work
out where I am making the mistakes.

Would anybody be able to offer assistance with this?

I have also tried doing the same think with genskyvec.  It doesn't
complain when I give it the -5 option, but the results are simularly
confusing.

Many thanks for your help

Best regards

Axel

Regarding manpages, I still have this url bookmarked, but I'm fairly sure these are updated at most on the occasion of major version releases. For example, rtcontrib is listed but not rcontrib.

Just thinking about strategy:

1) start with manpages

I did  not go through all the lines, but don't you want to use the -I swith
in rcontrib!?
(I hope I didn't miss anything in the lines I did not properly work
through...)

Christoph,

I had similar issue with gendaymtx while ago. I asked Rob about it and he
showed me this link that you can find the updated manual pages:

Arrrg!!! School boy mistake.  Thank you for spotting this, David.

here is a snippet from the new results file:

month    day    time    in_dir    in_diff    dir    diff    dir+diff    comb
1 1 0.500 0 0    0    0    0    0

1 1 4.500 0 0    0    0    0    0
1 1 5.500 0 0    0    0    0    0
1 1 6.500 0 0    0    0    0    0
1 1 7.500 0 0    0    0    0    0
1 1 8.500 0 19    0.2066706    18.90211    19.1087806    18.90211
1 1 9.500 7 51    1.282733    50.74105    52.023783    51.63825
1 1 10.500 17 88    6.208754    87.54448    93.753234    91.38906
1 1 11.500 22 109    7.98244    108.4224    116.40484    114.1101
1 1 12.500 22 110    8.004499    109.4393    117.443799    114.9813
1 1 13.500 17 91    6.269868    90.53477    96.804638    94.47253
1 1 14.500 4 56    1.028895    55.71151    56.740405    56.35708
1 1 15.500 0 6    0.07238894    5.968799    6.04118794    5.968799
1 1 16.500 0 0    0    0    0    0

There still is a small residual direct irrdiance from the suns when
dir in the wea file is zero, but I guess I can live with that.
Also, diff+dir is always slightly higher than comb, but overall a
fairly good match.

Thanks again

Axel

No problem!
The errors in the direct component seem a bit high (at least relatively),
but I guess that is due to the quite low direct values and what the model
behind the calculation makes out of it. I would expect the relative error
to be way lower for higher direct values...

Cheers,
David

Hi Axel, et al.,

I have not poured over your script here, and maybe I'm just confused, but I
think what you describe is similar to what can be done in the current
DAYSIM.  DAYSIM creates one set of daylight coefficients for the sky
patches and ground (145+3ground) and one set of daylight coefficients for
the direct sunlight positions which typically ends up being anywhere from
60-65 coefficients.  The solar coefficients are for every hour for 5 sample
days thoughout the year: the solstices, equinox, and an apr/aug 21 and
feb/oct 21.  For orientation or latitude freedom, these could be run for
the broader set of solar locations described in the DDS documents by Denis
Bourgeois (A Standard Daylight Coefficient Model for Dynamic Daylighting
Simulations) but not sure if DAYSIM has this implemented or not.  My
projects never seem to have such freedoms ;-)

I still use this method, even with BSDF files, as I feel it better
addresses the sun and is more accurate than spreading that flux over 3
patches as the '3-phase' method does.  I have found that using "proper
real" suns can but not always make a difference on results.  Even with
dynamic BSDF or other elements, if there are only two-positions (which is
common for me - up or down), I will just run this method for the two
positions rather than resorting to the 3-phase method and the sun smearing
issues.

Perhaps it would be good to really clarify, and define as a community, what
is meant by all these "phases".  Here's my two cents.  I had always thought
of it as basically "phases of flux transer", not phases of calculation or
number of matrices.  I was surprised to hear at the last conference that
"3-phase" came from phases of calculation I think.  Although we never count
the final perez sky iteration step as a phase, I don't think.  Anyways, I
have always thought about and referred to the different Daylight
Coefficient (DC) methods this way:

1-phase:  Original method (maybe implemented in early versions of DAYSIM?)
that simulataes one phase of flux transfer: a set of skypatch-to-calc point
DC's.  The sky and solar flux are then both assigned to the patches in an
annual perez sky iteration step.

2-phase:  What is currently in DAYSIM.  Two phases of flux transfer: one
set of skypatch-to-calculation point DC's and one set of solardisc-to-calc
point DC's.  The annual perez sky iterations step then assigns the sky flux
to the patches and the solar flux to the closest 4 sun locations as
described in DAYSIM docs.

3-phase:  Method to allow for dynamic facade elements breaking up the
simulation into 3 phases of flux transfer: a skypatch-to-facade element set
of DC's (the daylight matrix), a BSDF file describing the facade element
(the transfer matrix), and a facade element-to-calcpoint set of
coefficients (the view matrix).  Like the 1-phase method, the annual perez
sky iteration step assigns all flux to the sky patches including the solar
disc to the surrounding 3.  This method is very useful when orientation
freedom is needed and when there are numerous dynamic facade positions to
analyze but is subject to the errors of smearing solar flux into 3 patches
each ~10deg wide.  For non-dynamic or even 2 position dynamic and non-BSDF
windows I have always thought of this as a downgrade from the 2-phase
DAYSIM method.

4-phase:  When I first heard about a new "5-phase" method being developed -
I thought it would be something like this:  basically the 3-phase but with
2 daylight matrices, one for the sky patches and one for the sun locations
(either using the 60-65 sun method or the DDS method).  So there would be
one phase from skypatches-to-facade element, another phase of
solardisc-to-facade element, a transfer phase (BSDF files), and a facade
element-to-calcpoint phase.  I still think there is potential here,
especially when a dynamic facade is needed but there is no
orientation,latitude freedom to the project.  The perez iteration would
then assign sky flux to the sky coefficients and solar flux to the closest
4 positions like in the 2-phase method.

5-phase:  What was presented at the last workshop that I am not totally
clear on.  From what I understand it is best for fully dynamic facade
elements and full orientation and latitude freedom - best for large
research efforts.  A more complete set of solar locations (like the DDS
method) are used but to avoid problems with calculating these many
locations there is a subtraction process to derive them?  Sorry, my
understanding of this effort is not extremely clear and I don't have time
at the moment to read up on it.  I am sure someone here can clarify.

Anyways, I think it would be nice for me, and the daylight simulation
community, to have a clear understanding of these different annual daylight
simulation methods, their names, and which method is appropriate for which
design problems.  On a side note, SPOT implements another climate-based
annual daylight simulation method, coined a Design-Day Interpolation
method, that matches the 2-phase DAYSIM approach very closely and I have
seen less eratic results deeper in spaces with it ( I think because they
are more reliant on the single sky patch they see out a window).  This is
what SPOT uses for dynamic shading analysis which is limited to 2-positions.

Sorry, this ran away from me but has been something on my mind for a while
that your question triggered.  I would love to hear others take on this and
please correct anything I have misunderstood or mis-stated here.  I have
thought about starting an IESNA Daylighting Simulation Sub-committee to
author an LM that nails down all these issues with climate-based annual
daylight simulation, anyone else interested in participating in such a
group?  I could write-up a draft PIF (Project Initiation Form) to get the
ball rolling.  Or maybe this is just a new effort for the IESNA Daylight
Comittee since the RP-5 is all wrapped up?

Regards,
Zack

Hi Wouter,

thank you for spotting this.  Yep, this is yet another mistake I made. 
I was trying to boil down my actual, much longer script to the bare 
minimum.  However, but this detail seems to have escaped me.

I'm a little amazed now that the my version worked at all.

Thanks for your help with this.

Best

Axel

Hi Zack,

I have to admit that calling it 2.5-phase was a bit tounge-in-cheek of 
me.  All those different phases keep confusing the living daylight out 
of me, and by reading the posts on this list, others see to share 
similar sentiment.

Anyhow, and I'm glad you pointed this out. My intention with the little 
2.5p exercise was exactly this--to compare Radiance to DaySim.  I have 
to admit that to me, DS is a bit of a black box, but this is probably 
only because I don't use it much.

Also, nailing down a nomenclature of dds terminology is a great idea.  I 
think there is much confusion as to what the different methods and 
software packages can and cannot do, so having some overview of 
capabilities, fields of application, accuracy, limitations etc would be 
great.

And:  How about test cases?  Has anybody ever compared, say, DaySim 
against Radiance for DDS.  There are quite a few clever algorithms that 
only seems to exist in DS, not anywhere else, making a verification of 
DS results against Rad rather challenging.  What can DS do that Radiance 
can't, and vice versa?

Best

Axel

Hi Axel,

I can't say I fully understand the innerworkings of the DS algorithms but I
believe they are really just an implementation of rcontrib probably similar
to what you are working on.  There is a little diddy it uses called
"gen_dc" that automatically generates the skypatch and solar array DC
files.  This calls out to an "rtrace_dc" program which I think was the
precursor to rcontrib.  It then has a couple programs that use those DC
files to perform annual simulations.  One called "ds_illum" which uses the
DC files and a weather file, creates perez sky models and assigns flux to
patches and solardisc locations, and ultimately creates an annual
illuminance file.  I would like to see this annual illuminance file format
become a standard as well.  All the new dynamic daylight metrics we are
developing can be calculated from this one annual illuminance file and SPOT
creates an identically formatted annual illuminance file.

Regards,
Zack

I can't pretend to understand the inner workings of DaySim, either, but I know there are some differences with rcontrib.  These differences will lead one to prefer one or the other depending on simulation needs:

o	rcontrib uses a form of pure Monte Carlo to break illumination contributions into any desired number of components.  This flexibility allows it to be applied in a wide variety of circumstances, such as the 3-phase and 5-phase method.

o	DaySim computes 145 components throughout a more standard application of the Radiance rendering & calculation tools, allowing it to take full advantage of irradiance caching at the expense of some generality.

o	rcontrib is a "dumb" but highly programmable tool, and by itself doesn't do anything useful.  It currently needs conjoined with a script, cal file or program to make it useful, and a number of these have been written such as genBSDF, genklemsamp, klems_int.cal, etc.

o	DaySim includes a complete simulation of daylight control in a single interior space and is much easier to apply in typical situations, but may be harder to adapt to unusual conditions.

I hope this helps.  Maybe Christophe can chime in with his thoughts.

-Greg

There is a little diddy it uses called "gen_dc" that automatically generates the skypatch and solar array DC files.  This calls out to an "rtrace_dc" program which I think was the precursor to rcontrib.  It then has a couple programs that use those DC files to perform annual simulations.  One called "ds_illum" which uses the DC files and a weather file, creates perez sky models and assigns flux to patches and solardisc locations, and ultimately creates an annual illuminance file.  I would like to see this annual illuminance file format become a standard as well.  All the new dynamic daylight metrics we are developing can be calculated from this one annual illuminance file and SPOT creates an identically formatted annual illuminance file.

Axel,

This line of your script may be the cause of your problem:

> gendaymtx -5 -d -m $REINHART -c 1 1 1 -O1 $WEA > $dsmx


-d works by changing the sky color to 0 0 0. Then the -c option later in
your command negates the -d option by changing the sky color to 1 1 1.

I only know this because I made this mistake in a script I sent to Rick.
Rick discovered that it wasn't working and Greg told us how gendaymtx
actually works.

Andy

Hi Andy,

thanks for sharing this.  I did realise that -c affected the sky, but 
left it in there just in case.  Would you happen to know whether 
genskyvec works exactly the same way as gendaymtx with regards to -d, 
-5, -s, -c?

Regards

Axel

There's no -5 or -s option for genskyvec. And from what I can tell the -d

-d.

Greg, am I right?

That's right.  With genskyvec, you would give the -s option to gensky, instead.  And although there's no reason to specify the sky color with -d, since there is no sky, setting it after -d in genskyvec doesn't turn the sky back on like it does in gendaymtx.

Crossing over to the general list...

If you can create an octree from your model, try the command and option getinfo -d

That will return the dimensional information for your full scene though, so if there are objects included outside of your area of interest, it becomes more tricky.

Subject: [Radiance-dev] How to parse room dimensions from .rad model ?

Hello everyone,

It is a kind of weird question but thought to hear your views.

Let's say, someone gave me a .rad file which is a model of a rectangle room. This model has many polygons for surfaces such as walls, windows, luminaire, furniture etc.

How shall I develop a method/function that can parse this .rad file and return me back the room dimensions. I have no additional information, like walls' name variable etc.

I want to make a simple java method for that. I am not using any CAD API.

Is it possible? Please don't bash me for my stupid question.. :P

Best regards,
Vaib

Yes, let's keep this on the general mailing list.  The dev list is primarily for development/debugging issues.

The getbbox command will give you a tight box (right rectangular prism) on the entire scene, whereas oconv will report an enclosing cube.  However, this won't help you much if your space is non-rectangular or not axis-aligned.

A general tool for extracting the walls from a room is technically the 3-D convex hull problem.  There are programs out there to compute this, but I haven't played with them.

Best,
-Greg

Message-ID: <52F56161.6020607@jilldalglish.com>

Hello,

What is the best way to search the Radiance Online archives?

I am trying to find the obj/misc directory of my newly-installed NREL 
Radiance download on my Mac to run the "%  rad -o x11 daf.rif" as the 
ReadMe.pdf file suggests. (I'm also trying to find the "ray" directory 
and the "rad" command, but that is secondary.)

Thank you,

Hi Jill,

A couple of ways to search the archives. One is to just rely on Google, but
a better way is to browse the archives here:

http://www.radiance-online.org/community/mailing-lists/archives/radiance-general

The best way is usually to search the archives here:

http://www.radiance-online.org/community/mailing-lists/search-1

...but this doesn't seem to be working at the moment. Boo.

Now then, your specific question: the so-called NREL Radiance binaries do
not include the obj directory because they are not part of the program,
they are just "auxiliary" files. You can get them by downloading this
archive:

http://www.radiance-online.org/software/non-cvs/rad4R1supp.tar.gz

...and unpacking the archive like so:

tar -xzf rad4R1supp.tar.gz

Once you have those, you'll also wanna make sure you have X11 installed. I
like XQuartz for that, which you can get here:

http://xquartz.macosforge.org/downloads/SL/XQuartz-2.7.5.dmg

Then you should be able to run that example scene you're trying to do. I
would recommend looking at some of the other tutorials on the
radiance-online site, though.

- Rob

Candidate for the FAQ:

Radiance rview was renamed to rvu when the VIM editor decided that "rview" was the name they wanted for a restricted, read-only invocation of "vi".

Either put the Radiance executable directory before the one with VIM in it, or get used to calling "rvu" instead.

On second thought, the actual error is very strange.  Radiance has never had a software registry key that I know of.  If running "rvu" generates a similar error, please let us know where this installation originated.

Dear members,

 

I'am making an daylight simulation of an atrium. I get the model from an
architect and translate this to radiance with Ecotect.

I have make tho file's with model information xxx.rad and these file are
working well when you calculate the saperatly.

But when I combinate this file's in one model I get the massage "Internal -
set overflow in addobject"

how can I solve this?

 

In the appendix the calculation

 

kind regards

Hi Sierd,

first, it is important to understand that the problem indicates that the way the scene was modeled is probably not very suitable for light simulation. As a general advice, model geometry only which is relevant to the simulation output you expect - try to avoid too much detail. In this case, probably you either have lots of overlapping surfaces, or a huge amount of surfaces which are very long an thin, which may happen with bad meshing algorithms...

As an immediate solution, you can try to make oconv accept more surfaces in each voxel and help out by starting with a higher octree resolution. E.g. try setting higher -r values, e.g.

oconv -r 32768 -n 7 (your rad files) > (your octree file)

This may make the rendering slower...

This is a typical FAQ, if you enter the subject line into your favourite search engine, you will find lots of related mails, e.g.

http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-January/008318.html

Cheers, Lars.

getbbox will solve the issue at hand. Rooms/scenes are mostly right
rectangular prism; and also they are normally kept aligned with principal
axes, only the sky (if with sun) is rotated to change the North. I guess,
to rotate the sky instead of the scene must be preferred for modeling
architectural scenes in Radiance.

Further, just out of curiosity: getinfo -d foo.oct gives [Xmin, Ymin, Zmin,
Size] of the bounding cube (I guess cuboid too?). I couldn't figure what
does Size mean? Is it Xmax or Y/Zmax?

Thank you for your time!

Best regards,
Vaib

The size returned by "getinfo -d octree" is the cube side length, which is of course the same in all three dimensions.

Thank you Dr.Greg. It makes sense now.

I am just curious to know your opinion on changing the site's North by
rotating the Sky. Do you think it is a good practice? Because on rotating
the building/room, one cannot take full advantage of other good programs
such as getbbox and/or getinfo -d.

Hi Vaib,

Yes, that?s generally how folks do it with Radiance, is rotate the sky to mimic an off-axis building footprint. It?s done for the reasons you cite, as well as for efficiency in the octree. There are a few posts on this on the archives.

getbbox will solve the issue at hand. Rooms/scenes are mostly right rectangular prism; and also they are normally kept aligned with principal axes, only the sky (if with sun) is rotated to change the North. I guess, to rotate the sky instead of the scene must be preferred for modeling architectural scenes in Radiance.

Further, just out of curiosity: getinfo -d foo.oct gives [Xmin, Ymin, Zmin, Size] of the bounding cube (I guess cuboid too?). I couldn't figure what does Size mean? Is it Xmax or Y/Zmax?

Thank you for your time!

Best regards,
Vaib

Yes, let's keep this on the general mailing list.  The dev list is primarily for development/debugging issues.

The getbbox command will give you a tight box (right rectangular prism) on the entire scene, whereas oconv will report an enclosing cube.  However, this won't help you much if your space is non-rectangular or not axis-aligned.

A general tool for extracting the walls from a room is technically the 3-D convex hull problem.  There are programs out there to compute this, but I haven't played with them.

Hey gang,

Besides Andy?s (awesome) BSDFViewer util, does anyone have any other fave ways to plot the distribution of their BSDFs? Anybody have an R or gnuplot script to take a plain old Klems basis BSDF xml file and make a (series of) polar plot(s)?

Hi Rob,

I would be game to try writing something with R.  I'm aware of Andy's BSDF
viewer and it is indeed awesome.

Is there a particular project / task driving this interest? Batch
visualizations?

Hey Kyle,

I?m making a bunch of generic BSDFs for window substitution in OpenStudio and thought it would be nice to have a couple of simple data visualizations of each one, for the docs. Kind of a back burner thing, just wondering if this has been done already. What I *don?t* know about R could fill a book, but I do know it?s pretty capable?

Hi Rob,

I used OpenDX to generate nice 3D-solids for selected incident angles from measured BSDF. These could be either exported as vrml or rendered in DX. For the xml-format, you could check bsdf2rad from head, which makes it easy to include a visualization step into scripts.

Cheers, Lars.

Hello Everyone, Happy valentine's day

I am working with shading devices, creating "easy and understandable"
charts in order to allow people to choose one or the other. My idea is to
plot light (or solar) transmission, using the concept of BSDF.

I think Klems basis does not have the resolution I am looking for.
Accordingly, I thought on creating a Klems MF:2, MF:4, etc. basis, but that
might take too long.

Finally, I am evaluating on using genBSDF by analyzing only the center of
the patches (i.e. sending only parallel rays) and interpolating, in order
to get a smoother and better representation.

I know Greg worked with this and that it is a really non-straightforward
problem, so I wanted to know if there is any program that helps with
this... and also I would like to know if I am thinking this correctly.

AS ALWAYS, THANKS IN ADVANCE.

By the way, my idea would be to:

1.- genBSDF the BSDF of a product (klems basis, maybe Klems MF:N)
2.- from that matrix, interpolate and generate plots.

I will also have to deal with the loss of energy due to sharp light
sources...? That is something that I do not understand yet.

THANKS AGAIN, any comments welcome.

Hi German,

there will be no light loss. However interpolation does not increase resolution. Think of it as if you were taking a picture with a smartphone from the 90's - the overall average luminance may be correct, but you will never be able to add information on detail in between the pixels by interpolation. So if you want / need high resolution, run genBSDF accordingly.

Cheers, Lars.

Hi Lars, Thanks a lot for the quick answer, but I think my question was not
really clear.

What I want to achieve is to get the directional transmitance from" any"
angle. Interpolating  would allow me getting a continuous (although not
really exact) value. This is mainly for visualization purposes, not really
for getting exact values. By increasing the number of patches I would have
a better resolution, but still I would have "bins" and not a continuous
value.

I hope is clear. If it is too hard (i.e. there is not any program that does
it for me), I can just increase the number of bins, and just smooth the
final image.

Thanks a lot!

Germ?n

Hi Germ?n,

Why not use a tensor tree output of genBSDF in this case?  High resolution on incoming and outgoing angles where it matters is why it was developed.  You can use the C routines to query the TT directly, or use bsdf2rad to generate a Radiance model for visualization.

Cheers,
-Greg

Subject: [Radiance-general] rpict -dv option to switch light source
	visibility
Message-ID: <CAD7gt0UD_foJ1H0KwVvxkNRkawqZ1dWyokb_8YDgR1is42ztUA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I tried to make light source invisible by using the -dv option in rpict,
but somehow it doesn't work for me. The lights are shown black.

In my case, the camera and lights are placed at the same height in a room,
and the camera is looking down towards the floor. I have tried both with
and without -dv option.

When I place camera just below the lights, then the lights are not visible
(which is obvious, as lights are then not in line of sight).

Has someone else also experienced the same? Thank you!

Best regards,
Vaib

Hello Greg, and thanks for your answer.

 I did not know of the existence of bsdf2rad, I will try it soon... also, I
think I will forget about interpolating, haha.

Is it possible to integrate the outgoing radiation with TT???  My idea is
to just plot DIRECTIONAL transmittance, so people can choose one or another
shading device for their designs. I want to explore the posibility of
overlaying these plots with a solar plot of a certain location, and choose
a device that blocks the Solar Heat Gains when needed.

THANKS A LOT

I think the -dv switch works as designed. It will not hide the light source
completely but the source itself is shown in black instead of the actual
brightness that the object (lamp, light fitting etc) would have. I think
that was done to avoid high intensity peaks that would confuse certain
evaluation algorithms in other applications.

In your case you should be able to hide the light sources using a clipping
plane. Check the -vo option of rpict.

Regards,
Thomas

Hi Vaib,

You could also try using an "illum" in place of a "light."

Hi Germ?n,

You can compute the total hemispherical transmittance for a particular incident angle using the bsdf library, which is also reported to the standard error by bsdf2rad when you run it.

Best,
-Greg

Message-ID: <B7E6424E7BA25A49855CFB6E30349C2F61E8D225@ex-mbx-pro-02>

Hi Greg, Vaib and all,



About my question, I asked earlier, here are more details about the problem.

I am doing daylight analysis for a room using Radiance with output showed in Ecotect, I have the drawing with all required details ( the latitude, longitude, weather data, time, date and surface materials and colour) I already did calculate all the illuminance points at 0.8m on the grid created in Ecotect and got the result I need. Know I need to calculate the vertical illuminance for similar point I have in the grid that just facing the window opening as I need these readings to calculate the glare index for room I am studying it.

The problem that I am no that expert in using radiance, so is there any simple tips can help me in solve this problem?



I do appreciate your help in this matter



Many thanks and best regards,



Hana

Hi Hana,

If I understood your question correctly, you need to calculate illuminance
on a vertical grid in Ecotect. I guess you have already calculated
illuminance on a horizontal grid at 0.8m height above ground (working
plane). If this is correct, then please see the image attached.

I also started with Ecotect, but I am not sure it has its own user group.
But in this group too, there will be people who are experts in Ecotect.
Hope it helps.

Regards,
Vaib

Wow, that is exactly what I was looking for. I will modify bsdf2rad in
order to get the Hemispherical transmittance (or reflectance) as the stdout.

So I should do, for every pixel?s incident Theta and Phi I want, the
following:

*bsdf2rad  -t  TT_bsdf.xml in_Theta in_Phi 2>
hemispherical_transmission.txt*

Thanks, Greg, as usual.

Germ?n

Greg

I am sure there must be something simple I am missing but do you know why I would get significantly lower hemispherical transmittance figures from bsdf2rad than from BSDFviewer (e.g. for phi 0 theta 0 in bsdf2rad as compared to  incident patch 1 in BSDFviewer)?

Kind regards

No, I have no idea why they should disagree.  Maybe Andy has time to compare his code to the hemispherical scattering report I'm making in bsdf2rad:

			fprintf(stderr, "Hemispherical %s: %.3f\n",
				(output_orient > 0 ? "reflection" : "transmission"),
				SDdirectHemi(idir, SDsampSp|SDsampDf |
						(output_orient > 0 ?
						 SDsampR : SDsampT), &myBSDF));

It's possible that Andy isn't using the same set of flags, and is missing some of the energy or counting both sides rather than just hemispherical transmission.

Cheers,
-Greg

Subject: [Radiance-general] Modeling a flat-screen monitor
Message-ID: <CAJR73tshh3gsecTYzeUZ+d3xb9Ppz--Yb53j2__UHL_D3xmhvg@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to model a computer screen for glare analysis in Radiance.  I
have measured luminance values for the monitor showing white and black
screens in a dark room, as well as spectrophotometer reflectance data on
the screen while off.  Currently, I'm modeling it using a generic glass
material in front of a glow material, but this creates a lot of specular
reflection in rpict renderings that doesn't match up with observations.
 Does anyone have suggestions for creating more accurate Radiance materials
to model the monitor?

Thanks,

Hi David,

I'm getting near perfect agreement between the two programs.
Make sure you understand the front/back conventions for bsdf2rad:

This gives *back transmission* for the normal patch:
bsdf2rad -t mybsdf.xml 0 0 > myrad.rad

This gives *back reflection* for the normal patch:
bsdf2rad -p mybsdf.xml 0 0 > myrad.rad

This gives *front transmission* for the normal patch:
bsdf2rad -p mybsdf.xml 180 0 > myrad.rad

This gives *front reflection* for the normal patch:
bsdf2rad -t mybsdf.xml 180 0 > myrad.rad

And yes, when your theta is greater than 90 (to get front values) the
current behavior is that -t  gives reflection and -p gives transmission
(not sure if this is expected!)

If you're still not getting agreement, send me your xml file in a separate
email.

Andy

Hi David,

I'm getting near perfect agreement between the two programs.
Make sure you understand the front/back conventions for bsdf2rad:

This gives *back transmission* for the normal patch:
bsdf2rad -t mybsdf.xml 0 0 > myrad.rad

This gives *back reflection* for the normal patch:
bsdf2rad -p mybsdf.xml 0 0 > myrad.rad

This gives *front transmission* for the normal patch:
bsdf2rad -p mybsdf.xml 180 0 > myrad.rad

This gives *front reflection* for the normal patch:
bsdf2rad -t mybsdf.xml 180 0 > myrad.rad

And yes, when your theta is greater than 90 (to get front values) the
current behavior is that -t  gives reflection and -p gives transmission
(not sure if this is expected!)

If you're still not getting agreement, send me your xml file in a separate
email.

Andy

Hello,

how could I generate some parallel light like sunlight?  Should I use
"source" identifier?

What if I want to generate a parallel light beam (emitting from a tube)? I
am thinking that use a tube and place a point or circular light in that
tube, but it may not be parallel emitting from the tube..

Hi Greg, Vaib and all,



About my question, I asked earlier, here are more details about the problem.

I am doing daylight analysis for a room using Radiance with output showed in Ecotect, I have the drawing with all required details ( the latitude, longitude, weather data, time, date and surface materials and colour) I already did calculate all the illuminance points at 0.8m on the grid created in Ecotect and got the result I need. Know I need to calculate the vertical illuminance for similar point I have in the grid that just facing the window opening as I need these readings to calculate the glare index for room I am studying it.

The problem that I am no that expert in using radiance, so is there any simple tips can help me in solve this problem?



I do appreciate your help in this matter



Many thanks and best regards,



Hana

Hi Hana,

If I understood your question correctly, you need to calculate illuminance
on a vertical grid in Ecotect. I guess you have already calculated
illuminance on a horizontal grid at 0.8m height above ground (working
plane). If this is correct, then please see the image attached.

I also started with Ecotect, but I am not sure it has its own user group.
But in this group too, there will be people who are experts in Ecotect.
Hope it helps.

Regards,
Vaib

Subject: [Radiance-general] incident ray angles
Message-ID: <CABzgtwpGCVEit5XmGZQOAR9ep87-0KpYohiHF_FEeSQRsjM3zg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have a sensor and the sensor has different readings according to angle
between incident ray and normal. Theoretically, this readings should be
[cos(theta)*value of incident rays] hitting the sensor point (theta = angle
between ray hitting the surface and sensor normal).  However,t our sensor
is not this  relationship and I have to adjust the simualtion results to
fit the actual sensor readings.


   - one of the methods I can think of is to get directions of all the
   incident rays hitting the sensor point and then calculate all the angles
   between incident rays and sensor normal, and adjust the radiance values
   before using rtrac to calculate the actual illuminance values.  Is that
   feasible?   I notice there is a "t" option in rtrace, but it will return
   all the rays, not just rays hitting the sensor points.
   - Radiance traces only 1 ray from the sensor points or sample a number
   of rays from sensor point? (my understaning was that rtrace first traces a
   number of rays to check DIRECT light source and get the results, and then
   traces a SINGLE ray following the sensor normal and then sampling more when
   hitting a surface? if in this case, how can I determine the anges of direct
   and indirect rays?)


Thanks,

jia

Hi Jia,

you should check the rsensor program - that was developed by Greg to do
exactly what you want. The manpage describes well how to define your sensor
file and how to use rsensor.

Hope this helps,
best,
David

Hi Jia,

It seems that you posted this question twice to the mailing list.

The main effect of a "parallel" source is that its intensity does not diminish with distance.  The closest you can come to a parallel local light source in Radiance is to use the "spotlight" material with a very long direction vector, indicating that the virtual source is far behind the emitting area.  

Spotlight
Spotlight is used for self-luminous surfaces having directed output. As well as radiance, the full cone angle (in degrees) and orientation (output direction) vector are given. The length of the orientation vector is the distance of the effective focus behind the source center (i.e., the focal length).
        mod spotlight id
        0
        0
        7 red green blue angle xdir ydir zdir

Something like:

void spotlight long_throw
0
0
7 1e5 1e5 1e5 1.0 0 0 -1000

long_throw ring spot
0
0
9
	0	0	3
	0	0	-1
	0	.1

The above will create a 1-degree spread spotlight with a 1000-meter focal length, meaning that the effective emitting position is 1000 meters behind the emitting surface (a 10cm disk in the ceiling in this case).  This should give you the effect you want, even if the sample rays to the source are not always parallel.

If your actual purpose instead is to generate perfectly sharp shadows, you can do this by shrinking the size of the emitting area (and increasing the RGB arguments of spotlight to compensate).

-Greg

Have you investigated the program "rsensor"?  It should be able to handle any distribution you like.

By default, the -I option of rtrace gives you a cosine-weighted irradiance value.  If you need to add a cut-off, you can compute -I in the apex of a black cone of the appropriate size.

Thank you for this.  I had the -t and -p options back to front (literally)!  When I use your settings for front transmission I now get perfect agreement.

Kind regards

And yes, when your theta is greater than 90 (to get front values) the current behavior is that -t  gives reflection and -p gives transmission (not sure if this is expected!)

If you're still not getting agreement, send me your xml file in a separate email.

It's possible that Andy isn't using the same set of flags, and is missing some of the energy or counting both sides rather than just hemispherical transmission.

Cheers,

Hi Greg and David,

That is great.  I looked at the man page of rsensor program, that is what I
need.  I have a few questions for which I am struggling.

   1.  you mentioned I still have to use a cone to cutoff light even if I
   define the sensitivity data files?  should I list all from 0-90 (row
   degree) in the row or just view angle range (e.g., from 0 - 54 deg in row)?
     does the program do some interpolation for angles are not defined in the
   sensor files?
   2. Our program was built based on Daysim, and use gen_dc to generate
   daylight coefficient and us ds_illum to calculate the sensor readings. The
   readings are cosine weighted, but it seems no way to integrate rsensor with
   ds_ill or .dc files. I understand the 3 or 5 phase DC methods is good to
   handle this. Since we already have the code from Daysim, it may be easy to
   directly integrate resensor with current Daysim generated .dc files? Do you
   have some suggestion?
   3. If we use three phase DC method, we have to generate the BSDF files,
    genBSDF +f +b will double the time, so for blinds in the south wall
   settings, I only need use deault (+b only, not +f), is tha right?  +b will
   generate Transmission From (Window 6 convention), is that right?

  Thank you very much,

Jia

Hi,

I looked at the genbsdf.pl.  It seems that genBSDF +f will generate the
Tranmission Front (defined in xml file) and genBSDF +b will generate
"Transmission Back" in xml.

 However, bsdf_m.c code prefers the "Transmission Front" data. So when
using genbsdf, is that a good pratice to add +f, which generate
"Transmission Front" that is preferred by Radiance?


if (!sdata)
return RC_FAIL;
* /**
* * Remember that front and back are reversed from WINDOW 6 orientations*
* * Favor their "Front" (incoming light) since that's more often valid*
 */
tfront = !strcasecmp(sdata, "Transmission Back");
if (!strcasecmp(sdata, "Transmission Front") ||
tfront & (sd->tf == NULL)) {
if (sd->tf != NULL)
SDfreeSpectralDF(sd->tf);
if ((sd->tf = SDnewSpectralDF(1)) == NULL)
return RC_MEMERR;
df = sd->tf;
} else if (!strcasecmp(sdata, "Reflection Front")) {
if (sd->rb != NULL) /* note back-front reversal */
SDfreeSpectralDF(sd->rb);
if ((sd->rb = SDnewSpectralDF(1)) == NULL)
return RC_MEMERR;
df = sd->rb;

Message-ID: <CABzgtwpFY0=mcbNJ7+_k7jX2YbC0RE7emkC2h6w9o8GEfQatUw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

There are 30 sensors in the space, each of which has sensor spatial
response file and use rsensor to calculate illuminance values.  If I use
three phase method to conduct annual simulation. My current method is to
use:  rsensor -h -vf view.vf . to generate the 10000 rays and use these
rays to calcualte V matrix.  in other words, I am using three phase method
to calculate 10000 sensor points. At the end, only a single sensor values
are calculated.   Is there any better way?

Thanks!

The default genBSDF +b option should work fine.  Radiance knows how to reverse directions on transmission if it has to, but the direction is usually out the window, so +b is what you want.

The reason the code favors the "Transmission Front" data is because some Window6 files contain "filler" information for the "Transmission Back" data that is unreliable.  If both are present, it is safer to use the "Front" data for that reason.  In the case of genBSDF, there is no concern, since it doesn't fake its output.

Best,
-Greg

The cone is an easy (but computationally wasteful) alternative to using rsensor if all you need is a cut-off.  There is no reason to use such a device with rsensor.

Since we already have the code from Daysim, it may be easy to directly integrate resensor with current Daysim generated .dc files? Do you have some suggestion?
I will leave this to the Daysim experts to answer.  Using rsensor with the 3-phase method is more likely to succeed as you point out.

Yes, that's correct.

Regarding your second question, the 10000 sensor samples are integrated to a single value, and this is the way it works.  You can of course change this with the rsensor -rd option, but your accuracy will suffer.  In the scheme of things, 10000 rays is not too big a number of samples if your scene has a lot going on.  Convergence of Monte Carlo approaches generally proceeds as 1/sqrt(N) for N samples.

Best,
-Greg

At the end, only a single sensor values are calculated.   Is there any better way?

Hi,

as you showed in your email, there was no view information in the image in the beginning (see getinfo output). Scaling the image down will not magically create that missing information.

If you know the vertical and horizontal view angles, you can add them to the image header. Radiance comes with a tool "vinfo", which allows you to edit the image header in the editor "vi". An example view line taken from an image I happen to have here is:

VIEW= -vtv -vp 0.412249 3.5 1.5 -vd 0.39426 -0.911112 -0.2 -vu 0 0 1 -vh 75 -vv 75 -vo 0 -va 0 -vs 0 -vl 0

So the syntax is what you know from writing view files. Of course, you must KNOW (not guess, copy, assume) the information on the view when manually editing it, otherwise this will result in entirely random results when you do glare evaluation using it.

Cheers, Lars.

Hello Jia,

The DAYSIMps addon to Daysim by Penn State, "Considers photosensor spatial  
sensitivity, location, aiming, control algorithm, and calibration." You  
can see on page 11 it works by using some '.sen' files that describe the  
sensor sensitivity, and there is a new sim_photosensor program in the  
Daysim toolchain to enable this. The 2013 workshop presentation by Richard  
Mistrick is probably of use.

Best,
Alstan

Hello  Nithya,

Just to add to this, you can specify the view inline with the evalglare  
command using the latest 1.11 version,
> -vtt -vv vertangle -vh horzangle
or by referencing a viewfile,
> -vf viewfile
If you are using a 180 degree fisheye lens for your image capture, your  
command might look like,

> evalglare -vta -vv 180 -vh 180 snewshdr.hdr

Best,
Alstan

Hi Nithya,

This belongs in the non-existent FAQ.  Did you run a search on evalglare in the mailing list?

The "getinfo -d" command only reports the dimensions, not the view.  If you run getinfo without the -d, you should see a line of the form:

VIEW= [various -v options]

If you don't, then that is your problem with evalglare.  Where did the picture originate?

Best,
-Greg

Hi Jia,

You can use the -c option in rcontrib to average the coefficients of the
10,000 rays.

The command would look something like this:
rsensor -rd 10000 (MoreArguments) . | rcontrib -c 10000 (MoreArguments)
model.oct > sensor.vmx

Thanks Andy!  I was thinking to calculate all the readings for 10,000 rays
and then adding them together, which is incorrect and computational
expensive.

Hi Andy,

There is an better way to generate .vmx for all 30 sensors together instead
of manually combining them one by one? Thanks,

Jia

Hi,

Ale,

You should take a look at the "understanding rtcontrib" tutorial, by Axel
Jacobs. It is available on the radiance-online.org/learn/tutorials section.

You use rtcontrib (now you use rcontrib, which I understand is basically
the same, but faster) for calculating the contributions of each patch on
the scene. Genskyvec or gendaymtx, on their part, will generate the actual
vectors that represent the sky, including the sun unless you tell them
otherwise.

Bye

Germ?n

Alejandro

You can look at the algorithm that Daysim uses to distribute the sun
between fixed positions (for example this presentation on slide 11:
http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/research/gsdsquare/Presentations/Radiance%20WS2009_DaysimInnovations_CReinhart.pdf).
 Note that the developers found that a small subdivision of the sky is not
sufficient to model sunlight and shadows in sufficient detail. Therefore
the approach to use separate steps for sun and sky contributions in
coefficient based daylighting.

Regards,
Thomas

Subject: [Radiance-general] BSDF orientation and implementation
Message-ID: <CBDA7B0F3FC5354F986B71977E204BEC20EDF9EF@EX-MBX01.burohappold.com>

Good morning Gurus!

I have worked through the 3- and 5-phase tutorials in hopes of being able to apply a BSDF to one of my projects. This project will be using micro-louver cellular structures imbedded within an IGU, in both skylights and vertical windows. I think I understand the general process, but wanted to ask a few questions before getting too far down the road...

The skylights and windows are all different sizes and the windows are in multiple orientations (of course). My understanding of the BSDF and seemingly from this mail (http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-November/008248.html), I should be able to calculate the BSDF once for my system. I was planning model the louvers as 1m by 1m, but run genBSDF with the -dim arguments smaller than this. Is this the correct approach? Ideally I would not calculate the BSDF for each orientation, assuming that micro-louver geometry does not change.

In my BSDF material definition, I would alter the up vector according to the surface being applied - the up vector matches the BSDF orientation (calculated in xy space) to the specific geometry's orientation (0 0 1 for a window). If the louver are rotated within the IGU assembly (rz -45) for a skylight, I can account for this with the up vector of 1 1 0 (surface normal is 0 0 1). This would hold true for rotation within the vertical apertures as well. Each different up vector would be a different BSDF material.

Lastly, if the glazing properties (VLT) are not defined yet, can I import the BSDF file into Window and create multiple options for IGU's with varying properties? It seems so from David Geisler-Moroder's presentation at the 2012 Workshop (http://radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2012-copenhagen/Day1/Geisler-Moroder/geisler-moroder_BSDF_tutorial_s.pdf). Certainly skylights and windows will have different VLT and it would again be nice to not be required to run genBSDF multiple times.

I am in the process of working through the steps on my own, but wanted to ask these questions while I'm waiting on genBSDF.


Any help is much appreciated, as always.

Hi Alejandro,

There's basic material on (pre-rtcontrib/neolithic) use of Radiance to predict daylight coefficients in 'Chapter 6' here:

http://climate-based-daylighting.com/doku.php?id=resources:thesis

Cheers
John

PS.  I ditched the 'Aimed Rays' approach about 10 years ago and now use ~900 "light" sources (i.e. solid angles) per Tregenza patch.  Probably overkill, but it's quick nonetheless.  The 'aimed rays' approach only really worked for clear glazing, whereas the many light sources per patch will handle diffusing and redirecting materials described by cal files.

Chris,
Everything you write seems correct. One whatch-it I can offer is to make
sure you're system is situated properly for the genBSDF run. +Z is into the
space, +Y is up.  All of the geometry should be in the -Z space. If you
don't follow these guidelines you're BSDF will be strange.

We are looking for motivated candidates for a 2-month student internship
in our interdisciplinary team to contribute to our project Daylight
Redirecting Components (http://p3.snf.ch/project-147053) and further our
development of in-house simulation software within the framework of the
RADIANCE rendering system.

As part of our research agenda, we plan to investigate the application of
Quasi-Monte-Carlo raytracing (including photon-mapping) for improved
convergence of our simulations. The intern is tasked with the development
and evaluation of a low-discrepancy series  generator as a drop-in
replacement for the standard random number generator used in the RADIANCE
software. The intern is expected to conduct preliminary research in the
field, be self-organised, and complete assigned tasks independently.

The candidate should have a background in mathematics and/or computer
science, and be knowledgeable in the following fields:
- Monte-Carlo techniques and statistics
- Raytracing, path tracing, photon mapping
In addition, familiarity with the RADIANCE rendering system and BSDF
representations is desirable.

Candidates can apply directly by replying to the address below and
forwarding their CV, list of related projects, recent transcript, and
motivational letter.

Hi Chris,

a short note from my side:
Yes, you can import BSDFs of systems into WINDOW and generate new BSDFs
including the glass panes of your IGU. Therefore my approach is usually to
simulate only the system without any glazing and put the overall system
together in WINDOW with the right glass.
Concerning the generation of BSDFs for various applications of a single
system you should decide if the kind of system you are simulating is
representative for your application. I tend to simulate typical periods of
a systems (e.g. for a lamella system you can use the -dim settings to get
that right) and model any frame in the geometric model. However, in cases
where e.g. the ratio of system thickness to system size dimension is quite
high and thus the frame will significantly influence the BSDF, it is better
to include the real geometry in the BSDF simulation model. However, you
then probably end up generating more than a single BSDF for the same system
depending on the applications.

I hope it's somehow clear... if not, let me know and I'll try again ;-)

Cheers,
David

Hi Chris,

What Andy said! To that end, I would add that tools like objview (for visualizing your CFS geometry) and bsdf2rad (for visualizing the BSDF distribution) are very useful for getting comfortable with your generated BSDFs. I am working on a little ?test room? model, a la the ltview script but for CFS instead of luminaries. When it?s sensible I?ll post some results. It?s very helpful to visualize these things; Andy?s BSDFviewer is awesome, but I also like to mock these things up in Radiance proper so I am certain the functions and the models are are being implemented and oriented correctly, you know what I mean?

Andy/David/Rob - Thanks for the encouragement and suggestions.

I've been working through trying to troubleshoot as I go along. Studying it in a 10m cube so I can easily understand how the light is being redistributed rather than in my full model. I also found that running the CFS through genBSDF with an all black material helpful to digest that specular transmission is occurring as expected.
Andy's reminder that +Z is "in" the space was helpful in making me understand why the Klems bsdf seemed backwards. Now my tensor tree bsdf seems backwards using the same geometry - which is unnerving. I'm reworking the process and will post updates, and inevitably more questions. I was finally able to get Andy's BSDF Viewer to compile in Ubuntu - it was much easier once I realized the network had been disabled and then resolved my proxy issues for the compiler's dependencies. I forgot about bsdf2rad, will look into it.

David, your note was clear. Thanks. My system is grid a 10mm cubes fit into skylights that are 4m x 8m or larger. I think the edge condition can be ignored in the BSDF calculation.


Thanks again all for help here and in the tutorials, presentations, code, etc. Once I can confirm my results are wrong and its not as much of a user error as it likely is, I'll post more info/questions.

Chris

Chris,
A few weeks ago somebody alerted me to a bug in BSDFViewer for tensor tree
BSDFs that flips the transmission front and back. So your tensor tree BSDF
is probably fine. My stupid utility has a bug.  I'll let you know when I've
fixed it and posted a new version.

Hi Nathaniel,

You should check out Niloofar Moghbel's Ph.D. dissertation at:

That's good to hear...I was just about to upload some images asking for clarification.


Follow-up to the 5-phase process:
I'm using a small CFS model to generate my BSDF, do I need to create an array with the actual geometry covering the full aperture for the Direct Sun Contribution (Cds)?

For rendering - It seems so, otherwise I don't see how the shadow rays are traced that get piped to rcontrib. model_nosuns.oct doesn't have the proxy surface, only physical geometry.
For calc points - Maybe? The model_suns.oct has both physical geometry and proxied geometry.


Although, when I try the as the tutorial states, I get a "rtrace: Broken Pipe" error. My tensor tree BSDF has an error for 110.9% rear reflection.
Just to verify that wasn't an issue, I doubled back to the files used in Andy's tutorial, I also get the error. Code run there was:
vwrays -c 4 -pj 1 -fa -vf views/back.vf -x 500 -y 500 | rtrace -h- -opn -faa -ab 0 octs/model_nosuns.oct | \
            rcontrib `vwrays -vf views/back.vf -x 500 -y 500 -d` -n 7 -fac -fo -o viewpics_ds/back_%04d.hdr \
            -e MF:6 -f reinhart.cal -b rbin -bn Nrbins -m solar -c 4 -I -ab 1 -ad 100 -dt 0 -dc 1 -lw 1e-2 octs/model_suns.oct
My standard build is the HEAD from 26SEP13, but also tried one from last week (2/21) with no success.


General question if 5-phase is unable to work without full geometry for the CFS, are we then limited to only systems that can be modeled (ie, no lenses, laser cut panels, etc)?

Sorry if I'm all over the place, I started writing this mail at 3p.

Chris,
A few weeks ago somebody alerted me to a bug in BSDFViewer for tensor tree BSDFs that flips the transmission front and back. So your tensor tree BSDF is probably fine. My stupid utility has a bug.  I'll let you know when I've fixed it and posted a new version.

Andy/David/Rob - Thanks for the encouragement and suggestions.

I've been working through trying to troubleshoot as I go along. Studying it in a 10m cube so I can easily understand how the light is being redistributed rather than in my full model. I also found that running the CFS through genBSDF with an all black material helpful to digest that specular transmission is occurring as expected.
Andy's reminder that +Z is "in" the space was helpful in making me understand why the Klems bsdf seemed backwards. Now my tensor tree bsdf seems backwards using the same geometry - which is unnerving. I'm reworking the process and will post updates, and inevitably more questions. I was finally able to get Andy's BSDF Viewer to compile in Ubuntu - it was much easier once I realized the network had been disabled and then resolved my proxy issues for the compiler's dependencies. I forgot about bsdf2rad, will look into it.

David, your note was clear. Thanks. My system is grid a 10mm cubes fit into skylights that are 4m x 8m or larger. I think the edge condition can be ignored in the BSDF calculation.


Thanks again all for help here and in the tutorials, presentations, code, etc. Once I can confirm my results are wrong and its not as much of a user error as it likely is, I'll post more info/questions.

Chris

Hi Chris,

What Andy said! To that end, I would add that tools like objview (for visualizing your CFS geometry) and bsdf2rad (for visualizing the BSDF distribution) are very useful for getting comfortable with your generated BSDFs. I am working on a little "test room" model, a la the ltview script but for CFS instead of luminaries. When it's sensible I'll post some results. It's very helpful to visualize these things; Andy's BSDFviewer is awesome, but I also like to mock these things up in Radiance proper so I am certain the functions and the models are are being implemented and oriented correctly, you know what I mean?

Subject: Re: [Radiance-general] BSDF orientation and implementation

Hi Chris,

a short note from my side:
Yes, you can import BSDFs of systems into WINDOW and generate new BSDFs including the glass panes of your IGU. Therefore my approach is usually to simulate only the system without any glazing and put the overall system together in WINDOW with the right glass.
Concerning the generation of BSDFs for various applications of a single system you should decide if the kind of system you are simulating is representative for your application. I tend to simulate typical periods of a systems (e.g. for a lamella system you can use the -dim settings to get that right) and model any frame in the geometric model. However, in cases where e.g. the ratio of system thickness to system size dimension is quite high and thus the frame will significantly influence the BSDF, it is better to include the real geometry in the BSDF simulation model. However, you then probably end up generating more than a single BSDF for the same system depending on the applications.

I hope it's somehow clear... if not, let me know and I'll try again ;-)

Cheers,
David

Chris,
Everything you write seems correct. One whatch-it I can offer is to make sure you're system is situated properly for the genBSDF run. +Z is into the space, +Y is up.  All of the geometry should be in the -Z space. If you don't follow these guidelines you're BSDF will be strange.

The skylights and windows are all different sizes and the windows are in multiple orientations (of course).

Certainly skylights and windows will have different VLT and it would again be nice to not be required to run genBSDF multiple times.

I am in the process of working through the steps on my own, but wanted to ask these questions while I'm waiting on genBSDF.


Any help is much appreciated, as always.
