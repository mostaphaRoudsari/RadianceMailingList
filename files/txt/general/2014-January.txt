Subject: [Radiance-general] gendaymtx program is missing
Message-ID: <CAD83LVJE8daJNWsPziLDinTiTtOe1MPyc8qv1Cndhn8FHXG+=A@mail.gmail.com>

Dear List,

I can't find the *gendaymtx* program when searching by "$ which gendaymtx".

Its man page is on Radiance site so I assume it's included in the Radiance
standard distribution I installed on Mac. Or should I download and install
it from somewhere else?

Advices are greatly appreciated!

Gendaymtx is a new program written since the last official release.  You can download it with the latest HEAD builds from:

Hello!

I just wish to confirm about the Site Standard Meridian (-m) argument for
genrsky. Is it the following:

Local longitude of Standard Time Meridian (LSTM):
LSTM = 15 deg x (Longitude/15 deg)round to integer


Best regards,

What you are describing is a special case that is true for most, but not 
all, time zones.

Most time zones in Radiance notation are given in multiples of 15 
degrees.  Exceptions to this are the countries marked on this map
http://www.icsm.gov.au/mapping/images/time_zones.jpg
with a star.

Countries that have a TZ of GMT +/- X.5 hrs or -(X*15) + 7.5 deg include:
- India
- a bit of Australia
- Iran
(there are more...)

Finally, there is Nepal which is at GMT +5:45 hrs or -5.75*15 = -86.25 
deg in Radiance notation.

In other words: the 'round to integer' part of your equation is correct 
in most, but not all, cases.  You might end up with a floating point 
number if your project is located in exotic places.

FYI: This integer bug existed in epw2wea which just recently made it 
into Radiance HEAD. It was fixed just before Christmas.

Regards

Axel

A Wikimedia map with detailed annotation. Political boundaries are probably much more important than the geographic longitude value. A very high proportion of countries span multiple 15 degree longitude zones. In nearly all countries, cities near certain borders might round off to a different time zone by geographic location, but are grouped into the country's primary time zone by political boundaries.

I agree with Chris, you're better off looking up the time zone and setting
-m accordingly. The equation you propose will give the wrong meridian for
many cities. For example: Indianapolis, Knoxville, Boise, all of Spain and
 almost all of France.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Using radiance for simulating light pipes
Message-ID: <DUB117-W34A51482FDC0CDA49CD51BCAB60@phx.gbl>

Hi everyone, 
I am a newcomer in the radiance community. I am involved in a project to assess the light output from light pipes. We are gonna simulate the light output of 2 types of light pipes and then compared them to the on site measurements. I would appreciate any guiding or advise on where to start the simulations. I am considering backward retracing as a more suitable option than forward retracing for this particular case, what do you think?
Thank you
Ale

Hi Alejandro,

the topic of light pipes appears from time to time, and unfortunately
the simple answer is that Radiance (and any backwards-tracer) is not
really suiteable for the task, if

1) you consider sunny days (you probably want to do so)

2) you do not have a diffusor placed on the top aperture of the pipe.

There are still some promising approaches to solve the problem. One is
using descrete patch models of the sky, such as the Tregenza scheme,
with the direct sun contribution being distributed over larger patches.
This implies distributing the sun radiance over a larger part of the
sky, which smoothes out sharp peaks in the transmission - which may not
be crucial in many cases.

The other option is using a forward extension to Radiance, such as the
photon map. This requires a modified version of Radiance, but gives you
a tool which has been developed with exactly applications such as light
pipes in mind.

Finally, you may even try to generate the BSDF of a light pipe using
genBSDF and apply this to a surface representing the bottom aperture.

The latter two options keep the resolution of the incident radiance,
especially the "sharpness" from the sun, intact.

Cheers, Lars.

What Lars said, and:

Most TDD manufacturers provide performance tables based on some incident illumination on the exterior aperture, relating that flux to an expected avg illuminance inside a model space, assuming some room cavity ratio and TDD spacing. People have been known to use those tables, and an annual exterior (e.g. roof) illuminance schedule (ideally based on a weather file and Perez sky) to scale the predicted interior illuminance for an annual (or whatever) result. In this way you could use a light backwards ray tracer because you?re just solving the problem from the roof to the sky/sun. This whole process would be super fast with Lars? recommended approach to deriving the annual illuminance schedule (i.e. using gendaymtx and a single point on the roof). This approach also takes into account local obstructions (rooftop units, trees, whatever). 

Several TDD manufacturers also provide photometry files that you could use in Radiance to compute a grid of interior point illuminances, and again scale those up or down based on the roof illuminance schedule. In this way you could do a fairly reasonable accounting of an actual interior. 

The performance tables and photometry files are all a bit nebulous, based on assumptions and best/worst case scenarios, and voodoo. Your mileage may vary. Proceed with caution. Look both ways before crossing the street. But hey, it?s something. =8-)

This approach also takes into account local obstructions (rooftop units, trees, whatever).

Hello all,

 

I found the BRTDfunc in the reference manual off Radiance, but I don't
understand fully how this function is working

 

I have a glass whit a transmittance of 0,8 and an reflectance of 0,08

 

I was thinking to do link this

 

void       BRTDfunc            testing_glass

10

                0.08                       0.08                       0.08
[I was thinking this is the reflection]

                0.87154                0.87154                0.87154

Hi Sierd,

if all you need to model is a clear glass pane, do not use BRTDfunc but glass. That is an optimized modifier modeling transmission and reflection for thin glass panes surrounded by air (which is a function of the direction a ray is passing through).

BRTDfunc is meant to describe transmission and reflection using the mathematical description language of Radiance (see the cal-files coming in the library). It does not make sense to use it without any mathematical model.

Cheers, Lars.

Hi Lars,

Thanks for your responding my question. I have used the glass function but I
can only chance the transmission of this pane and not the reflection. In my
project is the reflection of this pane very important and I was thinking the
BRTDfunc will help me whit this. So for  that I have found the glazing.cal
file in the library to calculate my glas but is ther also an explanation of
these calculations

cheers, Sierd.

What is your method for determining the transmission and reflectance of the glass? Are you familiar with the Optics software and the international glazing database? There is also an interactive script "glaze" that allows you to define multi-pane glazing and some basic coatings.

Hi,

I would say that I have an adequate understanding of radiance.  I am capable of producing renderings and performing glare analyses.  I have been asked to produce a falsecolor illuminance rendering.  I have the latest version of radiance installed and I see that there is a falsecolor program but I am not sure how to use it as it is not a recognized command.  I have been told I need perl to operate the falsecolor program.  What exactly is perl? Where do I download it and how do I install it?  Once installed, to execute the falsecolor function same as calling it out in the command prompt like rpict and ies2rad? I was given this task today and need to produce this by the end of tomorrow. Any help provided would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you,
Kyle

Hi Kyle,

Yes, the latest version of falsecolor is a Perl script, requiring Perl to be installed on your system. A couple of questions:

1. what operating system are you using? I?m guessing Windows, since Mac and Linux OSes ship with Perl. Regardless, here?s where you can get info on getting Perl:

http://www.perl.org/get.html

2. Are you sure you want an illuminance rendering? If so, you need to pass the ?-i? (that?s a lowercase ?I?) option to rtrace to get an irradiance image.

As always, the man page is the best source for usage info:

Hi Kyle,

Thanks to Thomas Bleicher, you can also use falsecolor2 and wxfalsecolor as
an alternative:

Thanks Mostapha, I forgot about that. Be advised, that's a Python script, so you're out of one interpreter/frying pan, and into another one, so to speak. =8-)

Hi Kyle,

Thanks to Thomas Bleicher, you can also use falsecolor2 and wxfalsecolor as an alternative: https://sites.google.com/site/tbleicher/radiance/wxfalsecolor

Hi Kyle,

Yes, the latest version of falsecolor is a Perl script, requiring Perl to be installed on your system. A couple of questions:

1. what operating system are you using? I'm guessing Windows, since Mac and Linux OSes ship with Perl. Regardless, here's where you can get info on getting Perl:

http://www.perl.org/get.html

2. Are you sure you want an illuminance rendering? If so, you need to pass the "-i" (that's a lowercase "I") option to rtrace to get an irradiance image.

As always, the man page is the best source for usage info:

Hi,

I would say that I have an adequate understanding of radiance.  I am capable of producing renderings and performing glare analyses.  I have been asked to produce a falsecolor illuminance rendering.  I have the latest version of radiance installed and I see that there is a falsecolor program but I am not sure how to use it as it is not a recognized command.  I have been told I need perl to operate the falsecolor program.  What exactly is perl? Where do I download it and how do I install it?  Once installed, to execute the falsecolor function same as calling it out in the command prompt like rpict and ies2rad? I was given this task today and need to produce this by the end of tomorrow. Any help provided would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you,
Kyle

Hi Rob, Thank you for the explanation. You are right however Thomas also
provided the compiled .exe files for Windows that helps the user not to

Hi Sierd,

as Christopher wrote in his mail, you should consider Optics as a 
starting point if you have a e.g. coated glazing. Whatever you do, 
reflection and transmission should be a function of the incident 
direction for clear glazings. One other approach may be the trans 
material, which allows to define reflection and transmission at normal 
incidence. The angular dependance will follow a Fresnel-term if you stay 
with only clear transmission and reflection, roughness=0. This may be 
what you want?

Peter did a very nice comparision on the various models available in 
Radiance:

http://arxiv.org/pdf/1307.4214.pdf

Cheers, Lars.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Regarding Radiance Installation, Qt-based rvu,
	and Objline issues
Message-ID: <CAD7gt0WUiBOK_daP71J4--7=bzChQ4PDfwmmVObCN_VxHGZ8oQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone, Hello Rob,

I just uninstalled the standard Radiance package I had on my Linux (Debian
Wheezy) machine. This packaged was installed by the standard Add/Remove
Software utility in Debian. Then I downloaded
"radiance-4.2.a-Linux.tar32.gz" from the NREL's website and copied it's
"radiance" folder at /usr/local/. Then I added the RAYPATH in the .bashrc
file as per the instructions given on the website. I tried to check the
installation by running gensky command, and it works fine. But I have
observed some issues with "rvu -o qt" and "objline" :

1. "$ rvu -o qt myScene.oct" gives me this error: rvu:
/lib/i386-linux-gnu/i686/cmov/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.15' not found
(required by rvu)

AND

2. "$ objline myScene.rad | x11meta" gives me this error: fatal - cannot
open file "/usr/local/lib/meta/vchars.mta", mode "r"

In the previous standard installation of Radiance, "$ objline myScene.rad |
x11meta" use to work fine. Do you know what has happened now? and, have I
re-installed radiance properly? Thank you!

Regards,
Vaib

Sorry, the second error is not from objline, I meant x11meta there.
Correction.

Does anyone know of a way to get vertical illuminance at a specific point in Radiance?

Thanks,

Hi,

You can give the direction vector in rtrace command to get irradiance
value. Check rtrace manual.
For example: If you assign input arguments "xorg yorg zorg xdir ydir zdir"
as "xorg yorg zorg 0 0 1" then you will get irradiance at the horizontal
plane (or floor of the building). Similarly, you can do for other vertical
planes by assigning their correct location and direction. To convert
irradiance to illuminance, see this command:

$ echo xorg yorg zorg xdir ydir zdir | rtrace -I [options] yourScene.oct |
rcalc -e ?$1=$2;$2=179*(.265*$4+.670*$5+.065*$6)?

Regards,
Vaib

The version of glibc NREL's release was built against is newer than the 
one which comes with Debian Wheezy.  A procedure for installing a newer 
glibc is given here:

It looks to me like x11meta expects files at /usr/local/lib which 
haven't been copied there.  Check and see if that's the case.

Thanks Randolph. Can you tell me if that glibc version is unduly recent? Meanwhile I can double check that the x11meta stuff is not my fault either.

Thanks Randolph.

Is there any documentation to properly install Radiance (latest one from
NREL) ? Or if you can give some hint, because I couldn't find any such
discussion on the web. Or my installation process mentioned in the trailing
is good enough. Thanks!

Debian Wheezy is the current "stable" release.  It was released just 
last December and contains glibc 2.13.  So, off the top of my head--and 
Bernd might have a different opinion--I would say that if possible it 
would probably be best to make the binaries work with the stable 
version of Debian.

I think once you patch up your install, that will work.

There really isn't much current documentation.  Me, I'd be inclined to 
get the current cvs version from radiance-online.org and follow the 
instructions in the README, but that's a bit much if you aren't a 
software dinosaur like me.  I think one could probably create a Debian 
source package without too much trouble, since most of that work is 
already done, but I'm not sure of the procedures.

I also looked before for configure and README files, but couldn't find them
in "radiance-4.2.a-Linux.tar32.gz". May be I will look again..

(probably belongs on -dev, cross-posting to -general since this thread started there)

The general idea with the Linux Radiance package NREL distributes was simply to provide a tarball of the executables and library files. It's not intended to be an "installer". The thought was that if people are using Linux they probably could unpack a tarball to a proper destination and make the environment mods mentioned in any number of howtos. 

That said, it would be great to offer more than that. We are working on a Chef recipe, in support of our OpenStudio-Radiance-on-the-cloud effort (!), which will be one way to easily bootstrap a Radiance box. CMake can also make an "install script package" of the Linux Radiance binaries, which is simply the tarball with a little sh wrapper that does the unarchiving. We used to post those to the OpenStudio website but I didn't think anyone was using them and they are still a big hack compared to Bernd's .deb, or our Chef script. Each of these have their own issues: the former is tied to major releases, and the latter is designed for headless installations. 

I have a list of things I'd like to do in the near future:
- add files Greg added to src/util this week to CMake build system
- support incremental versions somehow (may be totally independent of the CVS, it'd just be nice to tie our installers to a HEAD vintage for general housekeeping purposes (and Chef kinda needs this))
- add a CMAKE_BUILD_HEADLESS target (this is also for Chef support but could help others)
- dial in the linking on all packages to maximize backward compatibility; this seems to be the biggest problem with Linux.  
- get some reasonably reliable CMake build/test scripts together (I have some, but I'd like to make them more general so we could share them with the community)
- (really) offer incremental HEAD releases, perhaps timed to coincide with NREL's OpenStudio iteration build releases every two weeks. 

If anyone has feedback or requests to go along with this list, let me know. I plan to cross all of these off by the end of February. 

- Rob

Hello everyone, Hello Rob,

I just uninstalled the standard Radiance package I had on my Linux (Debian
Wheezy) machine. This packaged was installed by the standard Add/Remove Software utility in Debian. Then I downloaded "radiance-4.2.a-Linux.tar32.gz" from the NREL's website and copied it's "radiance" folder at /usr/local/. Then I added the RAYPATH in the .bashrc file as per the instructions given on the website. I tried to check the installation by running gensky command, and it works fine. But I have observed some issues with "rvu -o qt" and "objline" :

1. "$ rvu -o qt myScene.oct" gives me this error: rvu:
/lib/i386-linux-gnu/i686/cmov/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.15' not found (required by rvu)

AND

2. "$ objline myScene.rad | x11meta" gives me this error: fatal - cannot open file "/usr/local/lib/meta/vchars.mta", mode "r"

In the previous standard installation of Radiance, "$ objline myScene.rad | x11meta" use to work fine. Do you know what has happened now? and, have I re-installed radiance properly? Thank you!

Regards,
Vaib

Sorry, the second error is not from objline, I meant x11meta there.
Correction.

Hi all,

Does anyone know of a way to get vertical illuminance at a specific point in Radiance?

Thanks,

Hana

Hi,

You can give the direction vector in rtrace command to get irradiance value. Check rtrace manual.
For example: If you assign input arguments "xorg yorg zorg xdir ydir zdir"
as "xorg yorg zorg 0 0 1" then you will get irradiance at the horizontal plane (or floor of the building). Similarly, you can do for other vertical planes by assigning their correct location and direction. To convert irradiance to illuminance, see this command:

$ echo xorg yorg zorg xdir ydir zdir | rtrace -I [options] yourScene.oct | rcalc -e ?$1=$2;$2=179*(.265*$4+.670*$5+.065*$6)?

Regards,
Vaib

Is it possible to calculate cumulative daily lux by month with radiance?

Hi,
Sorry, for the interrubtion. 
On radiance-online.org, you are quoting the formula
tn = (sqrt(.8402528435+.0072522239*Tn*Tn)-.9166530661)/.0036261119/Tn
to get from transmission to transmissivity; 
Can you tell me the source of that formula?
Is there an ISO standard to calculate this?

Also, you say, there is a software called window, to calculate the transmissivity properly for double glazed panes.
Can you provide a link to that software.

I am teaching Energy Design for architects in Vienna and would like to provide the students with some proper information.

Thanks a lot
Bernhard Sommer

Hi Bernhard,

This formula comes from the more general formula you can compute from the normal transmittance and index of refraction.  If you look in ray/src/cal/cal, you will find the file "trans.cal" that contains the more complete definition.  The numbers you quoted are the simplification of the equations with the index of refraction (n) set to 1.52, a typical value for glass.

The formula itself was derived from Fresnel's equations and the infinite series solution for float glass.  You can trust me on that or re-derive it yourself, as I don't have the derivation handy.  I don't know if there is an ISO standard where you can look it up.

For double-paned glazing, there are some good approximations built into the glaze script, which is distributed with Radiance.  It does not provide formulas, however.  The DOE Window program is available from:

	http://windows.lbl.gov/software/window/6/W63_faq.html

Best,
-Greg

Yes.

If you want more details, you'll have to ask a more detailed question, describing your input (do you have a weather tape?) and how you want to average or accumulate your data (any operable systems in play?), etc.

Dear Greg

I hope you don't mind me contacting you - i'm a lecturer and researcher at De Montfort University, working on an exciting HDR project with Birgit Painter. Birgit has told me a lot about the work that she did with Denis Fan and John Mardaljevic.

The current project involves using a Raspberry Pi to capture bracketed shots and I would love to be able to code Radiance onto it. I saw a post on radiance-online (regarding Beagle Bone), and therefore wondered if a compatible version of the code was now available for a Raspberry Pi please? I have trawled the internet and not as yet found a suitable version.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards
 
Marie

Hello Marie,

You actually wrote to the Radiance mailing list, not me directly.  It's just as well, though, since I'm not aware if anyone has ported Radiance to the Raspberry Pi.  If anyone on the mailing list has worked on this or has some helpful information, I hope they will respond.

There were some folks working on a RP port of hdrgen, which I think they got working.  Perhaps this would be useful to your project as well?

Best,
-Greg

Dear Marie,

the raspberry pi is just a Linux system with limited resources. If you have a Debian system installed,

sudo apt-get install radiance

should be all you need to install Radiance, given a working Internet connection or installation media.

There used to be a define to reduce memory requirements by using single precision floats when compiling Radiance, but probably no one used that for decades.

All in all, using the image processing tools may make sense, but I would not spend my time trying to get complete renderings from such hardware :)

Cheers, Lars.

The Raspberry Pi build of hdrgen worked. And Radiance on the Pi works
as well. Note that rpict on the Pi runs about as fast as you'd expect
from a $30 computer---it finishes my benchmark test in 1021 minutes,
while a 4-core i7 can do it in parallel in 4 minutes.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Creating a void in a wall
Message-ID: <CAJeoGJ6_nrbJYohRO0KpAjhMFaCqreD27Eq9yPFd0NzkgLhOSQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

Is it possible to create a void in a wall instead of creating polygons
around a void?

For instance:
for creating a window we can generate polygons surrounding the window and
then a polygon which refers to glass. now I want to know instead of doing
that is it possible to define a wall as a polygon and create a window on
the wall without manipulating the wall's polygon.

It might have a simple solution.

Best Regards,

Ehsan

Hi Ehsan,

nothing is impossible with Radiance ;) You can get a hole into your wall without modifying the underlying geometry of the wall polygon. One way is to cut out the opening with a box of material antimatter. Everything within that box will become invisible. This means that you can also not place window frame and glass inside. The second option is to apply a mixfunc modifier to your wall. At locations defined by a simple function, the material will be "air" (e.g. void, or trans with pure specular transmission), everything else will be your wall material.

But: you likely introduce later problems when modeling that way. Once that you have overlaps of your invisible, but still existing wall polygon with other geometry (window pane, bsdf or illum, ..) you will get strang results which are hard to debug. I would not recommend this for a simple wall. There are cases where this may make sense, though - e.g. if you want to cut a hole into a sphere, you can either use antimatter or mixfunc into a sphere primitive with few lines of Radiance scene description, or you have to mesh the hole sphere object... possibly leading to a megabyte of triangles...

Cheers, Lars.

Thanks for your early respond Lars.

If I understand correctly to create a window within the wall I need to use
a mixfunc, because using antimatter will make everything invisible, right?

Cheers, Ehsan

Message-ID: <CAAzVHq0AMYoHV5oE9L4vV7ePkBH6tA7-UfBLVuD1Gfq4VoYDRA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list,

I plan to build several radiance models of Alzheimer care facilities in
preparation for a field study examining daylight exposures and cognitive /
health outcomes in partnership with a colleague in health sciences.

The radiance work is intended to supplement the data collected from
physical sensors to provide greater insight into 24-hour patters of light /
dark.

I would like to measure the surface optical properties (color,
reflectance) of the walls / ceilings and floors etc.

I am aware of two devices that have been used to do this.

1) The first is the X-rite Colormunki (actual name of product) that Michael
Donn was using while visiting LBNL.

The second is the Minolta CM-2002 Spectrophotometer used by Mehlika Inanici.
http://faculty.washington.edu/inanici/Publications/mi-luekos2010.pdf

If anyone has experience with this task who can provide some comments on
their approach it would be appreciated. (Michael and Mehlika, i will likely
contact you directly!).

Best,

-Kyle

I ASSume you are happy with simple spectral info (RGB) for your Radiance model? If so you could do this on the cheap and easy with a MacBeth color chart and the macbethcal utility in Radiance. Just sayin'.

P.S. I know we're all lighting peeps, but recent research suggests the way to avoid Alzheimer's is cholesterol. Brain by bacon!
P.P.S. I may have oversimplified the current research, a tad.

If you use antimatter, you will need to create a box that cuts through the wall to make an opening, creating more geometry than simply making an opening in the wall in the first place.

Using mixfunc, you can alternate materials in the wall, but if the wall has thickness, you will end up seeing "into" the wall this way, unless you also insert some sill geometry.  Again, it ends up being easier to create the opening for a thick wall.

Best,
-Greg

Hi Kyle,

I have used the CM-2002.  It's expensive, but works well.  Photographing a Macbeth color chart next to your surface as Rob suggests also works if it's diffuse and your lighting is uniform.  These are difficult things to guarantee in practice.

I haven't use the Colormunki, so I don't know anything about that.  I wrote a somewhat out-of-date document that covers some of these methods:

Best of luck!

Kyle,

Minolta CM-2002 Spectrophotometer works well to measure color and reflectance but it is rather an expensive equipment (even just for lease). Last time I used it, I compared the measurement values with the results I achieved using Macbeth chart and macbethcal (http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/man_html/macbethcal.1.html) and the results were very close.

As Greg mentioned, the photographs of the sample and Macbeth chart should be taken under stable and uniform lighting conditions.

thank you,

finally, I ended up with creating an opening by generating surrounding

I've used the Minolta with good results. It's worth speaking to your
local rep and asking about a loan of the equipment; they will have a
sales model which you might be able to borrow for a few days. I've
done this in the past with other (horribly expensive) Minolta
equipment.

You can also use a Macbeth, as Robert says. With a good camera, good
lighting, careful photography, and careful processing you can expect
about a 4 dE average error, in my experience. This is not good enough
for applications like paint matching, where you really need to be
under 1, but may be OK for what you need.

I have some software for calibrating off a Macbeth as well, it might
be easier to use than the macbethcal utility.

Subject: [Radiance-general] confused by turbidity
Message-ID: <52EA3990.7080400@st-andrews.ac.uk>

Hi Everyone,

I've been hacking around with some code trying to see how turbidity 
changes my rendering, so far I can't see to find any change in my 
images. Which leads me to suppose that I must be doing something wrong. 
I'm using the commands in *Bold* which result in the world.rad files below.


Another question.

I'm actually interested in simulating turbidity underwater, don't know 
if anyone can comment upon whether the turbidity numbers for air relate 
to those for water? Is there a better renderer for such things.

Best wishes,

George

Hi George,

gensky makes use of the standard sky distributions overcast (cloudy), clear (sunny) plus intermediate. The distributions are thus given, not affected by a turbidity. The turbidity value would be used to "scale" the distributions if you rely on the model-based assumptions instead of using measured / otherwise expected illuminance or luminance, but not when you pass that value using the -B parameter. Thus, in your case, you get a sunny sky and the turbidity is simply ignored. If you skip the -B parameter, then the sky luminance will be scaled based on the models included in gensky, and these would make use of the turbidity parameter. You can check this by varying -t and removing -B 55.87.

Cheers, Lars.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Visibility of computer screens in rooms with
	daylight?
Message-ID: <CADq2N7NNVS0nJf=4cNsu5atTSRVTJci1S8jnteepnVDf--rJjA@mail.gmail.com>

 Hello list,
I have a small request, or question that I hope you can help me answer, or
guide me to some literature on the topic.
I'll try to do it short ;-)
I'm currently working on a project were we are designing a new head quarter
for a bank in Copenhagen. In this bank there is a huge trading floor, which
is located under an atrium roof! This location gives some fantastic
challenges with regard to the visual environment ;-).


We are now trying to delve into the topic on glare and visibility on the
computer screens in the atrium. The traders should be able to read info on
their computer screens at all times and not at any point in time experience
glare from daylight. We have a full Radiance model ready. With regard to
evaluation of glare from daylight, we will run Radiance simulations and
evaluate the scene both with respect to UDI (zero area with UDI > 3000 lx)
and DGP (threshold 0.35).
However, I'm in doubt of what to do with regard to experienced glare and
visibility on the computer screens. I have skimmed through Niloofar Mogbels
dissertation, and can read that she has developed a model for visibility
glare on computer screens.
Do you have any information/comments with regard to this model ?
How far are you with the implementation of the tool gen_vf and gen_vfd ?
Does there exist more information on the programs somewhere ? A small
tutorial ? Are typical Radiance descriptions of different types of computer
screens available ?

Would you guide me to other methods ?

Thanks  in advance for any guidance.
All the best,
Anne

Hi George,

I just want to add to what Lars said, which is correct.  Turbidity does not affect the light distribution in gensky.  

Sadly, we don't have a genocean to create lighting environments for underwater -- that would be a nice addition!  If you are trying to simulate absorption and scattering in a participating medium, you can try playing around with the -m* options to affect the global environment.  There is also the "mist" primitive for controlling local media and scattering from specific light sources.  The single-scatter approximation used in Radiance is very approximate, however, and specifying a non-zero global extinction coefficient then having light sources infinitely distant (a la the "source" type) results in a lamentable zero contribution to the scene.

However, there's no reason in the case of the ocean that you couldn't use one mist sphere for water surface, indicating the sun as the source, and you should get roughly the correct behavior down below.

Cheers,
-Greg

Thanks Lars/Greg,

Ah, I had expected increased turbidity to result in scattering that 
correlated with object-distance.

I was hoping to estimate (roughly) how scatter changes the colour of 
stuff beneath water as a function of turbidity and distance (and viewing 
direction). I may need to rein in my ambitions.


With regard to mist: By "specfic light sources" I take it you don't mean 
gensky then? Do you have a simple example of mist being used in a small 
model? I can then work this into my already bloated matlab wrapper.

"genocean" I get it ;-) , but not before foolishly googling-it!

George

Hi Chris,

I'm cross-posting answer to Radiance-general where this probably belongs.  You should subscribe there if you aren't already.

Your error message is very strange.  I'd be interested to hear if others have run across this before.  It seems related to attempts to change or remove files that are currently being used as executables.  It doesn't really make sense to me in the context of your script.  This is one of the pages Google pointed me to:

Hi Ehsan,

There are ways to do this, but you need to be a little more specific about what data you are starting from.  Otherwise, it's difficult to offer direction.

Dear Greg,

I developed a model which applies angular distance between any point on the
sky and Sun disc to calculate radiance fraction and then having radiance
distribution and horizontal diffuse irradiation, radiance or even luminance
of each point under clear sky condition can be calculated! I hope this
information can be useful:)

Cheers,

Ehsan
