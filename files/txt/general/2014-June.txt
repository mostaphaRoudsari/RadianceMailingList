Subject: [Radiance-general] su2rad update for SketchUp 2014
Message-ID: <CAKGV-k0sVwxNbwae6nGSZWm+N_POZi1cQsxCCiqyGVCw3HzVQw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone.

I have just updated my plugin su2rad to fix a problem that was introduced
by SketchUp 2014 that was released earlier this year.

This is a just quick fix to solve the compatibility issue and also packages
the plugin as a SketchUp extension. The extension can be managed via the
extension manager built into the SketchUp preferences dialog so you don't
need to dig for the SketchUp "Plugins" directory to install the plugin.
Beginning with SketchUp 2014 plugins are installed into the user's personal
home directory and so the installation of the extension does not require
administrative rights on the PC any more.

Unfortunately Google has discontinued the download feature for Google Code
projects so I am hosting the new plugin temporarily on my Dropbox account
until I can move the whole project over to github. The temporary download
location is

https://www.dropbox.com/s/pewocv4df0i2i05/su2rad_2014.0.0.rbz

I have done some testing on SketchUp 8 and 2014 both on Windows 7 and OS X
10.7.5. I only tested that the plugin works in general but have not done
any extensive verification. However, there have been no large changes to
the code so I don't expect that there are any problems that haven't been
there for quite a while. If you find any bugs or other issues please report
these back to my email address for now. I will send out another email when
the new code hosting is set up and reporting of bugs is possible.

Enjoy.

Thomas

Thank you Rob. From your link I realized for the US site (for GE) I was on
the consumer site that doesn't have all the available lamps and .ies files.

US commercial site for reference:

One question I have is should the luminous opening be 0 0 0, a point source
when input into ies2rad?

Lots more out there? If you find Toshiba, they are no longer manufactured.

Brian,
Typically the manufacturer or lab will provide the luminous aperture specs.
0 0 0 represent x y z dimensions
To create a circular 6" aperture  use   -.5 0 0 (note the minus sign)
A 6" square is    .5 .5 0

The "1" before the aperture dimensions indicates units in feet, "2" for
meters.

ies2rad includes the -dx flag (x=f feet, m meters, i inches etc) to
convert ies aperture specifications into the units of your model.

For some reason Im not seeing the light. Here's the steps Im following:

1. In the IES file I change the units to feet and set the circular aperture:
Filename: 230V_6500K_25_E27_3_IESNA95.IES 
Header info:

IESNA:LM-63-1995

TILT=NONE
1 1246 1.000 181 13 1 1 -0.500 0.000 0.000
1.000 1 19.2


2. Run IES2RAD:
ies2rad -df -t default -m .85 230V_6500K_25_E27_3_IESNA95.IES

Note: In the brightdata description, I expected the value 46.5971 to be
0.85? I tried it both ways without luck.

I tried changing the ring orientation around (default below) to make sure Im
not missing the light, but I haven't seen it. 

Think maybe Ive been staring at this too long! Appreciate any ideas?

Don't edit the IES file to change to feet before you run it through ies2rad unless you're very confident in this. There should be a marker value in the IES file that indicate what units the dimensions are given in, so if you manually edit the dimension to feet, you also have to change the marker to tell it you've changed to feet. The -df option that you give to ies2rad should read the units of the IES file, accounting for the units it was created in, and convert it to feet for you. Also, confirm the units in your radiance scene are in feet, and no conversions happened in your output if you're using any modeling software (e.g. a square from 0,0,0 to 1,1,1 has 1ft long sides and area of 1ft2).

Also, one of those things that seems obvious but easy to forget, double check any transformations of the radiance light source definition put the light in the place you are expecting it, if you're using the xform command or similar.

Dear Kyle,

such PV panels are not easy to model. The reflected light that you are 
probably interested in is mainly the light reflected from the 
front-glazing. Glass panes used for PV panels are typically structured 
with pyramids, smooth structures and such. So without knowing the 
reflective properties of the frontglazing, modeling the panel will be 
try and error. The built-in material models are probably not 
approximating the reflective behaviour of the panel at all.

Cheers,
Lars.

Dear Kyle,

We did some reflective modeling of a PV array causing glare at an airport  
where such models were very important. There was no possibility of a  
goniophotometer measurement, so we settled with using a portable  
spectrophotometer to get total reflectance and HDR photography to  
approximate the range of 'specular spread' depending on the angle of the  
sun. Its definitely not perfect, but worked well for the study. You can  
read more from the link at the front of this paragraph.

Best,
Alstan

Thanks for all the help. After going back and reviewing the units amongst my files and getting everything positioned properly it is now working!

One small stumbling block, I was initially using a negative value to scale in xform instead of a decimal (-2 vs .5) which obviously doesn?t work. Apparently I got used to using the negative value with the AIM, PIVOT, etc in rvu, and transferred that to xform!

Message-ID: <3B1958D3-F4EB-42F3-9BAA-366095167084@ubiobio.cl>

Dear Thomas,

Thank you for the information provided in your website, it has been very helpful.I am attempting to run Radiance simulation via Sketch Up 8 pro (instead of doing it through Ecotect). I installed the Sketch Up to Radiance plugin (su2rad_1.0.alpha version), and there are some doubts about the exporting process I wish to ask if you can help me with. First I?d like to ask, how would you recommend exporting the files to radiance in order to achieve the best results (by colour, by layer or by group)?. Related to that, I wish to ask if there?s a way to obtain a single file that contents all the geometry in it, because so far I have found the best way is to export by layers but it creates multiple files that content the geometry (basically one file per layer) in the objects folder.

Also, I?m struggling to find a way to create the analysis grid in Sketch Up (or within the plugin) in order to obtain a grid. pts file, so if you know how to do that it would be extremely helpful. 

Finally, if there were any guidelines that you could provide of how to optimize the results, whether it is related to the model building or the exporting process, it would be much appreciated.

 Thank you for your time.

Hi Maria

Thanks for giving su2rad a try. I have recently updated the installer
package and it's now available as a SketchUp extension as well. It's not
available in the Extension Warehouse yet but you can download it here:

https://www.dropbox.com/s/pewocv4df0i2i05/su2rad_2014.0.0.rbz

I think that all the features that you require are already in the "alpha"
release although they are not fully tested. Now to your questions:

1) *By layer vs. by color vs. by group*: The "by layer" mode is useful for
models that have been imported from a CAD application and have the elements
separated by layers. You don't need to reorganize your model to separate
the model components like floors and walls etc. "By color" separates the
elements based on their SketchUp color or material. You would use this for
models created in SketchUp to separate the building elements for Radiance
to study for example different wall reflectivity values. Finally the "by
group" option keeps the SketchUp scene structure with groups and components
and translates it to nested *.rad files. This is the most efficient way to
export complex scenes that have many detailed components like chairs or
other furniture. The simplest option is probably "by color".

2) You can create a single file by passing the scene *.rad file that is
created for a scene through xform:

xform scene_1.rad > scene_1_expanded.rad


Xform reads all the referenced files and combines their content into a
single file, including any optional transformations.

3) To create an analysis grid you have to create a layer called "numeric".
Then create a polygon on this layer to represent your work plane (for
example copy the floor to the work plane height, then "shrink" the boundary
with the offset tool and delete the outer ring). Create a group for this
polygon (or more than one) and give it a name. That's the name the *.pts
file will get. During the export this polygon will be exported to a *.pts
file with points in the global coordinate system (i.e. suitable to use in
Radiance). The grid spacing is fixed to 0.25m in x an y and the direction
of the ray is fixed to (0,0,1).

4) I don't know how you could "optimize" the results. You can optimize the
rendering time but that depends largely on your scene and the purpose of
your calculations. You can ask on the Radiance mailing list for
optimization tips. Please provide details about your scene and your render
settings. In terms of modeling you should avoid large differences in scale.
If you are modeling an entire building don't go into too much detail, just
make holes for the windows and a rough shape for the window frames, but
nothing too sophisticated. A simple rectangular section will do. Also try
to model a clean and well structured SketchUp model. It's good to model the
interior walls of a room separate from the exterior to avoid any issues
with interpolation. To avoid issues with surface materials I would group
elements with the same material together and apply the color to the group
and not an individual polygon. That will avoid problems where surfaces can
have different front and back materials. Radiance can only use one.

In general the exporter does not care about the quality of the model. It
will take whatever there is in SU and export it to Radiance as accurate as
possible.

Regards,
Thomas

Hello Everyone,

Does anyone know of a software that can calculate the LEED v4 Daylight 
credit requirements for Option 1. Simulation? It requires Spatial 
Daylight Autonomy and Annual Sunlight Exposure per IES LM 83.

Thanks,
Jill

Hi Jill,

I inquired about this to the Diva folks and they said that the recently released DAYSIM-PS does.  That version is not yet bundled into Diva and  I have not checked into it further at this point.

That's all I know but hopefully we will get some more responses here with encouraging news!

Hi Jill,

Yes, you want to talk to Rick Mistrick about this; "DAYSIM-PS" is being developed to (among other things) calculate the daylight metrics sDA and ASE as per LM-83. Also check in with Kevin Van Den Wymelenberg at IDL-Boise (http://www.idlboise.com/), as those guys developed a Python script a while back that would also do the calculations.

- Rob

Hi,

I am now looking to use radiance after learning daysim. I have successfully completed the tutorial and am now looking to produce renders from scenes set up in SketchUp.
Here is a link to the SketchUp output file:
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/uyokuvxiu9s1ifb/AAB5TXbez6p8-FAgl3EeR4f2a

My approach is to apply the OCONV function to the ?test.rad? file.
However unlike in the tutorial, materials and geometry are housed in separate directories.
 And I get the following errors:
oconv test.rad > test.oct
xform: cannot find file "objects/Material133.rad"
oconv: warning - (!xform objects/Material133.rad): empty file

 I don?t quite understand why the file can?t be found.
Am I using the correct approach?
Thanks in advance for your help.

Ross

Hi Ross,

You need to include the materials file in the oconv command, and have it before the geometry.  Try:

oconv materials.rad test.rad > test.oct

or, to view the scene 'on the fly':

objview materials.rad test.rad

For a beginner it's usually easier to use the rad command with the *.rif
file to get scenes rendered.

$ rad test.rif


That will start rendering all scenes and create the images - in your case
only one.

However, looking at the *.rif file I see that there is a warning at the end:

## total number of objects too large


Unfortunately I don't remember why I put this message there. There may be a
built-in limit for oconv or another process in Radiance. What happens if
you combine all the output files to a single file with the xform command?

xform test.rad > test_combined.rad


If this works you can run oconv with the test_combined.rad file:

oconv test_combined.rad > test.oct



BTW: Is there a specific reason to have so many materials in your scene?
Most of your scene files contain only a few polygons. You can also try to
export the scene by group or by layer in su2rad. That (probably) reduces
the file count and can solve your problem.

Regards,
Thomas

Hi,

Thanks for the prompt responses. I will respond to both in sequence.

Ross

Message 1

Hi John,

'oconv materials.rad test.rad > test.oct'

still produces the error message 'xform: cannot find file...'

I have added a screenshot (error1) to the folder below:

https://www.dropbox.com/sh/uyokuvxiu9s1ifb/AAB5TXbez6p8-FAgl3EeR4f2a



With regards to 'objview' I don't actually have that program.

I downloaded a windows version of radiance from the link below and it wasn't included.

https://openstudio.nrel.gov/getting-started-developer/getting-started-radiance


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Message 2

Hi Thomas

'rad test.rif' runs and produces and HDR file but it is completely black.


'xform test.rad > test_combined.rad' again gives an error that it can't find the file 'test.rad' which is clearly at the location.

I have put a screenshot of the error into the my dropbox folder (error2)

https://www.dropbox.com/sh/uyokuvxiu9s1ifb/AAB5TXbez6p8-FAgl3EeR4f2a


The huge number of materials was because I had previously imported some DAYSIM results. These have now been purged off an the export files updated.

Ross,

Ah, I (wrongly) assumed you were using UNIX (linux or Mac).

I was surprised at the number of individual materials / rad files until I used objview and saw that this is how results can be displayed: as a false-colour 'grid' with each tile having its own material (i.e. shade) and rad file.

Yes, if you try to run oconv on the contents of the objects directory it will complain: "oconv: internal - too many scene files".

Cheers

Hi Jill - 
IES-VE does Spatial Daylight Autonomy and Annual Sunlight Exposure per IES LM 83. 
Please note that the current version assumes static blinds in the daylight simulation for this v4 credit.  

Feel free to join our next web-demo: http://www.iesve.com/software/web-demo

Hi Jill,

Yes, you want to talk to Rick Mistrick about this; "DAYSIM-PS" is being developed to (among other things) calculate the daylight metrics sDA and ASE as per LM-83. Also check in with Kevin Van Den Wymelenberg at IDL-Boise (http://www.idlboise.com/), as those guys developed a Python script a while back that would also do the calculations.

Hi Jill,

I inquired about this to the Diva folks and they said that the recently released DAYSIM-PS does.  That version is not yet bundled into Diva and  I have not checked into it further at this point.

That?s all I know but hopefully we will get some more responses here with encouraging news!

Hello Everyone,

Does anyone know of a software that can calculate the LEED v4 Daylight credit requirements for Option 1. Simulation? It requires Spatial Daylight Autonomy and Annual Sunlight Exposure per IES LM 83.

Thanks,

Ross,

I think this is because you don't have the current working directory in
your RAYPATH.
This is a fault in the instructions on setting RAYPATH on NREL's installer
page. I'd tell you how to rectify it, but I personally don't know how to
indicate current working directory in a Windows environment variable (on
*nix systems it's a period). a work around is to use the whole path in the
rad file (starting with c:) but you have a space in one of your directory
names, so you'd have to do something to escape the space (on *nix it's a
backslash before the space - Don't know if it's the same on Windows).

Can any Windows Radiance user help with including the current working
directory in RAYPATH?

Andy

If you install the latest open studio version, it will install radiance with
the necessary settings, then you do not need to set the paths manually.

Hi John,

'oconv materials.rad test.rad > test.oct'

Hi Thomas

'rad test.rif' runs and produces and HDR file but it is completely black.


'xform test.rad > test_combined.rad' again gives an error that it can't find
the file 'test.rad' which is clearly at the location.

I have put a screenshot of the error into the my dropbox folder (error2)

https://www.dropbox.com/sh/uyokuvxiu9s1ifb/AAB5TXbez6p8-FAgl3EeR4f2a


The huge number of materials was because I had previously imported some
DAYSIM results. These have now been purged off an the export files updated.

Hi Ross,

You need to include the materials file in the oconv command, and have it
before the geometry.  Try:

oconv materials.rad test.rad > test.oct

or, to view the scene 'on the fly':

objview materials.rad test.rad

Cheers

For a beginner it's usually easier to use the rad command with the *.rif
file to get scenes rendered.

$ rad test.rif


That will start rendering all scenes and create the images - in your case
only one.

However, looking at the *.rif file I see that there is a warning at the end:

## total number of objects too large


Unfortunately I don't remember why I put this message there. There may be a
built-in limit for oconv or another process in Radiance. What happens if you
combine all the output files to a single file with the xform command?

xform test.rad > test_combined.rad


If this works you can run oconv with the test_combined.rad file:

oconv test_combined.rad > test.oct



BTW: Is there a specific reason to have so many materials in your scene?
Most of your scene files contain only a few polygons. You can also try to
export the scene by group or by layer in su2rad. That (probably) reduces the
file count and can solve your problem.

Regards,
Thomas

Hmm, I thought the dot worked on Win, too. This is why we have that direction on the OpenStudio page. But then again, I recall writing the Radiance translator so that it makes references to scene files like so:

!xform ./scene/shading_building.rad
!xform ./scene/shading_site.rad

So I guess somewhere along the way I found the dot to be lacking.

Perhaps it's time to update that page, eh? Thanks for the heads up, Andy. Oh, and yeah the backslash escapes the space in the filename on Windows too.

P.S.
This may be a breadcrumb trail for someone to follow, if interested in reliably referencing the CWD in your Windows environments:

Ross,

I think this is because you don't have the current working directory in your RAYPATH.
This is a fault in the instructions on setting RAYPATH on NREL's installer page. I'd tell you how to rectify it, but I personally don't know how to indicate current working directory in a Windows environment variable (on *nix systems it's a period). a work around is to use the whole path in the rad file (starting with c:) but you have a space in one of your directory names, so you'd have to do something to escape the space (on *nix it's a backslash before the space - Don't know if it's the same on Windows).

Can any Windows Radiance user help with including the current working directory in RAYPATH?

Hi John,

'oconv materials.rad test.rad > test.oct'

still produces the error message 'xform: cannot find file...'

I have added a screenshot (error1) to the folder below:

With regards to 'objview' I don't actually have that program.

I downloaded a windows version of radiance from the link below and it wasn't included.

Hi Thomas

'rad test.rif' runs and produces and HDR file but it is completely black.


'xform test.rad > test_combined.rad' again gives an error that it can't find the file 'test.rad' which is clearly at the location.

I have put a screenshot of the error into the my dropbox folder (error2)

https://www.dropbox.com/sh/uyokuvxiu9s1ifb/AAB5TXbez6p8-FAgl3EeR4f2a


The huge number of materials was because I had previously imported some DAYSIM results. These have now been purged off an the export files updated.

Hi Tim

Static; meaning not moving at varying hourly intervals.  The blinds (as components) are set at wherever you put them; be it always up, always down or always somewhere in between. 

If you want to see more, please join the web-demo, see the info previously provided. 

Thanks
Liam

Liam,

what does static blinds mean? The blinds are always down?

Thanks,
Tim

Dear Thomas:

First of all, thank you very much for your suggestions.

I would like to ask you for counselling regarding a problem I am experiencing with the rendering process. I have built my Sketch up model, and I exported it to radiance(using the su2rad_1.0_alpha version) and I?m in the rendering stage (rpict). The problem is that the window frame elements are not visualizing well: they appear undefined and missing some parts (as shown in the link below).

https://www.dropbox.com/sh/lwvi9f35e0r33pv/AACqWAvwn0Wx7ybWb1OVno78a

I used 2 types of Radiance parameters, first I used the very accurate parameter, and since this didn?t seem to improve the image I increased these parameters, but this problem continues to happen.

I don?t know if maybe I?m doing something wrong with the su2rad geometry exporting process because I have done this from Ecotect to Radiance before and I haven?t had this issue.
I?m sending you the link to the folders that contain these files so you can give me your opinion and hopefully help me to solve this.

Again, thank you for your time.

Hi Maria,

The problem you're seeing is aliasing. It's a common problem in rendering
that is usually solved by rendering the image larger and down-sampling. The
rendering has a (default) resolution of 512x512. If you increase the size
to say 1536x1536 then use pfilt to down sample you should get a much nicer
image.

Here are example commands:

rpict *-x 1536 -y 1536 *-vth -vh 180 -vv 180 -vp 1.20 5.5 1.5 ab 7 -av 0.01
0.01 0.01 -dp 4096 -ad 8192 -as 4096 -ar 160 -ms 0.085 -ds 0.2 -dt 0.05 -dc
0.75 -dr 3 -sj 1 -st 0.1 -aa 0.08 -lr 12 -lw .005 sunny_21-03_12-00.oct >
results/zn_b2_sin_sunny_21-03_12-00_full.pic

pfilt -x 1024 -y 1024 -r 1 results/zn_b2_sin_sunny_21-03_12-00_b.pic |
pfilt -x 512 -y 512 > results/zn_b2_sin_sunny_21-03_12-00_filtered.pic

(I like to do a double pfilt using a gaussian filter with high radius on
the first and then regular box filtering on the second)

This command will take longer since it is rendering 9x as many pixels, but
you can probably reduce most of the parameters (ad, as, ar, aa etc.) to
increase speed (they seem a bit excessive for this model)

Here's an example I rendered (with much lower parameters for faster
rendering):
https://www.dropbox.com/sc/xxs0i7srcruoe46/AAARZz-44yjktcpcDTFLdUvEa (your
original rendering is on the left and my filtered rendering is on the right)

Best,
Andy

Subject: [Radiance-general] What to do when no Weather File is available?
Message-ID: <CAK+g53AE_gnou2nUazCZCO8m_FrqdFdX9CMX3N5tOXgU=W2cFw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Everyone,

This question may be slightly out of the scope of this list; however, I
guess people here might be able to answer it.

I have been wondering, during the last few months, what do people do when
there is no available Weather File for a certain location.

An example is my country: there are 5 EPW available for Chile and one of
them is for Easter Island. For those who do not know, Chile is a very long
country, with many climates and latitudes. For what I remember from my
undergraduate classes, solar radiation can be obtained from monthly data.
Can we do anything for relative humidity and temperature?

Is there any other source of weather files that can be used? How about
Stocastic Weather Files generators?

Hi German,

in those cases, we usually use "Meteonorm" to generate a specific weather data set. It  interpolates from the closest weather stations and they have a huge data basis. For Chile I would guess around 20 (just rough estimation looking at the map).
But it is important to know that the hourly irradiation data is generated stochastically from the monthly data (from the weather stations), so Meteonorm does not use hourly measured data as basis.

So in some kind you get a artificial weather data set, based on the interpolation of real measurements.
It includes also temperature and humidity, all you need for thermal simulation, too.

The output can be chosen in different formats, also epw.

cheers,

Jan

Thanks Raphael and Jan,

I assume Meteonorm would be the best source of information for these kind
of cases. However; is that data representative enough to use it for design
just as if it were a measured data? Should we take anything special into
account?

THANKS!

Subject: [Radiance-general] Invalid spotlight direction
Message-ID: <CACxzXYz7WaLyFs5hyJh+HfAOwa1U6n8Pb9A5BaZv=eebLE76JA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Radiance experts,
I'm new to radiance and I've came across a problem when using the spotlight
as light source in the scene generation.

In radiance manual I see:
direction (-inf:inf),(-inf:inf),(-inf:inf) Min &
Max infinite
any aimed orientation

Which means I could use any vector as an orientation. But when I tried to
use:
void spotlight lightring3
0
0
7 2000 2000 2000 60 0 1 0
I get a warning: rpict: warning - invalid spotlight direction for ring
"spot2.downlight3"

I'm not sure which part I did wrong. Could I specify a spotlight with
direction 0 1 0?
Best,
Vera

Hi Vera,

I love these sorts of questions, because it means I get to look at code I haven't touched in years...

In this case, I don't think the problem is with your spotlight specification per se.  Rather, I believe the vector orientation disagrees with whatever surface you have applied it to.  Radiance makes a check to be sure that the spotlight direction is not "behind" the surface you use it with, and this generated an error in your case.  Check the geometry you are using with your spotlight, and I think you'll find the problem.

Best,
-Greg

Hi Greg,
That was really helpful. I found the problem was because the surface. Thank
you for the prompt reply!

Subject: [Radiance-general] What to do when no Weather File is available?

Hi German,

Another consideration is the rationale for the evaluation/simulation.  Whilst none of the standardised climate files you have are ideally appropriate for some particular locale, they do provide a common 'yardstick' against which variations in design can be compared.  This has long been the case with dynamic thermal modelling where the comparison of relative outcomes may be just as important (and possibly more reliable) than the absolute outcomes.

For most of Europe there is an abundance of standardised climate files, and the gradients in climatic diversity are - for the most part - not that steep.  However, Chile, as you point out, covers both a huge span in latitude and 'horizontally' it has very steep gradients in prevailing climatic conditions.  Thus satellite-derived data may be a more suitable basis for evaluation.  Perhaps a comparison in outcomes between using standardised climate data and satellite-derived for those 5 locations you have would be a worthwhile exercise.  One would not expect absolute values to be the same, but if the rank ordering is wildly different then it's a case of exercising some judgement regarding selection.

Cheers
John

Hi Liam,

If IES-VE does not move blinds based on solar penetration (2% criteria) as
described in LM-83, then the sDA results will incorrect. To get the LEED
credit you need to use the method prescribed in LM-83 and that means you
need to have blinds/shades that are not "static"

Mudit Saxena

I seem to be having similar trouble - I assume this hasn't been resolved as 
I'm using Radiance 4.2.a.4 from 17 April 2014? 

I've tried a couple of workarounds, using "run as administrator" on the 
cmd.exe, Perl.exe, a shortcut.lnk for genklemsamp, and genklemsamp.pl 
itself. None seemed to work.

genklemsamp.pl -vp 50 0 25 -vh 80 -vv 40 -vd 0 -1 0 > samplerays_1.dat

The above in DOS cmd, creates the file samplerays_1.dat but it contains 0KB.

Any suggestions or developments on solving this? 
Thanks for any help,

Folks

I have this question for a long time and have asked it to a number of
people with a negative answer, and I can't remember if I have asked the
forum, but here it goes: is there a way that we can import the illuminance
contour back to SketchUp?

We use SketchUp as the interface to Radiance, but the missing piece that we
missed from Ecotect is the ability to import back the illuminance values on
the grid back into the 3D model, so that the contour can be put into the 3D
context.

Thanks

Ery

Su2rad has that feature but it may be disabled in the official version. You just need to remove a few comments in the loader file to get it working. In which format does Ecotect report the values? Just values or coordinates and values?

Hi Everyone,

LBNL has installed an HDR sky camera at our new FLEXLAB site:
http://flexskycam.lbl.gov. I've uploaded sample data, including hdr images
and csv datafiles, recorded by the camera for three days over the past
week( clear, partly cloudy and overcast). We're happy to share more data
with other researchers and daylight practitioners (but we don't have much
to offer yet).

The images can be mapped to a Radiance sky for simulation under real sky
conditions. I have not used the sky HDR images yet, myself, so if anybody
uses them successfully please report back and share what you've done!

Questions about the camera hardware and capabilities should be directed to
Chris Humann at Terrestrial Light.

Best,
Andy

Thanks Thomas. I will definitely try it. Ecotect I think reports only the
values, it saves it with the extension ".ok", but I will double check.
However, it will fall in the right location on the 3D model, so I think it
is checked against the grid information.

Hi, Andy, thanks for sharing LBNL's sky mapping experiment!

Can you kindly advice on resources that elaborate on how to use HDR sky
image for daylight simulation? Does it involve specifying the HDR image,
rather than a "skyfunc", as the material identifier for the sky geometry?
How is the pixel value of a given point on the HDR image converted to
luminance value of the corresponding position on the sky?

Thanks!
- Joe

Wow, I have been thinking on doing this for a while... although I have no
idea where to start from.

Is it possible to calculate the Daylight Coefficients of the building; and
use the HDR image to generate sky vectors and calculate different options
for optimizing daylighting?

I am picturing a computer that, every 5 minutes, calculate the sky vector,
computes the interior lighting conditions, and simulates the different
lighting options performing a whole-building lighting control with no photo
sensors. Even more, maybe a whole neighborhood could use the same camera.
Nonsense?

Thanks for sharing!

Iirc you load the values in Ecotect into the grid and not directly into the
model. So Ecotect can assign the values sequentially to the grid points. In
su2rad you don't have that association and need to provide the coordinates
in the same file. You can use the Unix tool 'join' to combine the
coordinates from the points file and the results. If you are not used to
command line tools you can also use Excel and export the sheet as CSV file.

Hi German, and everyone else. Certainly one could use these HDR images to
generate sky vectors and apply them to daylight coefficients for a given
model(s). Greg Ward has created a cool tool called mksource to facilitate
this process in Radiance, identifying small, intense pixels in the image;
creating and placing Radiance light sources in their stead, and zeroing the
pixels to avoid double counting.

Considerations:
- Capturing the true (full) dynamic range of an exterior scene with direct
sun is difficult.
- Using locally-captured HDR images for daylight availability analysis is
statistically dubious. Granted, so is using TMY data, for different
reasons. This is why I changed the title of this list to "considerations",
from "problems". =)

Hi All,

I haven't done any testing myself, I wanted to make the data available
right away so that others could tinker too (and maybe make it easier for
me).

Joe - You're correct that the HDR sky image essentially replaces the
skyfunc modifier, here's a thread where Kyle was doing the same thing:
http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-October/008962.html


Rob - In a clear sky condition our HDR images won't capture the full
luminance of the sun. Mksource would be helpful to zero out the pixels, but
the source that it makes won't be useful without adjusting the radiance of
the source to match that of the sun.

Best,
Andy

I think that a reasonable approach is to use the global illuminance reading to determine the direct + indirect integrated total, then compare this to the integration of the HDR sky dome recording.  You can then add in a solar source whose solid angle is enlarged to cover the "clipped" pixels in the HDR image, adjusting its radiance such that the new total:

	integrated_masked_HDR + solar_source*adj_solid_angle*cos_theta = measured_illuminance

The larger sun that includes circumsolar will lead to slightly enlarged penumbras in some cases, but it's a reasonable compromise.  I'm sure a script could be made to automate the above process without too much effort.

Cheers,
-Greg

Hi Greg,

> The larger sun that includes circumsolar will lead to slightly enlarged penumbras in some cases, but it's a reasonable compromise.

I thought that (with default settings) a single ray is used to sample a "light" source solid angle, resulting in no solar penumbra.  Has this changed and/or am I misunderstanding this?

Yes, you're right.  It's only if you use the PENUMBRAS=True in rad or set -dj > 0 that you'll actually see the penumbras from light sources, including the sun.

Hi, I found 2 references and did a test to generate HDR image-based
rendering, steps are explained below.

But I'm still rubbing my head to understand how the Cartesian coordinates
or the postion vector of a point on the sky is transformed as UV
coordinates of the fisheye image as shown in the "angmap.cal" file. So,
advices are greatly appreciated!

Thanks!
Joe

Hi German,

There is some interesting work on simulation based controls for daylighting from the TU Wien. See here:

Wow, I have been thinking on doing this for a while... although I have no idea where to start from.

Is it possible to calculate the Daylight Coefficients of the building; and use the HDR image to generate sky vectors and calculate different options for optimizing daylighting?

I am picturing a computer that, every 5 minutes, calculate the sky vector, computes the interior lighting conditions, and simulates the different lighting options performing a whole-building lighting control with no photo sensors. Even more, maybe a whole neighborhood could use the same camera. Nonsense?

Thanks for sharing!

Hi, Andy, thanks for sharing LBNL's sky mapping experiment!

Can you kindly advice on resources that elaborate on how to use HDR sky image for daylight simulation? Does it involve specifying the HDR image, rather than a "skyfunc", as the material identifier for the sky geometry? How is the pixel value of a given point on the HDR image converted to luminance value of the corresponding position on the sky?

Thanks!
- Joe

Hi Everyone,

LBNL has installed an HDR sky camera at our new FLEXLAB site: http://flexskycam.lbl.gov. I've uploaded sample data, including hdr images and csv datafiles, recorded by the camera for three days over the past week( clear, partly cloudy and overcast). We're happy to share more data with other researchers and daylight practitioners (but we don't have much to offer yet).

The images can be mapped to a Radiance sky for simulation under real sky conditions. I have not used the sky HDR images yet, myself, so if anybody uses them successfully please report back and share what you've done!

Questions about the camera hardware and capabilities should be directed to Chris Humann at Terrestrial Light.

Best,
Andy

Hi Joe,

The global values in the CSV file are in footcandles so you will need to multiply them by 10.76 in order to get Lux.

Also, you'll need to add a source description for the sun in order to get the solar contribution as the camera sensor can not capture the intensity of the sun for the HDR image.  Essentially the HDR image allows you to get a close approximation of the global diffuse value.  I use gendaylit (see below) to generate the sun and sky scene. You can get the altitude, azimuth, direct-normal-illuminance and diffuse-horizontal-illuminance from the CSV file (be sure to multiply the latter two values by 10.76 to translate them from footcandles to Lux for input into Gendaylit). Also be sure to adjust your 'rtrace' results by dividing by 10.76 to get footcandles if you want to compare to the global-horizontal-illuminacne readings in the CSV file. 

########Sun and Sky scene -----> global.rad

##########

When I run the above I get a global horizontal illuminance value from 'rtrace' of approx. 6900 footcandles.  The photometer gave a reading of 7176 footcandles.


I'm still working my brain around all this as well and hope that these discussions will foster a better understanding of how to use the HDR images for the highest level of accuracy possible.

Hope this helps.

Best,
Chris

Hi Chris,

Thank you very much for your reply, especially for reminding me the
conversion of the unit between foot candela and lux!

May I ask the following questions?

1. why the hdr fisheye image needs to be rotated along x axis for 90
degrees and along z axis for 180 degrees? using the fisheye.cal file as
reference when defining the colorpict "skypict"?

2. why "skypict is used as a modifier to define the "glow" material
"groundglow"? I thought usually this position is set as "void"


Using your approach, I tried some other hdr image provided by your project,
and it seems the global horizontal illuminance is always underestimated as
compared to the one reported in the csv file.

rubbing my head about this issue, and advices are greatly appreciated!

Regards,
Joe
