Thanks, Jan!

I used an interior setting for the test this time as suggested.

However, I still can't get the correct UGR and Guth-VCP output values.

I'm quite confused as there is no such problem on another computer with
Radiance installed (UGR=33.77, Guth_VCP=0.46).

Hope you can kind advise!

The scene files and the batch file of the Radiance commands are shared in
the following link:
https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B_FMUh4Urmx4dmhaNi16aVdtTWM&usp=sharing
(need to change Z_cmd.txt to Z_cmd.bat)

I'll try evalglare as suggested later.

Thanks!
Joe

Subject: [Radiance-general] IES files and MGF geometry
Message-ID: <CA+dqh63eZpsBikW9kJh4FDv_5QTybPi2z6EQkUecqZLOoKKVvg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list,

would anybody happen to have an example of an IES file with MGF
geometry that they are happy to share?  I have the latest LM-62
(2002), but it doesn't even mention MGF, and I don't seem to be able
to find an example ies file with embedded MGF.

The reason why I'm looking into this is this:  I have a round bollard
light and need to generate the distribution for only the vertical
cylinder, but not the top and bottom which ies2rad generates as well.
I figure that removing the top and bottom 'rings' would invalidate the
photometry.

Many thanks

Regards

Axel

Hi Axel,

Oh wow, an MGF question. In all my years, never. Wow.

Interesting question. I'm not sure what having the MGF description will
buy you in terms of your problem. The MGF is just a geometry section
AFAIK; the photometry is still tied to the ies-format data, so I don't
think you gain any added flexibility there. Depending on how diffuse the
top and bottom of the luminaire are, you probably *could* remove the rings
and have a reasonably fair distribution for the cylinder, but I'm guessing
they are some really diffuse, blobby lenses and so you're getting some
scatter. Another option would be to generate the simple geometry with
ies2rad and then add some sort of "caps" with added geometry to the top
and bottom of the luminous geometry created from ies2rad. Not sure how
accurate the "thing" needs to look, versus the space lighted by the thing.
If you only care about the distribution, this option may work for you.

- Rob

Hi Rob,

thanks for your reply.  Yes, MGF is still alive and kicking--now
officially endorsed by the IESNA as far as I understand.

The product I'm looking at is this:
http://products.iguzzini.com/iway_round
which is why I want to get rid of the top and bottom bits of the
ies2rad geometry.

What I was hoping to be able to do with MGF is tell it what the
fitting looks like.  In this particular case, I'd model 3 stacked
cylinders, enclosed with a disk at the top. Only the middle cylinder
would act as an emitter.  Does that make sense?

Best
Axel

Do I understand that the problem is not generating geometry much taller than the actual lens, but rather that that it generates a cylinder with top and bottom circles, while only the shell of the cylinder is the actual light emitter? I had started to reply regarding adjusting the height in the IES file, but maybe someone else knows a solution for the top/bottom surface problem - which would be good to know.

Ah, I "see". So you have this thing that throws down a great deal, so a
lot of the candelas toward nadir are being mapped to that bottom ring in
the ies2rad translation. My sense is that for the best result you'd want
to use the illum sphere with a large-ish radius ? large enough so that the
output gets mapped to points on the sphere that would fall outside the
supporting post impostor geometry, but small enough that the sphere is
high enough off the ground that the projected light looks "right".
Obviously for critical illuminance calcs you could do one run with just
the emitters (which seem to have been used in the images on the
manufacturer's website), and then for visualization you could use the
illum sphere trick, or get fancy with lboxcorr...

Hi Axel,

Regarding MGF, I wasn't aware that IES ever gave it's official support to the LUMINOUSGEOMETRY tag, and I don't know of any manufacturer's that included this information.  After working on the format for many months, I was rather disappointed that they declined to use it, so I'd be very happy to know otherwise.  The intent of MGF was to provide detail geometry for the fixture's appearance, but it does not technically interact with the photometry.  That would be handled by "imposter" geometry (an illum sphere or similar) enclosing the MGF description.

Regarding your actual problem of representing your luminous geometry as an open cylinder rather than two disks, you will need to do this by hand.  The IES luminaire standard had some odd ways of specifying geometry, involving negative dimensions in the (height,width,depth) fields, and all geometry was assumed to be closed.  The current source.cal file has projection calculations needed to convert candelas (as given in the IES file) to radiance (watts/sr/m^2) as needed for rendering, but only for closed cylinders.  You would have to roll your own if you wanted to remove the end caps to have the correct factors in there.  The current projected area is approximated as:

cylprojection = A2*A3*sqrt(1-Dz*Dz) + PI/4*A2*A2*abs(Dz);

This is only valid for far-field -- I don't have a local projection factor for cylinders in there, like I do for boxes.  You probably need one in your case, but I'm not sure off-hand how to compute it.  The far-field approximation for just the cylinder section would be the first term, above.

Hope this helps!

Cheers,
-Greg

I believe it was included in an early 1990s version of LM-63 (1992?), but it was not used, and removed in the 
next version. :-(

Sympathies.  I wish it had stuck; instead we are getting multiple proprietary formats, each with
their own problems.

Hi Greg,

I only know about this MGF embedding from the ies2rad man page, and
thought it might solve my problem:

" -i rad    Ignore the crude geometry given by the IES input file and
use  instead  an  illum
                 sphere  with radius rad.  This option may be useful
when the user wishes to add a
                 more accurate geometric description to the light
source model, though  this  need
                 is  obviated by the recent LM-63-1995 specification,
which uses MGF detail geome-
                 try.  (See -g option below.)"

This sounds rather more positive than the situation appears to be now.  Oh well.

As you say--I would need near-field for my bollard.  Thank for sending
the projection formula.  With the NF-correction for boxes already in
the code, would a square bollard (again w/o bottom and top) be any
easier to describe?  A square imposter is still a lot better than a
hovering crystal ball.

Many thanks

Best
Axel

After working on the format for many months, I was rather disappointed that they declined to use it, so I'd be very happy to know otherwise.  The intent of MGF was to provide detail geometry for the fixture's appearance, but it does not technically interact with the photometry.  That would be handled by "imposter" geometry (an illum sphere or similar) enclosing the MGF description.

The IES luminaire standard had some odd ways of specifying geometry, involving negative dimensions in the (height,width,depth) fields, and all geometry was assumed to be closed.  The current source.cal file has projection calculations needed to convert candelas (as given in the IES file) to radiance (watts/sr/m^2) as needed for rendering, but only for closed cylinders.  You would have to roll your own if you wanted to remove the end caps to have the correct factors in there.  The current projected area is approximated as:

Hi Axel,

Yes, as Randolph reminds me, LM-63 did have the geometry spec in there.  All I remember is that it was never supported by anyone.  At least we are using MGF in our XML specification for complex fenestration system BSDFs, so it's not a complete waste.

Regarding the local box correction, you could take out the third term "noneg(abs(Pz-Dz*Ts)-A4/2)*A2*A3" from the formula:

lboxprojection = (	noneg(abs(Px-Dx*Ts)-A2/2)*A3*A4 +
			noneg(abs(Py-Dy*Ts)-A3/2)*A2*A4 +
			noneg(abs(Pz-Dz*Ts)-A4/2)*A2*A3 ) / Ts;

I think that should work.

Cheers,
-Greg

Hello again,

I've run some quick tests on with my bollard photometry. falsecolor
images below:

Unaltered IES file as it came from the manufacturer:
http://www.jaloxa.eu/pickup/mr84_li34_fc.jpg
This uses a short, capped cylinder.  rvu complains about
"source aspect too small for cylinder xxx
aiming failure for light source xxx"
Looks weird.

sphere, generated with ies2rad's -i option:
http://www.jaloxa.eu/pickup/mr84_li34_sphere_fc.jpg
This is a little darker than the previous image.

box geometry with all 6 sides (edited IES file):
http://www.jaloxa.eu/pickup/mr84_li34_closed_box_fc.jpg
some 'streaky' artifacts that didn't show up in the sphere image.

box with top and bottom removed. Unaltered source.cal
http://www.jaloxa.eu/pickup/mr84_li34_open_box_fc.jpg
a little darker than the full box

box with top and bottom removed.  source.cal edited as per Greg's instructions
http://www.jaloxa.eu/pickup/mr84_li34_open_box_fixed_fc.jpg
Looks identical to the previous picture.

I used the new ltview command for the previews, so the lower side of
the enclosing plane is much further away than the actual ground would
be.  This might be the reason why the 'corrected' and 'uncorrected'
open boxes produce the same results.  Equally, there is hardly any
downward or upward component.  Virtually all of the emitted light is
projected into a narrow strip.  It still seems as if the open box does
emit a little less light than its closed brother, even with the
correction in source.cal

Best
Axel

Hi Axel,

Interesting results.  The correction of removing the third term for the local box correction would make the most difference in the upwards and downwards direction, so the sparse output there is why you don't see anything in your falsecolor comparison.  You could try computing a difference image using src/cal/cal/picdiff.cal.

Also, the differences between using a large sphere and the lboxcorr won't be noticeable until your surfaces are up close.  What did you set -dj to in your runs?  This will also make a difference, and could show up artifacts in some of the simpler methods.

Cheers,
-Greg

Hi Greg,

the -dj is set by the rad command, which is behind ltview.

render= -av 0 0 0
INDIRECT= 0
QUALITY= Med
DETAIL= Low
VARIABILITY= Med

http://radiance-online.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/ray/src/util/ltview.pl?view=markup

I was also thinking whether or not the intensity of the actual 'light'
material, as created by ies2rad, should be modified since the total
surface area is smaller with the top and bottom of the box removed.
But then, I guess you would have mentioned this.

I will re-run the images with rpict proper and do a diff, but won't be
able to do this until early next week.

Thank you for your help

The correction of removing the third term for the local box correction would make the most difference in the upwards and downwards direction, so the sparse output there is why you don't see anything in your falsecolor comparison.

Dear List,

We're in the early stages of planning next year's workshop, which will be held at the Penn State University's Naval Yard facility in Philadelphia, PA.  We are currently considering dates in the late August/September time frame.

If you are thinking of going and might be able to make it one time but not another, please make yourself heard at this time.  Also, if anyone is aware of competing or complimentary conferences during this period, that would be helpful.

Cheers,
-Greg

Hi,

late August would be good for me as well.
If I'm right Velux changed the date for their daylight symposium to
September 2-3, so this might be a reason to avoid these days?

Hi Joe,

good question!!
I apologize, the version on the Fraunhofer server is v11 and does not 
include the disability glare equation yet.

I'll set up a new web-site for evalglare here at EPFL soon - then a 
version v14 will be available (just some small bugfixes between v12 and 
v14).

Are you running 1)windows or 2)mac or 3)linux?

In case of 2) and 3) I can send you the source code directly to your 
email-address.

Jan

Dear Dr Wienold,

Thank you very much for your reply!

I'm using Radiance on both Windows7 64bit and Mac OS X 10.10, if it's not
too troublesome.

And looking forward to seeing your evalglare website!

Much obliged!

Any help will be appreciated.

I haven't used Ecotect in a long time, so I don't really know what it means to "use Ecotect to simulate light pipes". I have used Radiance in the past to model them, usually using the photometric files supplied by Solatube. These files assume a certain amount of luminous flux, and apply that to a blobby distribution based on a straight tube of fixed length, and certain combination(s) of lenses at either end. Obviously this characterizes a certain time step, or season (see the manufacturers' websites for details). The flux can be scaled with a script to do a crude annual simulation, which I have done in the past.

Andy McNeil posted an exciting example of how you might use the new rfluxmtx tool in Radiance to do a proper climate based annual simulation based on daylight coefficients at the 2014 Radiance Workshop, which you can check out here (starting at slide 92):

Hi Ehsan,

The gensky command has overcast and clear sky distributions based on an older CIE standard.  I don't remember which one, but gensky was written in the late 80's.  Subsequently in 1991 or so, I added an "intermediate" sky type, but I'm not sure it adheres to the newer 2002 standard.

Most people who care about the sky distribution using gendaylit, but if enough people really want it, I could see about updating gensky to the current CIE standard(s).

Cheers,
-Greg

Dear All,

 

I am new to Radiance and trying to show the effect of light  pipes in
daylight levels with ECOTECT and Radiance. I have created the building in
ECOTECT but unable to model the light pipes exactly. Is there any reference
document for the same? Or if anyone can guide me in detail how to model the
same?

Any help will be appreciated.

 

Many Thanks,

Bhartendu Awasthi

With respect to Radiance, I believe this question has been answered (or started) here:

If you're looking for Ecotect-specific ideas for this, you may get more timely responses in an Autodesk forum or list.

Hi Dr. Ward,

I will happy to have latest version of sky model. I know it is time consuming to program and update the gensky but as its part of my research work, I'll be glad if I can take part in updating it.

Cheers,
Ehsan

Zack Rogers developed a module for Python (IES_gensky.py) that is part of
SPOT and updates the gensky model.

I also seem to remember that in one of the early Radiance workshops there
was a reference to an updated CIE sky generator that could produce all 15
standard sky models. I don't think it ever got a public release but the
source files were exchenged off-list now and then.

Hello again,

As promised, here are some more images of my box bollard.  Definitions 
first:
'closed' ... actual 6-sided box, as generated by ie2rad
'open'  ...  the above, with the top and bottom removed
'open_fixed' ... the above, with a modified source.cal

The light sources in a test room:
http://www.jaloxa.eu/pickup/closed_box_f.jpg
http://www.jaloxa.eu/pickup/open_box_f.jpg
http://www.jaloxa.eu/pickup/open_box_fixed_f.jpg
There is no noticeable difference between 'open' and 'open_fixed'.
Both are slightly different to 'closed'.

Diff images:
$ pcomb -f picdiff.cal closed_box.hdr open_box_fixed.hdr \
 > closed_v_fixed.hdr
etc

http://www.jaloxa.eu/pickup/closed_v_fixed_f.jpg
http://www.jaloxa.eu/pickup/closed_v_open_f.jpg
http://www.jaloxa.eu/pickup/open_v_fixed_f.jpg

'closed_v_open' and 'closed_v_fixed' are identical.  The reason for
this might be that practically all of the light is emitted side-ways,
so that removing the top and bottom of the box makes no difference at
all. Equally, fiddling with source.cal as per Greg's advice

"Regarding the local box correction, you could take out the third term
"noneg(abs(Pz-Dz*Ts)-A4/2)*A2*A3" from the formula:
lboxprojection = (      noneg(abs(Px-Dx*Ts)-A2/2)*A3*A4 +
                        noneg(abs(Py-Dy*Ts)-A3/2)*A2*A4 +
                        noneg(abs(Pz-Dz*Ts)-A4/2)*A2*A3 ) / Ts;"

seemed to give identical results.

Not sure if this provides a general answer to my question, but in my
particular case, it appears to be safe to reduce the box to its four
sides, which probably only works because of the very special
photometry.

Best
Axel

The correction of removing the third term for the local box correction would make the most difference in the upwards and downwards direction, so the sparse output there is why you don't see anything in your falsecolor comparison.

Hi Thomas,

Thank you for the information. I don't have problem with implementing it in
MATLAB or something, but thought would be good to have latest CIE in
gensky. I will do my best to do a comparison of current gensky with the
latest CIE model to see if there is a significant improvement in prediction
or not. if so, why not to update the gensky.

Cheers,
Ehsan

Subject: [Radiance-general] [help] steps on daylight coefficient based
 climate-based daylight metrics calculation
Message-ID: <CABr=F_i_i61W6=xYnQmDLEYyjKehrvUACEZ8qkUieT5+tbZfjg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list,

I wonder if anybody can kindly help to provide a *step-by-step guidance on
how to use Radiance to conduct daylight coefficient based "climate-based
daylight metrics" *such as Daylight Autonomy, Daylight Availability,
Continuous Daylight Autonomy or Useful Daylight Illuminance.

I know that there are several papers explaining the concept and process,
and DIVA-for-Rhino is the tool for this. But I just wan to understand *each
step of the calculation under the hood*.

I want to digest *a breakdown of the process, *maybe in the form of a shell
script file (Unix) or batch file (Windows), which explains each of the key
steps and the Radiance programs and respective parameters used, such as how
daylight coefficient of a given sensor is calculated and by which Radiance
program, when the gendaymtx and rcontrib are used and what are their
functions, and what is generated in each step and how it is used in later
steps, etc.

I have a simple scene prepared describing a simple room with south facing
window and some shading blinds. The scene file, material file and sensor
file are shared in the following link:

Material definitions:
https://sites.google.com/site/thisisthedaviddavidson/files/materials.mat?attredirects=0&d=1

scene description:
https://sites.google.com/site/thisisthedaviddavidson/files/scene.rad?attredirects=0&d=1

sensor file:
https://sites.google.com/site/thisisthedaviddavidson/files/sensor.pts?attredirects=0&d=1

I hope you can give me some guidances using this simple example!

Thank you!

David

Hi David,

I am copying this email to the Radiance-Daysim list as well. There are two  
more streamlined ways to go about this right now: using Daysim or using  
the Radiance three or five-phase methods.

For using Daysim, there is a lot of information I can provide:
- Tutorial from NRCAN:  
http://archive.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/obj/irc/doc/daysim-tutorial (slightly  
updated by Harvard)
- Daysim Documentation page: http://daysim.ning.com/
- A presentation I gave in 2012 on Daysim:  
http://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2012-copenhagen/Day1/Jakubiec/jakubiec,reinhart_radiance-workshop-presentation_daysim.pdf

If you are using DIVA on Windows, there are Daysim batch files you can  
open from the c:\DIVA\Temp\RhinoFileName\ folder after running a  
simulation in order to see how the programs are called.

For the 3/5-phase methods, I am no expert, but a good place to start is  
here,
http://www.radiance-online.org/learning/tutorials/fivephasetutorialfiles/Tutorial-FivePhaseMethod_v2.pdf
Others on the mailing list are highly expert in this.

Best,
Alstan

David

You can start with these two links:

3-Phase-Method:
http://www.radiance-online.org/learning/tutorials/Tutorial-ThreePhaseMethod.pdf

5-Phase-Method:
http://www.radiance-online.org/learning/tutorials/fivephasetutorialfiles/Tutorial-FivePhaseMethod_v2.pdf

Both are written by Andy McNeil who also gives regular comments on
5-phase-method related questions on the mailing list. It's worth to check
the mailing list archives for his posts.

Regards,
Thomas
