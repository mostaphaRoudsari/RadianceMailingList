Hello, 
  i was wondering
  Is there a way to visualize the selected sensor points from Ecotect in the Radiance output?

Hi Niya,

I think you need to be more clear about what you want to visualize? Do you
want to find the sensor in Radiance's files? Is it related to your question
about annual run with Daysim and you want to see hourly values for a single
sensor during the year?

Hi Mostapha, 
  It is kind of you correcting me.
  
  My question concerns only the visual output of the points and their respective values in Radiance image(render).  In short: as the image of the interior is, to see the preselected(from ecotect) sensor point with its value for daylight factor.  
  
best,  Niya

Message-ID: <328512074.96609.1412262805455.JavaMail.apache@nm51.abv.bg>

Hello, 
  I am a student in Vienna and working on a daylight simulation with pipeflow:  IDGB#optics6#window7.2#ecotect2011#grasshopper#radiance#daysim3.1  
  Asking with un unease, since you must also have a tight schedule,  still I need to post two question:  
    What are 
the steps creating double glazing material with coating for Radiance? 
After generating the *.rad files from optics do you manually correct the material in Radiance editor?
  How do I apply optics2glaze with the glazing script in Perl script or would you recommend just the Optics6 export in rad?   
   here is one of the glazing systems:
  1st layer: pane 4mm
     PVB coating 0.78mm     6mm glass pane#cool lite skn 174  22mm Argon 90%  2nd pane : 4mmTn = 64%  (IGDB source)  
  Manufacturer value of the system
     Tn=68%     R(outside)=13%     R(inside)=11%  
  For my understanding tried to compare some values from manufacturer with my Window output - and the discrepancy is too big.  The PVB is missing, though.  
    How would you proceed when you solve this problem elegantly?    
  
  Any comments are highly appreciated.  
  Kind Regards from Vienna,  Niya

I don't know anything about Radiance, but in terms of what you are trying
to model, it appears to be a laminate. You can't model that in WINDOW. You
need to model it in Optics and then import it into the WINDOW Glass Library
as a monolithic layer. There are detailed instructions about how to do this
on our WINDOW Knowledge Base.

first link called Laminate Procedures.

Thank you Robin for writing back, 
  I am reading that a coating touching an interlayer is not possible in Optics5.  I am using Optics6 yet I could not find within the IGDB a PVB coating.  How do you solve such cases?  
  The system Im working on is:  
 1st layer: pane 4mm

It is true that you cannot model a coated layer next to an interlayer in
optics. But you will not get good results trying to model a laminate in
WINDOW.

         I don't know anything about Radiance, but in terms of what you are trying to model, it appears to be a laminate. You can't model that in WINDOW. You need to model it in Optics and then import it into the WINDOW Glass Library as a monolithic layer. There are detailed instructions about how to do this on our WINDOW Knowledge Base.

Robin, I need to ask also about Window export setting to Radiance. I have installed Radiance for Window yet, the export from Window7.2 gives me always message that Radiance for Window is missing.  
  How do I proceed?

It is true that you cannot model a coated layer next to an interlayer in optics. But you will not get good results trying to model a laminate in WINDOW.

      Thank you Robin for writing back,
      
      

      
      
      I am reading that a coating touching an interlayer is not possible in Optics5.
      
      
      I am using Optics6 yet I could not find within the IGDB a PVB coating.
      
      
      How do you solve such cases?
      
      
      

      
      
      The system Im working on is:
      
      
      

       
       1st layer: pane 4mm

Subject: [Radiance-general] Higher Resolution BSDF
Message-ID: <DUB128-W68FAAC2E56634085E1B53DFCB90@phx.gbl>

Hello,
I was wondering is there a way to increase the resolution of the output of the BSDF material. I generated an xml file that when light is perpendicular on the surface it behaves in a vertical linear direction using the klem patches, however this is not the case when I simulate it using radiance; the transmitted light has an abnormal behavior with light spots all over the receiving surface.
I was wondering if the problem is in the genBSDF line i wrote or the geometry I created for the bsdf of the geometry  used in the simulation.
Here are some of the points I applied:
1. The genBSDF line:genBSDF.exe -c 16000 filename.rad > newfilename.xml
2.The surface geometry:0.1 x 0.1 x 0.01 [meters]
3. The simulation environment geometry:0.4 x 0.4 x 1 [meters]

There is no simple way to visualize the numeric output from Radiance in an
image. If you are only doing it for a small number of renderings the
simplest way is to use something like PowerPoint or Photoshop to add labels
with arrows to the right locations. If you set up a template this can also
be quite fast.

If you want to visualize a larger number of images you have to use some
home made scripts to make this work. You would first calculate the DF
values for your points and then use psign and pcompos to add text at the
right place in the image. You need to be fairly familiar with your
scripting environment (Bash on Linux, CMD or PowerShell on Windows) to get
this to work. If you are a stranger to the command line ask someone to
assist you with this or you won't see daylight soon (pardon the pun).

You can find excellent information on scripting for Radiance on Axel
Jacob's page:

May I suggest:
?opendx?
or as my friend would say nowadays "Paraview" or "MayaVI"
no need of fancy scripting.
take the output -opv, make the photopic average (if R = G = B just take Rx179).
then with the formatted file containing
x y z value
should be very simple in opendx.
for the others I am not sure but I am told it is also simple.
if you need more help let me know, I am happy to provide further help.
ciao
G

Hi,

I would also do it with OpenDX. Still, another option all within Radiance:

1) pipe the point locations and the corresponding values into rcalc to 
get a falsecolor value corresponding to the photopic average and the 
location as output,

2) use awk to add the string around the numbers to translate this into 
glow (from falsecolor of photopic average) and sphere (from location, 
set radius fixed according to density and size of grid or relative to 
photopic average)

3) render using your favorite raytracer, optionally with all the scene 
geometry switched to gray (xform -m ...) using all the wonderful view 
options

Cheers,
Lars.

          There is no simple way to visualize the numeric output from Radiance in an image. If you are only doing it for a small number of renderings the simplest way is to use something like PowerPoint or Photoshop to add labels with arrows to the right locations. If you set up a template this can also be quite fast. 
          
          
         
 
          
         
          If you want to visualize a larger number of images you have to use some home made scripts to make this work. You would first calculate the DF values for your points and then use psign and pcompos to add text at the right place in the image. You need to be fairly familiar with your scripting environment (Bash on Linux, CMD or PowerShell on Windows) to get this to work. If you are a stranger to the command line ask someone to assist you with this or you won't see daylight soon (pardon the pun).

Hi Mostapha, 
             
            
 
             
            
             It is kind of you correcting me.
 
             
             
            
 
             
            
             My question concerns only the visual output of the points and their respective values in Radiance image(render). 
             
            
             In short: as the image of the interior is, to see the preselected(from ecotect) sensor point with its value for daylight factor.

                 I think you need to be more clear about what you want to visualize? Do you want to find the sensor in Radiance's files? Is it related to your question about annual run with Daysim and you want to see hourly values for a single sensor during the year?

 Hello Lars,  
  thank you for the break down. I am working now on both options you and G shared with me.Really curious of the outcome.  Will post a feedback soon!  
  Best,  Niya

   Hi,
   
 
   
 I would also do it with OpenDX. Still, another option all within Radiance:
   
 
   
 1) pipe the point locations and the corresponding values into rcalc to get a falsecolor value corresponding to the photopic average and the location as output,
   
 
   
 2) use awk to add the string around the numbers to translate this into glow (from falsecolor of photopic average) and sphere (from location, set radius fixed according to density and size of grid or relative to photopic average)
   
 
   
 3) render using your favorite raytracer, optionally with all the scene geometry switched to gray (xform -m ...) using all the wonderful view options
   
 
   
 Cheers,
   
 Lars.
   
 
    
     May I suggest: 
    
    ?opendx?
     
    
    or as my friend would say nowadays "Paraview" or "MayaVI"
     
    
    no need of fancy scripting.
     
    
    take the output -opv, make the photopic average (if R = G = B just take Rx179).
     
    
    then with the formatted file containing
     
    
    x y z value
     
    
    should be very simple in opendx.
     
    
    for the others I am not sure but I am told it is also simple.
     
    
    if you need more help let me know, I am happy to provide further help.
     
    
    ciao

Hi Niya,

I assume you are using Georg Mischler's "dxf2rad" tool (http://www.schorsch.com/en/download/dxf2rad/). From the instructions:

dxf2rad input.dxf output.rad

So your command would want to look like this (I wouldn't bother with a batch file for this):

dxf2rad solid.dxf solid.rad

Note the lack of a redirect caret (">"), and the use of the filename without the full path. Obviously this means you should run the command from the directory containing your source dxf file. The dxf2rad program should be somewhere on your system's search path for this to work.

Hope this helps!

- Rob

 Hello,
    
  Could you, please, give me some advice on what are the normal requirements for obtaining results in Radiance and Daysim.
  Also what graphic card you would advice me?  I saw the CUDA 6.0 requirement on Radiance blog. Would that be enough for DGP and Radiance RAD Luminance(for instance) calculation?  
  #my student computer reads like that:  
  I am triggering with a file from Ecotect 2011 39MB on a
  Windows System, i5-2400 @2.5GHz  RAM:4GB  and ?appr.40GB free space  
  yet the DGP simulation takes at least 20 hours. -eventough i?m exporting only 10-12 sensor pts.  i believe there is some ground-snoozing in my equipment and it could go faster,no?  
  Any advice is greatly appreciated,  
  Best,  Niya

Subject: [Radiance-general] Image mapping photos to the skydome
Message-ID: <03C6E4397401E049BB24420FF0DA35C3274BE79C@AMXExMb01.global.arup.com>

I'm interested in mapping a photo of an exterior site to a Radiance sky to make the interior renderings more realistic/interesting.  One of the objectives is to demonstrate how the visibility to the exterior scene changes with different types of glass (as exported from LBNLWindow), depending on tint, vlt, and interior reflection.  This is why having a realistic exterior scene is more compelling than whatever simplistic scene I would be able to model myself.

The only way I know of is to take a horizontal fisheye view from a rooftop and map it to the sky dome.  Are there any other methods that people have used?  Ideally ones that didn't require a fisheye camera lens?

Thanks,
Galen

Galen,
If you know the camera lens angle of view you can simply use a rectangle at a distance.
You need the location in 3d of your POW when you take the photo.
Alternatively you could stitch a series of views to make a fisheye projection (for example with 'hugging?) or even better a cylindrical one.
Let me know if you need more on this
G

Hi all, I am assessning DF levels in a 4th floor of a building in an unobstructed area, so I am not considering any surrounding building just a ground plane that I modeled as a circle.Almost by chance I discovered increasing the size of my ground plane has a significant effect on my DF. Using a ground plane of 500m radius I had an average of 3.34%, if I increase it to 1000meters I get over 12%. As long as I understand, this should not have such a big effect, should it? Could I be doing something wrong? Can I do something to make sure I get reasonable values?I am running the simulation though DIVA for Rhino in Grasshopper. My radiance parameters are: -ab 7 -ad 2048 -as 1024 -ar 256 -aa 0.1. My ground plane reflectance is 0.25. Thanks in advance, Alejandro

Hi

Are you sure you have also modelled the "infinite" ground plane as a glowing source ? This has to be modelled even if you also put a large disk for the ground plane.

Hello
Rapha?l, 
  by means of glowing source, I assume the reflectance is less than the normal floorForLighting Material.  Should 20% as a setting for the ?nfinite ground plane be fit?

Hi,
Another possibility is that the larger ground plane is increasing the interpolation distance and you are getting more values from outside spilled in the calculation. You could try increasing ar or reducing aa to see if it converges. (provided that you have the infinite source, as Raphael says)

Greetings,

DIVA automatically includes the 'infinite ground' source in its  
calculations. I also suspect that increasing your ar setting will help  
stabilize your results.

Best,

All the tools I'm aware of include this distant ground source automatically. Santiago is right, the issue here is your huge local ground plane and consequently relatively low -ar value. For a single story building, the rule of thumb is your ground plane plan projection should be about 5x the window head height. With that, even your current -ar of 256 should be adequate to avoid these interpolation errors.

Hi Radiance community,

Anybody else has issue running pcond in recent versions of Radiance? Here
is the error.

*pcond: error reading from pfilt process in fovimage*

I still have the older version of Radiance (4.2..a) also installed which
has no problem with the same image.

Here is one of the images which fails. Cloudy sky for Denver:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/f47p292vxe0ivql/CIE_cloudySky_sky_6_21%40900_radAnalysis_skyView.HDR?dl=0

Try pcond -h to reproduce the error.

Thanks,
Mostapha

I couldn't reproduce the error under MacOS X.  Did you try shortening the file name?

Hi Mostapha,

I've noticed this issue with some images on the latest Radiance 4.2  
versions as well.

Greg, the length of the file name doesn't seem to have any effect for me  
-- the errors remain the same. I've been ignoring the problem, so haven't  
traced the reason as for why it occurs, but it tends to manifest itself  
with Radiance images generated in certain atypical ways: (1) HDR  
photographs and (2) renderings using electric lighting via IES2Rad.

Here is another (very basic) rendering which has the same problem on  
Windows: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3175325/pcond_error.pic

Best,
Alstan

Hi Greg,

Just tested and shortening the file name doesn't help. It gives the same
error. Sorry that I forget to mention that I am running Radiance on Windows.

Thanks,
Mostapha

Hi,
it must be a Windows problem.
no problems using mac or linux (head-release 3 weeks ago).

Well, pfilt hasn't changed in 4 years and pcond hasn't changed in 8, so my only remaining guess is that the new way we're calling popen() under Windows is somehow at fault.  This call that was hand-written by Georg Mischler was recently replaced under Microsoft's Visual-C compiler, and I think the issue is that I'm not explicitly setting the binary file type in pcond.  Schorsch's win_popen() must have done this for me without my realizing it.

I have checked in the new module and it should get recompiled at some point.  My apologies, and I hope this solves the issue.

In the short term, just use the older version of pcond.  It's the same, anyway.

Cheers,
-Greg

fyi in case anyone was trying to pipe falsecolor / gencumulativesky-generated
pics
through pfilt lately, the same error seemed to occur in this scenario - glad
it'll be cleared up :)

Umm...  maybe not.  This is specific to pcond -- I didn't find a similar oversight in any of the other programs.  Can you tell me what command(s) are giving your errors, exactly?

Thanks!

I just built pond with Greg's latest checkin.

Schorsch's win_popen() must have done this for me without my realizing it.

I have checked in the new module and it should get recompiled at some point.  My apologies, and I hope this solves the issue.

In the short term, just use the older version of pcond.  It's the same, anyway.

Hi,
it must be a Windows problem.
no problems using mac or linux (head-release 3 weeks ago).

Hi Radiance community,

Anybody else has issue running pcond in recent versions of Radiance? Here is the error.

pcond: error reading from pfilt process in fovimage

I still have the older version of Radiance (4.2..a) also installed which has no problem with the same image.

Here is one of the images which fails. Cloudy sky for Denver: https://www.dropbox.com/s/f47p292vxe0ivql/CIE_cloudySky_sky_6_21%40900_radAnalysis_skyView.HDR?dl=0

Try pcond -h to reproduce the error.

Yeah so that's not terribly useful info without this link:

https://www.dropbox.com/s/n9m921k4gvgggzj/pcond.exe?dl=0

In my defense, Outlook seems to default to sending the email when you press "return" 2x quickly ? which is, like, idiotic.

Anyhoo, Windows users, please grab the copy of pcond.exe found at the above link and test it out, and report success/failure on this here frequency.

You aren't feeding the output of falsecolor into pcond, are you?  Because that doesn't make sense.

Hmm. Actually I do give the user the option to do it for any HDR image
including falsecolor images! In this case I was just testing to see if it
fails but in general I need to modify the workflow and make sure to give a
warning for falsecolor images. Thanks for the note. I really appreciate it.
Will get it fixed soon. - Mostapha

I'll try to reproduce the error again when in front of the work machine and let
you know- if I recall correctly I just fed a DIVA-generated HDR (from a
rpict+gencumulativesky run) to pfilt, and it wouldn't eat it. Could not figure
that one out.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Unmet Hours-- A new Q+A resource for building
	energy modeling
Message-ID: <CAOG8z52GvC-RLA_kn6kJGT0umKXnU4Jvo_SBQ3FUnyEiyXtNtA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Radiance community,

IBPSA-USA <http://ibpsa.us/> and Big Ladder Software
<http://bigladdersoftware.com/> are pleased to announce a new, free online
community resource called Unmet Hours (https://unmethours.com/), a
question-and-answer (Q+A) website for building energy modelers.

What is a question-and-answer website? It?s a new type of resource that has
emerged from the programming world as an alternative to mailing lists or
forums. But it?s super simple. You ask a question. Other modelers answer
it. The best answer gets voted to the top. Or you can search on your topic
and you might find that your question has already been asked and answered.
And it?s always good to give back to the community (while showing off your
expertise and earning good ?karma?) by helping other modelers with their
questions.

At Unmet Hours, you can ask questions about any modeling topic or software
tool, including Radiance
<https://unmethours.com/questions/scope:all/sort:activity-desc/tags:radiance/page:1/>.
Numerous experts are standing by, eager to help, and ready to answer your
questions--big or small. There are already more than 240 registered users,
more than 90 questions, and more than 170 answers on the website.

Unmet Hours offers many capabilities that make it a powerful resource for
the building energy modeling community:


   -

   Each individual question is kept together with its answers on one web
   page that can be easily referenced with a unique URL.
   -

   Answers are peer reviewed and voted on by the community to reach a
   consensus on which ones are most likely to be helpful or ?correct?.
   -

   Questions are easily searchable on the website. All content is indexed
   by Google and other search engines.
   -

   Questions are tagged with category labels such as ?infiltration
   <https://unmethours.com/questions/scope:all/sort:activity-desc/tags:infiltration/page:1/>?,
   ?daylighting
   <https://unmethours.com/questions/scope:all/sort:activity-desc/tags:daylighting/page:1/>?,
   or ?radiance
   <https://unmethours.com/questions/scope:all/sort:activity-desc/tags:radiance/page:1/>?
   making it easy to find topics of interest.
   -

   Questions can be tagged across multiple categories for cross-cutting
   problems, for example, ?ashrae-90.1
   <https://unmethours.com/questions/scope:all/sort:activity-desc/tags:ashrae-90.1/page:1/>?,
   ?hvac
   <https://unmethours.com/questions/scope:all/sort:activity-desc/tags:hvac/page:1/>?,
   and ?openstudio
   <https://unmethours.com/questions/scope:all/sort:activity-desc/tags:openstudio/page:1/>
   ?.
   -

   Tags or individual questions can be ?followed? to receive email updates
   when there is new or changed content. You control your email update
   preferences.
   -

   Comments are used to discuss or make suggestions about a question or
   answer without distracting from the main content.
   -

   All content is actively moderated and curated by the community.
   Questions and answers can be revised at any time to be clearer and more
   helpful, or to be updated as new information becomes available. It?s a
   living knowledge base.
   -

   And it all works conveniently in the web browser on your smartphone!


You can find Unmet Hours at https://unmethours.com/ It?s a resource for the
building energy modeling community, built by the community. We are counting
on your support and participation to continue its success.

Dear all,
I'm currently working with a glazing manufacturer who is providing me with 
glazing properties in .is and .brdf files.
I've used xml files previously in Radiance to work with BSDF primitives 
and I wondered if some of you have ever come across these extensions and 
knew if they can be converted into a readable format by Radiance.
Thanks in advance,

I wonder if I could ask if it is possible to use Radiance to assess the albedo of an urban setting, e.g. a street gorge, where Radiance can take into account the near infra-red component of the solar spectrum as well as the visible one, please? Perhaps the visible component would have to be assessed first, and then the IR on a second run, after modifying the surface reflectances? Could Radiance be used like that?

Richard,

I would say you can. I often use Radiance for assessing the solar
properties of shading systems.

However, you will have to consider that (I am speaking in VERY general,
some of these might not apply):

-   Radiance uses only geometric optics. I have no idea what happens to
diffraction when wavelengths get longer... but that effect will not be
considered.
-   Some materials will be opaque in some wavelengths and transparent in
others (i.e. glass), so the material properties might change a lot.
-   If you get to very long wavelengths, some hot surfaces might even
become emitters. I guess that in order to get to this you will need VERY
hot surfaces; so for albedo it might not apply.
-   At least in my cases, I assume the materials to be gray (i.e. have the
same optical properties for the whole range). This might not apply for VERY
long spectrums. To solve this, you might want to split into some more bands
than only IR and Visible. As a start, you can use the basic three channels
for three different bands.
-   Will you need to change the sky and sun's definition, wouldn't you?

I hope it helps!

Super great, I'll give it a go and hope it makes it into the new distros/builds.
I sent the "un-pfilt-able" image to Greg and will let you know what he makes of
it.

Subject: [Radiance-general] can't get the PATH,
	RAYPATH and MANPATH set correctly
Message-ID: <CAGhWmF50acwESDu5AQHWUuoMKuxwOBesCXUR5-qYjTG9+ijr+w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, I don't seem to be able to get the my Radiance environment variable set
correctly after the following steps:

1. install the latest Radiance 4.2.1 for Mac which is installed to the
*/usr/local/radiance* folder.

2. use *"**pico ~/.profile*" to edit *.profile* and add the following lines:


*export PATH=/usr/local/radiance/bin:$PATHexport
RAYPATH=.:/usr/local/radiance/libexport MANPATH=/usr/local/radiance/man*

However, when I type "which gensky" in the terminal, it still points me to
the path of gensky in a different location: "/usr/local/bin" where copies
of some Radiance programs are put previously.

I wonder why the editing of .profile didn't work in this case even if I
restarted my computer ...

So, can I have some advices on how to:
1. clear up earlier copies of Radiance programs
2. do a clean installation of Radiance
3. and set its environmental variables correctly?

Thanks!

Hi,

I guess you should use sudo before pico. cuz without sudo you cant save the .profile

Hi, Ehsan, yes, I also tried using "*sudo pico ~/.profile*", but the
problem is still the same:

No feedback when I typied "which gensky" in terminal, although it is in the
folder /usr/local/radiance/bin ...

Any advices?

I guess its better to cleanup all the radiance files from bin and install
it from scratch! I assume you used the link below:
http://www.radiance-online.org/download-install/installation-information

Hope this help.

Hi, Ehsan, yes, I also tried using "*sudo pico ~/.profile*", but the
problem is still the same:

No feedback when I typied "which gensky" in terminal, although it is in the
folder /usr/local/radiance/bin ...

Any advices?

I guess its better to cleanup all the radiance files from bin and install
it from scratch! I assume you used the link below:
http://www.radiance-online.org/download-install/installation-information

Hope this help.

Having Radiance in /usr/local/bin as well as /usr/local/radiance/bin can be problematic, even with a tightly configured environment. Your initial change to .profile *should* have worked though, i.e., "which gensky" should have found the one in /usr/local/radiance/bin. My guess is you didn't source ~/.profile or start a new terminal window before trying the "which" command. Or maybe the order the way you have it there is wrong. Personally I start with the existing path and append /usr/local/radiance/bin to that. I'm with Ehsan, you may want to start clean (unfortunately there's no clean way to uninstall Radiance), reinstall, and add the following to your environment (personally I make these changes to ~/.bash_profile):

## Radiance path crap
export PATH=$PATH:.:/usr/local/radiance/bin
export RAYPATH=.:/usr/local/radiance/lib
export MANPATH=$MANPATH:/usr/local/radiance/doc

I wonder why the editing of .profile didn't work in this case even if I restarted my computer ...

So, can I have some advices on how to:
1. clear up earlier copies of Radiance programs
2. do a clean installation of Radiance
3. and set its environmental variables correctly?

Thank you, Rob and Ehsan!

Yes, I also found out just now that I may need to add *". ~/.profile"* into
my *"~/.bash_profile" *file using pico if the Radiance path variables are
specified in ~/.profile.

Anyway, I'll take note of your suggestion of specifying the variables in
~/.bash_profile *directly* next time I install Radiance from top after I
reinstall my OS.

Much obliged!

Also for troubleshooting try the command "type -a gensky" to show not just the path to which version of the executable floats to the top of your PATH variable, but will show all the locations of the executable in any possible paths defined in PATH. As Rob said, your PATH variable may be out of order and it's finding the one you don't want first.

Just following up on the earlier issue Max was having with pfilt on Windows.  It is unrelated to the pcond issue, and appears to be a shell issue.  I've never heard of the "Power Shell" before, but it seems best avoided with Radiance, or anything that sends binary data to stdout.

Cheers,

Thank you very much, Christopher, for this very handy skill!

All the suggestions above go into my "Radiance Bible"!

Dear All,

 

I would to do a daylight simulation for CFS using the 3M redirecting film.

 

The link below is a presentation from the 2012 Radiance workshop, slides
15-18 show  the possible options we are trying to achieve.

 

http://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2012-copenhagen/Day2/Basu

Can anyone point me in the right direction where I can find the BTDF file or
function file (.cal) for the 3M prismatic film?

Hello,

I am not sure about this, but some time ago I found these:

http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/29946/files/Integration%20of%20BT(R)DF%20Data%20into%20Radiance%20Lighting%20Simulation%20Programme.pdf?version=1&origin=publication_detail

http://escholarship.org/uc/item/52b7990w

I do not really know hoy to model the 3M fil, but I guess you can contact
the authors. My understanding is that prism2 material is used instead of a
BSDF.

Hope it helps!

Germ?n

As far as I know, there is no BSDF (or BTDF/BRDF) for this film. It is totally measurable in LBL's goniophotometer, though, as it's a nice small and thin material.

Bayanda,
We've characterized some products from 3M and they have an imaging sphere
for characterizing products themselves. I'd suggest you ask them for data,
that way you're sure to get the most recent version of their products.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance compilation errors
Message-ID: <CAGhWmF4+_19xHEabO9s_3PjBOxCsVNNhrH=GkHXg=Pkcf+bkrg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list,

I got some errors while compiling the latest Radiance4.3.a.1 on a Macbook
Pro (OS X Yosemite).

There was a post before saying that "clang" related warnings are still
tolerable. But I just don't know why there are "errors" generated,
especially considering this is a "clean" installation after I reinstall and
update the OS, Xcode 6, command line tools and X11 ... So, hope you can
advise!

The entire installation log is shown in the following Google Doc file, and
the warnings or errors as assumed by myself are highlighted, too:
*https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CqIIHEkg3uIr1oOMr2bWg2J24XShzFAVsqcgQwZYURM/edit?usp=sharing
<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CqIIHEkg3uIr1oOMr2bWg2J24XShzFAVsqcgQwZYURM/edit?usp=sharing>*

Thank you in advance!

Thanks, Joe.  

This probably belongs on the "dev" mailing list, so will cross-post there and you can sign up and respond on that list if you don't mind.

None of these warnings generated the "There were some errors." conclusion at the end.  This was caused by a failed "clean" operation that didn't matter on the TIFF library:

cd tiff; make distclean
/bin/sh: line 0: cd: tiff: No such file or directory
make[1]: *** No rule to make target `distclean'.  Stop.
make: *** [clean] Error 2

Nevertheless, it was helpful to see some of these warnings, particularly the "implicit declaration" issues, which I needed to fix.  There was also a genuine bug in the ezxml code, which was likely never triggered as it had to do with an unused attribute types extension.  I fixed that one as well, even though it isn't really my code.

Cheers,
-Greg

As far as I know, there is no BSDF (or BTDF/BRDF) for this film. It is
totally measurable in LBL's goniophotometer, though, as it's a nice small
and thin material.

You can contact 3M directly for the BSDF files of the Daylight Film.  I have
done this on a project recently.

Bayanda,
We've characterized some products from 3M and they have an imaging sphere
for characterizing products themselves. I'd suggest you ask them for data,
that way you're sure to get the most recent version of their products.

Folks

Is there a way to know the progress of the rcontrib run? I am creating
images with rcontrib, and all I can see is the 2000+ images being updated
every now and then, without knowing when is this going to end.

Thanks

Ery

You can look at the length of each output file as an indicator of percent completion.  A 1920x1080 picture file will be approximately 1920x1080x4 bytes long when finished.  

Hope this helps.

Dear Bayanda,

Please find in the ZIP below some infos on the Film 3M used by Chantal
Basurto in her PhD thesis completed this month (soon to be online on
infoscience.epfl.ch) together with a monitored BSDF file from LESO-PB
goniophotometer at EPFL:

ftp://kaemco.synology.me/Geronimo/3M_prismatic_film.zip

You can also download Geronimo version 1.2, which is an easy tool to
simulate CFS with monitored BSDF:

ftp://kaemco.synology.me/Geronimo/Geronimo_v1.2.zip

Hope this helps,
Jerome

He knows too much, and must be eliminated!

You are correct Rob, for normal picture output.  However, rcontrib (and rtrace) don't apply run-length encoding to their output due to the way the programs are structured, so the simple calculation method works.

To apply the same trick to rpict output, you would have to run it through pfilt and see what it tells you in terms of %age complete.

Cheers,
-Greg

Hello Thomas

I managed to import rtrace illuminance values back into Sketchup via
su2rad, see the picture:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/6h2rfc1odxzh3xu/su2rad_import.png?dl=0

However, su2rad creates 3D contour (see the cones in the picture). Is there
a way to have a 2D (line) contour? I presume that should be easier than
triangulation process to create 3D contour.

Thanks!

Ery

Congrats! Nice model, btw.

The generation of the contour lines depends on the 3d "topography" of the
imported data. I use the SketchUp "intersect" function to slice the 3d
shape into bands. The resulting edges are the contour lines you see. I'm
sure there are better and more direct ways of generating the contours but
in 2008/2009 SketchUp's API was not that advanced. Today it may be feasible
to implement an alternative using a Ruby library.

Anyway: you can just scale the 3d map to an almost flat plane or use one of
the SU plugins to flatten the geometry. I never tried it with the su2rad
import but I'm using the "Flatten" plugin by Thomas Thomason regularly on
CAD imports.

Regards,
Thomas

Thanks Thomas,

My student suggested a much simpler method: leave the 3D contour alone,
just change the camera setting. Top view, parallel projection. Works for me!

Thanks for developing su2rad!

Message-ID: <CAGhWmF42zw-caouoi9BXvnz2-P8ve6wERS7p355Ur-MpT5=r9w@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all, I got a warning when using findglare to process a hdr image file:

*findglare: warning -- missing 1% of samples*

And the ugr value produced by glarendx using the .glr file generated in the
previous step is zero.

May I ask why the hdr image, which looks fine in Photomatix, is causing
findglare error?

The HDR image is shared in the following link:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_FMUh4Urmx4dzZoYVNkSEVzNzQ/view?usp=sharing

Thanks!

findglare cannot resolve the sun in that image, not sure how to overcome 
this. increasing -r doesn't help.

why are you evaluating such a scene with UGR? UGR doesn't make sense for 
very small glare sources and also not for daylight situations.

As far as I know, for exterior spaces no established glare rating exist.

You could use evalglare (version 12) instead and look for the CIE 
veiling glare index (-d option, last index printed), gives you the 
veiling luminance in the eye according to the cie disability glare 
equation. This option is pretty new in evalglare, so if you use it, pls 
check it against hand calculation and report any problem... I checked it 
only quickly when implementing.
I also wouldn't use DGP for exterior spaces.

good luck

Jan
