Subject: [Radiance-general] Frit Glass trans Paramters
Message-ID: <CAPGcXuf4xG_EcZx8fQEM5RSOx2z5L183oWhSk8ivqw4PUPxagg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I am trying to model frit glass with varying percentage( 20% to 60%)  of
silk screen coverage(dots)  using trans material to compare illuminance
levels and glare. I am using DIVA for Rhino simulation interface for
Radiance simulation. I am representing the glass as a single surface in the
model.

I am struggling to come up with the Transmitted specularity(Ts), Diffuse
Transmission(Td) , Reflected specularity(Rs) and the Diffuse reflectance
(Cr, Cg,Cb) , so as to calculate the A1 to A7 trans material values.

Any suggestion or pointers on how to estimate or get the above values?

for example, I have the following frit glass assembly with 60% coverage
that I pulled form glass manufacture website.

1/4" (6mm) clear VE-85 #2 and 60% Coverage V175 #2

1/2" (13.2mm) argon space

1/4" (6mm) clear


Appreciate your help!


Best,

Aditya,

Trans isn't really a great option for modeling glazing with frit since the
transmission properties don't change with angle. I'd recommend using the
glaze script that comes with Radiance to build up your glazing material.
You simply type 'glaze' at the command line and follow the prompts. the
internal demo database already has the V175 frit.

Jack de Valpine gave a presentation describing how to use glaze to build up
an IGU. And how to use data from LBNL optics to add entries to your glaze
database (slide 10). He has the low-e coating you're proposing on slide 10,
so you might be able to just copy it into your local database.

Hi Andy,

This seems as good a time as any. I put together a blog post about Glass 
in Radiance <http://modsimvis.blogspot.com/>. I need to add some 
information about the optics2rad script but have not gotten around to 
it. But it may be a helpful resource as the topic (glaze) does seem to 
come up.

Best,

-Jack

Andy/Jack,

Thank for providing great resource. I am tying to follow to the process
outlined and have couple of more questions:

1) Since I am using radiance using DIVA for Rhino( Windows operating
system), it creates a Radiance folder with in the DIVA folder. I navigated
to the radiance folder via command prompt window and tried to call for "
glaze" it gave error as glaze is not recognized. I have even installed the
Radiance versions 4.3.a.2 for win32.exe that I downloaded form NREL
radiance releases. Is there a command error ?

2) The "lib" folder under both Radiance folders has only glaze.1cal( single
pane fritted) and glaze2.cal(double pane fritted) files , there is no
"glaze" file are these the same as glaze file?

2) does the example work flow example in the website use unix or cygwin, if
so do i need to install cygwin? and is there specific version of radiance
that i need to install ?

4) can I not execute glaze and optics2glazedb via windows?

3) Should the "optics2glazedb" file put in a specific location and where
does the generated database get written to. Also, what is the file
extension for optics2glazedb ?

Appreciate your help and input.

Regards,

Aditya

Hi Aditya,

Unfortunately, the glaze and other script is a csh script, so it has to 
be run under unix/linux...

Aditya,

Well, shoot. Glaze is one of the few remaining c-shell scripts, which means
it won't run in DOS. Yes, you could install CGWIN. But, to save you the
hassle I've run it using the parameters you gave and the database from
Jack's blog (thanks Jack!). Though I put the frit on surface 3, because
glaze won't let you use a frit and low-e coating on the same surface. I
don't really know what effect putting the frit on surface 3 vs. underneath
the low-e on surface 2 has, but I'd guess you're much better off than had
you used a simple trans material. The BRTDfunc material definition is at
the very end of the text copied below.

hope this helps,
Andy

Subject: [Radiance-general] Modeling UV Radiation with Radiance
Message-ID: <CAAd_PgSE+4n-Pj_nZedkKexMqA0nhvc6mdh=LixbgFWeeBw-=w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm trying to understand the possibilities of modeling UV radiation using
Radiance. I found this previous discussion on email list (
http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2011-July/007983.html)
but I'm not still clear about the whole workflow. I break up the question
into 3:

1. Is it possible to generate the sky just for UV radiation? or is it
possible to generate the sky for an specific wavelength range? I understand
that gendaylit does provide the full spectrum but how can can I filter out
the values for UV?

2. In case I can generate the filtered sky (question 1), does it effect the
Radiance calculation for light transmittance? I assume as far as I input
the correct number (UV transmittance) the calculation should be accurate.

3. Can/should I use BSDF materials in this case? Does BSDF materials
include information for UV wavelength? and how does this will work with the
sky (question 1). As an alternate method, and in case I can't filter the
sky, I was thinking to modify BSDF material and make it opaque for all the
wave-lengths except UV?

Thanks in advance,
Mostapha

Subject: [Radiance-general] Rtrace for Radiance & Irradiance Calc.
Message-ID: <AE55A995167B224DBBFA16500E3AB9B3047C1283@NDJSMBX202.ndc.nasa.gov>

Hello Dear Radiance Users,
            I have some questions about the utilization of rtrace to determine radiance & irradiance values within a scene. I greatly appreciate your responses and help. To give some context, I'm working on developing a virtual gonio-photometer in Radiance in order to obtain BRDFs of Radiance primitive materials and then export the BRDF data for analysis with other software. To do this I need a clear understanding of how Radiance measures radiance and irradiance with rtrace. First, I will explain my current methodology and please correct me if I'm wrong at any point.
            A BRDF is a ratio of the reflected radiance of a material over the incident irradiance on the material surface, and this value is evaluated over four spherical angle ranges that define the orientation of the incident light and the orientation of the reflected light as captured by a radiance meter.
            The units of a BRDF value is (1/steradian), since the units of radiance are (W*m^2/sr.) and the units of irradiance are (W*m^2). Also, radiance is independent of measurement distance unlike irradiance. Due to this the BRDF geometry is constrained to a unit meter hemisphere, with the material sample centered at the origin.
            To compute the incident irradiance on the material sample I use rtrace with -I argument. I pass the position (0,0,0), the center of the material sample and the direction (x,y,z) that is a unit vector aligned with the optical axis of the light source that points to the center of the light source (ring surface). I'll call this irradiance value L1.
            A second way to compute the incident irradiance is to use rtrace with the -i argument and pass position (x,y,z), the position of the light source, and direction (-x,-y,-z) that points toward the origin, which is the center of the sample. I'll call this irradiance value L2.
            After looking at the irradiance values it seems like L2 is the Lambert's cosine corrected irradiance, meaning L2 = L1*cos(theta), where theta is the radial incident angle of the light source. Is this true? If not, can someone please explain the difference between these two irradiance measurements?
            Also, in the rtrace help page could someone help explain this statement that concerns the -i argument: "This only affects the final result, substituting a Lambertian surface and multiplying the radiance by pi." I understand that a Lambertian surface is one that is purely diffuse and the radiance and luminance is constant in all directions, but I'm unsure of how this applies to irradiance.
            Finally, I need to obtain reflected radiance from the material, and I want to make sure that my radiance measurement doesn't take into account the radiance emanating from the light source itself. To do this, given an arbitrary radiance meter positon along the unit hemisphere (x,y,z). I setup rtrace with no input arguments other than position (x,y,z) and direction (-x,-y,-z), a unit vector that points to the center of the material (0,0,0), from the radiance meter position (x,y,z).
            My problem arises when I evaluate the BRDF at various locations. I see a radiance value that is about 3x-4x larger than my measured incident irradiance value, at the position of the specular reflection (mirror-like reflection). Of course, I will see the highest reflected radiance at the specular position, however it seems to be unrealistically large, since somehow more energy is reflected than emanating from the single light source itself. Is this type of behavior common for a metal Radiance primitive that follows the Ward BRDF scattering model? With my current observations, the conservation of energy is not maintained. Do I need to correct the radiance value by a steradian value to be able compare the two as apples to apples? Or am I missing something else.
            I apologize for the long message, but I wanted to be as clear as possible with my questions. Thank you in advance for your time and help.

Best Regards,
Andrei Kolomenski

Nasa? Awesome... haha.

Anyway, I did not really finished reading, but I have some questions

   1. Radiance already has a virtual photogoniometer... genBSDF program.
   easy yo use and, I would say, very optimized. Why is that you do not want
   to use it?
   2. Radiance also has some programs that allow you to give a BSDF
   "function" into a BSDF matrix or tensor tree: bsdf2klems, bsdf2tensortree,
   or something like that.

Were you aware of this? is there a reason not to use them?

Best,

Germ?n

Hello,

Thank you for the response. Yes I do know of these programs (genBSDF,bsdf2kelms,bsdf2tensortree). But we need our own version because I need direct control of exporting BRDF data, also I want a clear understanding how rtrace should be used for radiance and irradiance measurements. My question is directed toward the proper use of rtrace.

Andrei Kolomenski

Nasa? Awesome... haha.
Anyway, I did not really finished reading, but I have some questions

  1.  Radiance already has a virtual photogoniometer... genBSDF program. easy yo use and, I would say, very optimized. Why is that you do not want to use it?
  2.  Radiance also has some programs that allow you to give a BSDF "function" into a BSDF matrix or tensor tree: bsdf2klems, bsdf2tensortree, or something like that.

Were you aware of this? is there a reason not to use them?

Best,

Germ?n

Hello Dear Radiance Users,
            I have some questions about the utilization of rtrace to determine radiance & irradiance values within a scene. I greatly appreciate your responses and help. To give some context, I?m working on developing a virtual gonio-photometer in Radiance in order to obtain BRDFs of Radiance primitive materials and then export the BRDF data for analysis with other software. To do this I need a clear understanding of how Radiance measures radiance and irradiance with rtrace. First, I will explain my current methodology and please correct me if I?m wrong at any point.
            A BRDF is a ratio of the reflected radiance of a material over the incident irradiance on the material surface, and this value is evaluated over four spherical angle ranges that define the orientation of the incident light and the orientation of the reflected light as captured by a radiance meter.
            The units of a BRDF value is (1/steradian), since the units of radiance are (W*m^2/sr.) and the units of irradiance are (W*m^2). Also, radiance is independent of measurement distance unlike irradiance. Due to this the BRDF geometry is constrained to a unit meter hemisphere, with the material sample centered at the origin.
            To compute the incident irradiance on the material sample I use rtrace with ?I argument. I pass the position (0,0,0), the center of the material sample and the direction (x,y,z) that is a unit vector aligned with the optical axis of the light source that points to the center of the light source (ring surface). I?ll call this irradiance value L1.
            A second way to compute the incident irradiance is to use rtrace with the ?i argument and pass position (x,y,z), the position of the light source, and direction (-x,-y,-z) that points toward the origin, which is the center of the sample. I?ll call this irradiance value L2.
            After looking at the irradiance values it seems like L2 is the Lambert?s cosine corrected irradiance, meaning L2 = L1*cos(theta), where theta is the radial incident angle of the light source. Is this true? If not, can someone please explain the difference between these two irradiance measurements?
            Also, in the rtrace help page could someone help explain this statement that concerns the ?i argument: ?This only affects the final result, substituting a Lambertian surface and multiplying the radiance by pi.? I understand that a Lambertian surface is one that is purely diffuse and the radiance and luminance is constant in all directions, but I?m unsure of how this applies to irradiance.
            Finally, I need to obtain reflected radiance from the material, and I want to make sure that my radiance measurement doesn?t take into account the radiance emanating from the light source itself. To do this, given an arbitrary radiance meter positon along the unit hemisphere (x,y,z). I setup rtrace with no input arguments other than position (x,y,z) and direction (-x,-y,-z), a unit vector that points to the center of the material (0,0,0), from the radiance meter position (x,y,z).
            My problem arises when I evaluate the BRDF at various locations. I see a radiance value that is about 3x-4x larger than my measured incident irradiance value, at the position of the specular reflection (mirror-like reflection). Of course, I will see the highest reflected radiance at the specular position, however it seems to be unrealistically large, since somehow more energy is reflected than emanating from the single light source itself. Is this type of behavior common for a metal Radiance primitive that follows the Ward BRDF scattering model? With my current observations, the conservation of energy is not maintained. Do I need to correct the radiance value by a steradian value to be able compare the two as apples to apples? Or am I missing something else.
            I apologize for the long message, but I wanted to be as clear as possible with my questions. Thank you in advance for your time and help.

Best Regards,
Andrei Kolomenski

I won't try to answer all of your questions, and my answer is based only on reading documentation rather than close knowledge of the actual code... but I'll try to comment related to the difference between the uppercase and lowercase -I and -i options. When using uppercase -I rtrace will inherently offset your x,y,z meter position slightly in the direction of your measurement vector in case you've given a coordinate that is coplanar with the surface (I forget the distance used but with my clues and a little searching this should be found somewhere in the mailing list archives). When using the lowercase -i rtrace will trace a ray along the given vector, calculate the luminance at the point of intersection with a surface, then determine illuminance by correcting the luminance with factors of pi and reflectance at the intersection point. I've never investigated if non-Lambertian materials actually do impact this value, but if so the -I option would better serve your purpose for non-lambertian materials, but you may have to scale your model or edit the code to have the offset of measurement coordinates become negligible.
I wouldn't consider myself an authority on the topic, but I want to try to respond with the hope that others will better explain my understanding if it deserves clarification.

Comments inline, but I agree with the general sentiment that it's simpler (and more accurate) to apply genBSDF and other tools already suited to the purpose.  (Note that the "bsdfquery" program can be used to extract any desired BSDF angles.)  The genBSDF program employs rcontrib, which is much more powerful (and efficient) than using rtrace.  For single materials with no texture and no geometry, what you are doing should work.

You should actually point the direction vector "straight up" along the normal of your surface, not towards the light source.  This is the cause of your discrepancy between L1 and L2.  Illuminance is measured at the surface, and should account for the cosine angle to the light source(s).

Illuminance = Irradiance convolved with Vlambda using a peak efficacy of 683 lumens/watt at 555 nm.  Same for luminance and radiance.

Since the BRDF is a differential quantity, it can evaluate to greater than 1.0.  Theoretically, it can even be infinite if the surface is purely specular, although the integrated value will be less than 100%

Hello,

Thank you for your input. I was not aware of the bsdfquery program, I looked in my Radiance/bin folder & couldn't locate this program in my Windows or Linux installs. I'm using Radiance 4.2. Can you please tell me the location of the bsdfquery program? 

Thank you for explaining the difference between -i & -I rtrace input args. The values L1 and L2 are now equal, and I feel like I have a better understanding of rtrace.

Best Regards,
Andrei Kolomenski

Oops, looks like this one isn't making it into the NREL Radiance

The bsdfquery program is one of a small number of debugging/hacker tools that you have to build manually, since it isn't fully supported.  If you are on a Unix installation, you can use "make bsdfquery bsdf2rad pabopto2rad" in the ray/src/cv directory to build these, then copy the tools to your executable directory.

Cheers,

Dear:

I have the following problem with the Radiance lighting simulation:

I created a climate file from a weather station data. I have the following
parameters:

- Dry bulb temperature
- Dew point temperature
- Relative humidity
- Atmospheric Pressure
- Horizontal infrared radiation from sky
- Global horizontal radiation
- Direct normal radiation
- Diffuse normal radiation
- Visibility

All other data assumed to be zero.

With this weather file, simulation isn't done correctly, so if it happens
if I use a weather file from EnergyPlus database.

What data are required for the simulation, in order to complete my weather
file?

Regards.

I would recommend running a regular epw file through the utility "epw2wea", which takes a weather file from the EnergyPlus database and converts it for use with gendaymtx. This way you can see exactly which subset of information gendaymtx needs, and in what format. It's basically the Daysim weather input format (and it's less info than what you have in your custom weather file there). Your file format is not what gendaymtx expects, and is probably the cause of your troubles.

DesignBuilder USA training registration underway.


Don't miss this opportunity to be trained in the easiest to use/learn, most powerful building energy performance tool available.


DesignBuilder is an elegant, seamless integration of building energy performance tools encompassing the totality of building energy use, including whole building energy simulation, daylighting and internal/external CFD (computational fluid dynamics). Suitable for both residential and commercial applications, DesignBuilder was the first graphical user interface (GUI) to EnergyPlus, the 'gold standard' for whole building energy simulation. With more than ten years of development invested, DesignBuilder is the building energy performance tool of choice for today's architects and engineers.

Developed to simplify the process of building simulation, DesignBuilder allows you to rapidly compare the function and performance of building designs and deliver early stage thru final results on time and on budget. Unlike other products that generate results that are broad and indefinite, or do not address daylighting or airflow and 3-D temperature distribution data in and around buildings, DesignBuilder provides a total solution with data results you can have complete confidence in.

The training will be run using version 4 of DesignBuilder and will cover many of the new and enhanced features such as the new geometric modeler with enhanced block geometry editing, the ability to mirror blocks, add individual surfaces, and produce cut-away/section visualizations. Version 4 can produce ASHRAE 90.1 standards compliant baseline models required of various certification and credit programs including LEED, IRS, etc.

The training is suitable for new and experienced users alike. It is fully modular so that people can attend just one or any number of the days.

The course is organized so that architects could attend only the first 2-3 days and the last 2 days are specific to engineers. The focus on day 3 is low energy and passive design modelling and it would therefore be valuable for both architects and engineers.

Locations & Dates

*	Durham, North Carolina; May 11-15, 2015
*	San Francisco, California; September 21-25, 2015

Discounts are available for students/researchers/faculty and multiple company attendees booking 4 or more days.

Space is limited so we encourage early registration.

Message-ID: <AE55A995167B224DBBFA16500E3AB9B3047C19A3@NDJSMBX202.ndc.nasa.gov>

Hello All,
I?m experiencing a runtime error with oconv when generating an octree file for a model that has about 5 million triangle polygons. This is the error I see:
               oconv: system - out of octree space: Not enough space
I?m using Radiance 4.3a 32 bit on Windows 7 64 bit OS running on a desktop with an i7 and 16 GB of RAM. I tried this on another desktop with a Xeon X5647 with 48 GB of RAM and same error. So hardware resources shouldn?t be the issue. I tried generating the same octree on Linux, and everything worked properly.
I have a similar problem with rpict when rendering an image of a large geometry scene. My octree is 843 MB and I?m testing the model with no lights and only ambient lighting (using ?av 1 1 1). When I run rpict from the command line it either finishes but generates a completely empty image or rpict crashes and I see a ?rpict not responding? Windows message.
Is there a 64 bit Windows installer version of Radiance, or can I build it from source code using CMAKE? What is the maximum number of vertices that 32 bit Radiance can handle? Has anybody else experienced problems with oconv or rpict in Windows when working with large models?

Kind Regards,
Andrei Kolomenski

Hi Andrei,

In theory you should be able to use CMake now with a pre-5.0a vintage (say, https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/tree/4.3.a.2) of the source to try building for 64-bit Windows. I don't know of any publicly-available Win64 Radiance installers. We (NREL) would like to offer them, and that's on the to-do list, but it's a long list.

Daniel,

You should be able to generate the .wea file from diffuse horizontal
radiation and direct normal radiation values. The structure of the lines
after the heading in .wea file is:

month day hour directNormalRadiation diffuseHorizontalRadiation

You can also check Daysim's source code if you have it installed on your
system. You should be able to find it at: "C:\DAYSIM\src\epw2wea\epw2wea.c"

Hi everyone,I have a question about DGP. I want to
assess the DGP at a certain point in my building caused by the fa?ade across the street. What I have done is running the simulation DGP simulation, then setting the
facade as a black body and run it again (this way I account for everything but
the fa?ade). Then I subtracted both results to get the DGP produced by the fa?ade. However, I am
kind of suspecting that DGP is not that simple (since it also considers
factors like contrast) and one cannot operate with it in that way.If so, can someone think of an alternative way to measure glare produced by a certain elemhent?Thanks in advance, Alejandro

This will do two things: (*1*) the -d option will give you a list of all 
contrast-based glare sources, including reflections from your facade; 
(*2*) the -c option will colour the separate contrast-based glare 
sources randomly in the check.hdr file. You can even plug the values 
from 1 into the contrast half of the DGP equation.

Of course running the calculations either with the building as a black 
hole or (more realistically) as not present at all produces some 
comparative value as well.

Best,
Alstan

Oh it's definitely possible, and FYI we are doing it for Mac and Linux
already. These are publicly available:

Linux64
https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/download/5.0.a.1/radiance-5.0.a-L
inux64.tar.gz
https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/download/4.3.a.2/radiance-4.3.a-L

arwin.dmg
https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/download/4.3.a.2/radiance-4.3.a-D
arwin.dmg

I also know folks are successfully building older vintages of Radiance
(4.3a) for 64-bit Windows. We just haven't had the time to get a Windows
build system together to do it here; once we do, they will be posted to
NREL's GitHub site alongside the others.

P.S.
Radiance 5.0a for Windows (32bit) is also a work in progress, which we
hope to have available soon.

Hi Alejandro,

the question is not that easy... Usually you compare two cases and then 
look for the differences (as you want to do)
But the first question is, what is the "reference" you want to compare 
to. A comparison with a black surface is definitely not "fair" - it 
overestimates the influence of the facade. I would rather use a case 
without an opposite building or using one with a diffuse surface (but 
then again, what color do you assume as "reference"... if you are on 
greece islands, this would be white around 70% reflectance, in northern 
Germany red brick around 20% reflectance...). So not to end in 
discussions about a meaningful reference, I would go for the "no 
building" reference. So then you have two cases and you end up with two 
different values, so you can state "the facade causes an increase of the 
DGP by XX compared to an unobstructed view to the surrounding.

If you are dealing with specular reflections of the sun on your facade, 
then you have to be careful to use a larger image size.  (at least 
1200x1200, better 1500x1500 in order to have enough pixels to see the 
reflexion of the sun)- even evalglare is getting very slow. and be 
careful about pixel sampling, jittering settings and the -lw limit.

And just to be sure - don't use any of the existing simplified methods 
to calculate DGP (they are not based on a full rendering), because they 
are based on illuminance calculations using rtrace -I - in that case you 
will miss the specular reflection of the sun (it doesn't matter if it is 
glass, plastic or metal) if you don't use a special material mix on your 
surface containing also the mirror material.

And finally: Be aware, that DGP is just a measure for discomfort glare 
INSIDE a building. It does not include disability glare and is also no 
measure for discomfort glare OUTSIDE a building, where you have much 
higher adaptation levels.

Best,

Jan

I'm confused about Radiance development. In the past I would go to the radiance-online.org site to get the latest release of Radiance. Has development and access to the latest source code moved to GitHub? Is the latest official release 4.2.2? Sorry I've been out of the loop for a while.

Hi Rick,

radiance-online.org is still the home of Radiance. It's there where you can find all the old links, and the source code repo on CVS (which Dan Fuller just linked to). That is home base. The GitHub thing is simply a mirror of the CVS repo, and from time to time I make Radiance installers and host them there. It's purely out of convenience for the OpenStudio project, so that users have access to recent versions of Radiance on all platforms.

P.S.

The GitHub mirror is synced with CVS HEAD hourly, and is merged to the "combined" branch:

https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/tree/combined

The releases posted on the NREL GitHub site reflect the release state of LBL's main site. So yes, 4.2.2 is the latest official release

https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/tag/4.2.2

When we make new pre-release (HEAD) packages on GitHub, we add an increment to the tail end of the package name, so "5.0.a.1" is the first package NREL made with the HEAD release after the source had been bumped to v5.0a. Sometime real soon now (I swear) we'll be able to build HEAD on Windows, and I'll make a 5.0.a.2 release tag, which will include a Windows installer.

Hi,

I'm pretty sure the scons build system hasn't been updated in a while. The Radiance source hasn't been build-able for Windows these last couple weeks anyhow. The good news is, the Windows issues were fixed as of this commit, yesterday:

https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/commit/e5017d45dddb919079d5ced7a914f463f8a86f2a

?and so you could use CMake/MSVC with this vintage of the source code to make your own Windows binaries:

https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/tree/e5017d45dddb919079d5ced7a914f463f8a86f2a

I'm gonna do a couple tests this morning and then make a new set of packages for all platforms, including Windows, so there's always that option. I'll post something here once they're all available.

Message-ID: <CABr=F_hzdi++Ca=jhDa8prfGPYg=PthTn+fiv9rqeA9Gk6t2BA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, may I ask if the unit of irradiance is *Wh/m2* if I use the "epw
weather file + gendaylit/gencumulativesky + rtrace" method to get the
irradiance of a given point for a particular hour in a year or annual total
irradiance?

The three radiation variables in epw file are using the unit of Wh/m2, so I
assume the output of rtrace simulation using epw file as input should have
the same unit. Is it correct?

Thanks!

Hi David,

The EPW weather file should contain total solar irradiance values in watts/sq.meter.  Radiance also reports values in watts/sq.meter, but only over the visible spectrum.  Therefore, we normally include an "efficacy" calculation that converts the EPW's radiometric values into these semi-photometric values.  (It's a bit confusing, but suffice it to say that Radiance's units have a relation to photometric units that employs a predefined efficacy/conversion value of 179 lumens/watt.)

If you want Radiance to actually give you total solar irradiance, then you should employ the -O1 option of gendaylit and gendaymtx.  This should forgo the usual correction factors.

Cheers,
-Greg

Message-ID: <624557036.4989626.1430126094586.JavaMail.yahoo@mail.yahoo.com>

Hi all,


I want tosimulate skies during a period very close to sunrise and sunset when the globalhorizontal skylight is between 100 and 1 lux). 

I tried touse Daysim and Meteonorm 6.0 to create a weather data file with 1 minuteintervals, but both of them are based on watt and their minimum value is 1 watt.When converting from irradiance to illuminance, it gives me around 140 lux asminimum. (I use ?gendaylit.exe 3 21 12.0 -a 59.7 -o -18.0 -m -15.0 -W 0.0 1.0-O 2? to create a sky with only 1 watt horizontal diffuse irradiance)


However Ineed to estimate the times that the skylight is less than 100 lux. 

I use Genskyto produce automatically the sky file for the times that the sun altitude isclose to horizon (below and above horizon), but it gives me much higher valuesthan I expected. I checked the IES handbook and it says that to estimatediffuse skylight (the Sky ratio method is not accurate for low solar altitude,and I guess that Gensky use the same method).

Therefore, Ireally appreciate if anyone can help me to produce a series of sky with 1minute intervals for the time the sun is very close to horizon (below or abovehorizon)


Best,

Majid

Dear?Wendelin,

?Thank you so much for your answer. I found the skartveit.c in the Daysim source files. I will take a look at it tonight.


Anyway, I want to ask one more thing; I create a WEA weather data file based on illuminance values instead of irradiance. Then I use ds_shortterm to create a WEA file with 1 minute intervals. As you see in the following, around sunset on 31st?of July, the illuminance values suddenly (in only minute) dropped from 107 to 0, however it should take much longer in real.

?

7 31 20.158 0 122

7 31 20.175 0 117

7 31 20.192 0 112

7 31 20.208 0 107

7 31 20.225 0 0

7 31 20.242 0 0

7 31 20.258 0 0

?

Is there any way to estimate the length of this period (from 100 lux to 1 lux)? It is probably different with different sky conditions, but if we think about clear sky, is there any studies that mention this period or not?


Best,Majid

The method you are looking for is the Skartveit-Olseth method. Unfortunately, I do not have any program code for it.
Have you already looked in the Daysim code? I think it is implemented there.

Dear Radiance Users,

I successfully built and tested the 64 bit executables of Radiance 4.3.a.2 (https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/tree/4.3.a.2), using Visual Studio 2013 64 bit and CMake 3.2.2. However, I'm running into a similar run-time crash when using rpict and oconv for very large geometries (2.4 GB geometry .rad file).

I ran 64 bit rpict in Debug mode inside Visual Studio 2013 to determine the cause of the ?Unhandled Memory Exception? error. The error was traced to line 198 in objset.c of Radiance 4.3.a.2 source code.

	Line 198: os = ostable[osentry];

 Variable, osentry (int), is used as an index to access an entry in the ostable[], object table array; osentry crashes with the value -26,513. I?m not sure what is causing osentry variable to attain a negative value.. I?ve printed the osentry to screen and noticed that it is evaluated to a positive integer many times before it attains the negative value. I printed the last few osentry values during run-time.

Osentry: 230041
Osentry: 145409
Osentry: 196801
Osentry: -243553

Oconv, breaks in the same line of code as rpict (line 198 in objset.c).

What can be causing a break at this point in the code?

Is there a limit to the maximum number of polygons/vertices that can be present in a scene depending on 32 or 64 bit Radiance executables?

Windows has limits to a function's recursion depth that is determined by the maximum stack size, which by default is set to 1 MB. Can the limit on the stack size be causing the unexpected run-time error?


Thank you,
Andrei Kolomenski

Oh it's definitely possible, and FYI we are doing it for Mac and Linux already. These are publicly available:

I also know folks are successfully building older vintages of Radiance
(4.3a) for 64-bit Windows. We just haven't had the time to get a Windows build system together to do it here; once we do, they will be posted to NREL's GitHub site alongside the others.

P.S.
Radiance 5.0a for Windows (32bit) is also a work in progress, which we hope to have available soon.

Hi Andrei,

I don't know of any hard and fast limits to the size of a Radiance model,
but it looks like you've found one.

Since you're compiling the source code yourself, here's a suggestion to try
in objset.c. This should keep you from trying to access a negative entry in
ostable. Change lines 182-183:

int  osentry, ntries;
long  hval;

to:

unsigned int  osentry, ntries;
unsigned long  hval;

For good measure, you might also change line 197:

osentry = (hval + (long)ntries*ntries) % OSTSIZ;

to:

osentry = (hval + (unsigned long)ntries*ntries) % OSTSIZ;

I'd suggest moving this thread over to the radiance-dev list. I'm
interested to hear how your large models go.

Nathaniel

Somehow cant use the command pfilt or change the pcomb, does this has to do
with the program Radiance? I have installed the version of windows from the
site, with evalglare v1.11windows . The problem is that I have composed a
.hdr (out of 7 jpg on a mac) and after using the command c:/HDRI>evalglare
-vth -vh 140 -vv 80 image.hdr all the dgp results are really low, less than
5%. The problem can be in the .hdr (calibrated as well) or is in the way
evalglare is not working as it shoot on my computer.

Hi Jasper,

why are you using -vth -vh 140 -vv 80 when in your header of the HDR 
image the view is specified as  -vtv -vh 98.797409 -vv 75.402067 ?
Manipulating the lense type is really dangerous - in that case you 
change from a perspective view to a hemispherical fish eye view, without 
changing the image!!

If I apply evalglare for your image I get 0.17 as DGP (which is still 
very low, but you have only 2000cd/m2 as maximum value, so this can be 
expected). Be aware, that DGP accounts only for glare from a high amount 
of daylight and/or spots of extreme luminances (>50000cd/m2), but not 
for contrasted glare between task (e.g. Monitor) and immediate 
surroundings for lower adaptation levels. This is subject of current 
research (also here at EPFL) and there might be an extension of the DGP 
in future, depending on the outcome of new experiments.

Back to the lens-type:
It is extremely important, that the right view type is given to 
evalglare, otherwise ALL calculated values (it doesn't matter if this is 
evalglare or findglare) are wrong. These errors could be huge, more than 
100% for calculating the illuminance out of a 180 degree image.

If you manipulate an image by pcomb, in general the view is marked as 
"invalid" in the header, because with that tool you could manipulate the 
image in a way, that the original view is not valid any more. This is 
why from evalglare version 1.0 on a check on the header was included, 
because many people were creating wrong headers without knowing it and 
then evalglare was calculating wrong values, when the header was invalid.

In addition for calculating the DGP it is important to have the 
illuminance at camera level. evalglare calculates this value out of the 
image. But if the image does not cover 180 degree, then the calculated 
value for the illuminance is too low. For that reason, the -i option was 
included, so you can provide the illuminance to evalglare (when you 
measure it with an illuminance sensor).

So in your case, you should measure the illuminance just besides the lens.
Then (in case this is the right lens description) you should use
evalglare -i LUXVALUE -vtv -vh 98.797409 -vv 75.402067 IMAGE_NAME
or better, if your task is always at the same place:
evalglare -i LUXVALUE -vtv -vh 98.797409 -vv 75.402067  -T 395 230 .6 -c 
CHECK_FILE_PICTURE IMAGE_NAME

good luck!

Jan
