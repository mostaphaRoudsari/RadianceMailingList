Subject: [Radiance-general] False color and luminance values
Message-ID: <001901d0283f$f44ad520$dce07f60$@yahoo.com>

Hello all,

 

A question regarding false color and luminance values. Starting with an
image created via rpict, and using the photosphere histogram, the max
luminance value is 351 nits. Selecting a small area around the top outer
corner of the shelf results in a mean around 302 nits. This agrees fairly
close to a measurement with a spot meter on the outer corner of a physical
version of the scene, so far so good.

 

Command: rpict -vtv -vp 0.75 .75 5.5 -vd 0.3 1.0 -0.6 -vu 0 0 1 -vh 45 -vv
45 -vo 3 -va 0 -vs 0 -vl 0 -av .1 .1 .1 -x 2000 -y 2000 -ab 2 -aa .1
shelf.oct > shelf_rpict.hdr

 

File: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/91366188/shelf_rpict.hdr

 

 

 

With a false color version, the histogram max luminance however is 177 nits,
the small area mean is 131 nits. Im not sure why the luminance values
between the two versions are different?

 

Command: falsecolor -ip shelf_rpict.hdr -e -s auto -n 16 -lh 1000 -lw 225
-log 4 -l > shelf_false_log_norm.hdr

 

File: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/91366188/shelf_false_log_norm.hdr

 

Thoughts?

 

Thank you!

Brian

Hi Brian,

How did you determine the "small area mean" of 131 nits using falsecolor?

The discrepancy between the two programs has to do with a bug in the "pextrem" program, which uses the intensity rather than the luminance to determine the brightest pixel.  In your case, the red shelves have higher intensity than the top shelf, despite the fact that the top of the bookcase has a higher luminance value.  Therefore, pextrem (used by falsecolor) thinks the brightest point is on a red shelf rather than on top, and both the luminance scale (using "auto") and the max value are incorrectly determined.

It is possible to correct this flaw in falsecolor without too much difficulty by replacing some lines of code, at a small expense in computation time.  This hasn't come up before, to my knowledge, as people tend not to use such strong primary colors.

Best,
-Greg

For the small area, in Photosphere I dragged and dropped a selection box,
which updated the histogram. I wanted to perform a sanity check to see if
values in my Radiance model where matching the real world model. Guess I'm
used to that type of selection in other programs and it appeared to work.
maybe need to check further.

Point well taken on the strong primary color, its federal paint standard
Insignia Red, aka Red Safety No 11105, aka Fire Suppression System red
paint. Its used on all the launch pad sprinkler system pipes. The grey is
Grey Standard No 16473, which is launch pad grey.

Thank you,

Brian

Hi Brian,

I guess I wasn't being clear.  I assumed you were selecting a box to average in Photosphere, which does indeed work as expected.  I was asking how you read the comparison value (131 vs. 302 nits) from your falsecolor output.

Cheers,

Gotcha. I selected a similar small area  in a linear version of the false
color output (131 nits) as was selected in the rpict version (302 nits).
Here is the lin ver.

I hope Im understanding your question correctly.

Hi Brian,

I don't think you can read the values in that corner accurately using "-s auto", which gets the wrong maximum due to the issue with pextrem and sets the scale too low.  If you use "-s 400" instead, you will see what I mean.

Cheers,

Hi Brian,

I don't think you can read the values in that corner accurately using "-s auto", which gets the wrong maximum due to the issue with pextrem and sets the scale too low.  If you use "-s 400" instead, you will see what I mean.

Cheers,
-Greg

Gotcha. I selected a similar small area  in a linear version of the false
color output (131 nits) as was selected in the rpict version (302 nits).
Here is the lin ver.

For the small area, in Photosphere I dragged and dropped a selection box,
which updated the histogram. I wanted to perform a sanity check to see if
values in my Radiance model where matching the real world model. Guess I'm
used to that type of selection in other programs and it appeared to work.

Hi Brian,

How did you determine the "small area mean" of 131 nits using falsecolor?

The discrepancy between the two programs has to do with a bug in the
"pextrem" program, which uses the intensity rather than the luminance to
determine the brightest pixel.  In your case, the red shelves have higher
intensity than the top shelf, despite the fact that the top of the bookcase
has a higher luminance value.  Therefore, pextrem (used by falsecolor)
thinks the brightest point is on a red shelf rather than on top, and both
the luminance scale (using "auto") and the max value are incorrectly
determined.

It is possible to correct this flaw in falsecolor without too much
difficulty by replacing some lines of code, at a small expense in
computation time.  This hasn't come up before, to my knowledge, as people
tend not to use such strong primary colors.

 

Best,

-Greg

Hello all,

 

A question regarding false color and luminance values. Starting with an
image created via rpict, and using the photosphere histogram, the max
luminance value is 351 nits. Selecting a small area around the top outer
corner of the shelf results in a mean around 302 nits. This agrees fairly
close to a measurement with a spot meter on the outer corner of a physical
version of the scene, so far so good.

 

Command: rpict -vtv -vp 0.75 .75 5.5 -vd 0.3 1.0 -0.6 -vu 0 0 1 -vh 45 -vv
45 -vo 3 -va 0 -vs 0 -vl 0 -av .1 .1 .1 -x 2000 -y 2000 -ab 2 -aa .1
shelf.oct > shelf_rpict.hdr

 

File: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/91366188/shelf_rpict.hdr

 

With a false color version, the histogram max luminance however is 177 nits,
the small area mean is 131 nits. Im not sure why the luminance values
between the two versions are different?

 

Command: falsecolor -ip shelf_rpict.hdr -e -s auto -n 16 -lh 1000 -lw 225
-log 4 -l > shelf_false_log_norm.hdr

 

File: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/91366188/shelf_false_log_norm.hdr

 

Thoughts?

 

Thank you!

Brian

Hi,

I missed that thread, so a late reply. While having the current CIE skies in gensky would certainly nice, we do not really depend on it. Philip Greenup had the models implemented in  a little cal-file (ssldlum.cal), which used to be on www.radiance-online.org in the patches-directory but disappeared with the installation of the new web-site.

Still, the file is documented on page 251 of Philip's thesis (a highly recommended reading, not only that one page..). For a quick pragmatic problem-solving copy&paste will do: http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15936/1/Philip_Greenup_Thesis.pdf

Cheers, Lars.

Hi Lars and all,

Thanks for the plug Lars!

For anyone interested in my cal file (from several years ago), let me know and I can send it through.

Hi,

I missed that thread, so a late reply. While having the current CIE skies in gensky would certainly nice, we do not really depend on it. Philip Greenup had the models implemented in  a little cal-file (ssldlum.cal), which used to be on www.radiance-online.org<http://www.radiance-online.org> in the patches-directory but disappeared with the installation of the new web-site.

Still, the file is documented on page 251 of Philip's thesis (a highly recommended reading, not only that one page..). For a quick pragmatic problem-solving copy&paste will do: http://eprints.qut.edu.au/15936/1/Philip_Greenup_Thesis.pdf

Cheers, Lars.


Zack Rogers developed a module for Python (IES_gensky.py) that is part of SPOT and updates the gensky model.

I also seem to remember that in one of the early Radiance workshops there was a reference to an updated CIE sky generator that could produce all 15 standard sky models. I don't think it ever got a public release but the source files were exchenged off-list now and then.

Regards,
Thomas

Hi Ehsan,

The gensky command has overcast and clear sky distributions based on an older CIE standard.  I don't remember which one, but gensky was written in the late 80's.  Subsequently in 1991 or so, I added an "intermediate" sky type, but I'm not sure it adheres to the newer 2002 standard.

Most people who care about the sky distribution using gendaylit, but if enough people really want it, I could see about updating gensky to the current CIE standard(s).

Dear All,

I have a lazy question, what is the latest version of CIE sky used in gensky at the moment? their latest update was in 2002 (CIE GENERAL SKY STANDARD DEFINING LUMINANCE DISTRIBUTIONS) if I am correct.

Cheers,
Ehsan

Hi Randolph,

some data is available. First, Peter has some translucent samples in his BME database:

http://www.pab.eu/gonio-photometer/demodata/bme/

There used to be an opal glass manufactured by Schott called Opalika. Unfortunately, when I tried to get some, I found that it was hardly available any more, so I would not plan an installation with it before getting a supplier. Still, it is interesting as there is quite detailed information even about the scatter characteristics available:

http://www.reichmann-feinoptik.de/assets/applets/opalika_phys.pdf

So this would be an example for an opal glass which is quite close to a perfect diffuser in the visible range. The peak overlaid on the plot is obviously measured in the NIR (the directional transmission increases beyond 800nm as mentioned in the text).

Of course you could also get a sample of the product of your choice and have it measured, now that there are all those goniophotometers around :)

Cheers, Lars.

I agree.  If it's not too much trouble to update gensky and we can do it properly, I'm all in favor of including this in the main distro.

That would be ideal, but even if the .cal file were just available in "lib"
for folks to use if they wanted, that would be sweet. My intent was not to
create more work. =)

The old radiance websites still exist, if you know how to get to them:
http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/
https://www.radiance-online.org:447/
Your browser will probably complain about the security of the second one,
and if you have an overzealous IT department you might not be able to use
port 447

Message-ID: <CBDA7B0F3FC5354F986B71977E204BEC40C3ED94@EX-MBX01.burohappold.com>

Happy New Year Radiance List,

Has anyone had success receiving manufacturer provide BSDF data for light redirecting films (3M/others)?
I see from Basurto?s 2012 workshop presentation there were some xml files from those studies, but does anyone know if these were modelled or measured BSDFs?

Best,

Chris

Dear Chris,

The files used by Basurto in her thesis (
http://dx.doi.org/10.5075/epfl-thesis-6425) were monitored using EPFL's
gonio-photometer. We had the manufacturers providing samples that we
measured.

Hope this helps,
Best,

Subject: [Radiance-general] how to 1) simulate reflected solar radiation and
 2) longwave radiation from heated surface
Message-ID: <CABr=F_jnVW_tO+zRPdXeA9dtcgh2LZKjNJYymONMcYf3BxzL0g@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list,

May I ask if Radiance can simulate the following:

1. the amount of solar radiation (both direct and diffuse) receivable for a
given point that is reflected from a given nearby surface, e.g the amount
of solar radiation at the centre of a 10x10 courtyard and 2m above ground
that is reflected from the building surfaces facing the courtyard.

2. the amount of longwave radiation received on a given point contributed
as a result of a nearby surface that are heated by the sun,

Thanks!

Hello Brian,
 
  Thank you for the fast response. I will give it a try.  
  How do I deinstall Radiance to set it a new? I see only the unpacked folder. Is it just by deleting the folder - i guess that would be too easy to be true//

I believe you can just delete the install directories to start from new. Or reinstall in a different location. Im pretty new to radiance, so you may want to wait for other feedback.

Hello Brian, 

 

Thank you for the fast response. I will give it a try.

 

How do I deinstall Radiance to set it a new? I see only the unpacked folder. Is it just by deleting the folder - i guess that would be too easy to be true//

While the benchmark is a nice way to test out various pieces of the Radiance codebase, it is in some ways abstracted from the bare metal installation of Radiance. Might be better to just try asking your system where it thinks your installed binaries are, e.g., "which rpict" should print the full path location of rpict on your system, like:

$which rpict
/usr/local/bin/rpict

If that command returns nothing, then your system doesn't know where Radiance is (which seems to be what the benchmark script is saying too). Double check that your paths are set properly, and that you are running the benchmark script from a NEW terminal window, not the one you used to compile Radiance and set the paths.

Hello Brian,

Thank you for the fast response. I will give it a try.

How do I deinstall Radiance to set it a new? I see only the unpacked folder. Is it just by deleting the folder - i guess that would be too easy to be true//

OK this one means you don't have the X11 libraries installed. This is something you need to have on your system in addition to XCode in order to build a few of the Radiance programs (rvu, image, etc.). Your build probably failed and you have a somewhat busted installation of Radiance, here.

(Bias alert) may I suggest you try the Mac Radiance installer we have available?
https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases

These have everything built already, and the installer puts everything in:
/usr/local/radiance/bin
/usr/local/radiance/lib
/usr/local/radiance/man

?and you can follow Andy's path setting tricks in that video you posted to get this all dialed in and working for ya.

!Indeed i get no files/directory found  
  eventough I see the radiance package unpacked under:  
  Applications/Radiance/HEAD  
  
  my paths are set to:  







  pico ~/.profile    







  export PATH=/Applications/Radiance/HEAD/ray/OUTPUT:$PATH    export RAYPATH=.:/Applications/Radiance/HEAD/ray/lib   









   export MANPATH=/Applications/Radiance/HEAD/ray/doc/man    
    as in the video tutorial by Andy McNeil/   I believe I am missing something that might be obvious enough, not for a new Mac user,though Robert, how would you proceed to solve such problem?

If you used the "makeall" script, you need to make sure that the path location(s) match what you selected in that step. However, your last error message about the X11 header file not being found, makes me think you don't have a complete set of binaries anyway. I'd recommend you install the binaries we have available at the NREL Radiance GitHub site, and then change the paths thusly, in your "~/.profile" file:

export PATH=/usr/local/radiance/bin:$PATH

export RAYPATH=.:/usr/local/radiance/lib

export MANPATH=/usr/local/radiance/man

This way we can eliminate any build/compile errors from the scenario and just focus on getting your system pointing to Radiance. How's that sound?

I believe I am missing something that might be obvious enough, not for a new Mac user,though

Robert, how would you proceed to solve such problem?

While the benchmark is a nice way to test out various pieces of the Radiance codebase, it is in some ways abstracted from the bare metal installation of Radiance. Might be better to just try asking your system where it thinks your installed binaries are, e.g., "which rpict" should print the full path location of rpict on your system, like:

$which rpict
/usr/local/bin/rpict

If that command returns nothing, then your system doesn't know where Radiance is (which seems to be what the benchmark script is saying too). Double check that your paths are set properly, and that you are running the benchmark script from a NEW terminal window, not the one you used to compile Radiance and set the paths.

Hello Brian,

Thank you for the fast response. I will give it a try.

How do I deinstall Radiance to set it a new? I see only the unpacked folder. Is it just by deleting the folder - i guess that would be too easy to be true//

Yeah, grab radiance 4.2.2-darwin.dmg and double-click that, then dbl-click on the installer package and follow the directions. Afterward, you still need to do the path setting step detailed by Andy in his video, just substituting the paths from my last email. If you use that installer, you don't need the source code (well, it's still useful for general interest, but you don't need it to run Radiance on your computer).

- Rob

P.S. You can also browse the source code on the GitHub mirror, and see the entire revision history, here:
https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/tree/combined  (make sure you're on the "combined" branch, which is the one we keep up to date with Greg's changes (hourly).) It's pretty awesome to see every change through time!

ok, so I would need now only to the radiance 4.2.2-darwin.dmg to unpack, no?
what do I need the source code for? -is it the non-compiled version of radiance 4.2.2-darwin.dmg?

OK this one means you don't have the X11 libraries installed. This is something you need to have on your system in addition to XCode in order to build a few of the Radiance programs (rvu, image, etc.). Your build probably failed and you have a somewhat busted installation of Radiance, here.

(Bias alert) may I suggest you try the Mac Radiance installer we have available?
https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases

These have everything built already, and the installer puts everything in:
/usr/local/radiance/bin
/usr/local/radiance/lib
/usr/local/radiance/man

?and you can follow Andy's path setting tricks in that video you posted to get this all dialed in and working for ya.

If you installed the 4.2.2 binary package form this link:
https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/download/4.2.2/radiance-4.2.2-Darwin.dmg

?then you just need to do the path thing I mentioned in my last email, and you should be able to run Radiance from a new terminal window. Uninstalling the last attempt is just a matter of deleting that directory. Looks like Andy has you install to /Applications/radiance/head or whatever. Just delete that directory, assuming everything is in there. When you change the paths, you'll be all set. Getting close!

export RAYPATH=.:/usr/local/radiance/lib

export MANPATH=/usr/local/radiance/man

This way we can eliminate any build/compile errors from the scenario and just focus on getting your system pointing to Radiance. How's that sound?

While the benchmark is a nice way to test out various pieces of the Radiance codebase, it is in some ways abstracted from the bare metal installation of Radiance. Might be better to just try asking your system where it thinks your installed binaries are, e.g., "which rpict" should print the full path location of rpict on your system, like:

$which rpict
/usr/local/bin/rpict

If that command returns nothing, then your system doesn't know where Radiance is (which seems to be what the benchmark script is saying too). Double check that your paths are set properly, and that you are running the benchmark script from a NEW terminal window, not the one you used to compile Radiance and set the paths.

Thank you for the fast response. I will give it a try.

How do I deinstall Radiance to set it a new? I see only the unpacked folder. Is it just by deleting the folder - i guess that would be too easy to be true//

Yeah, grab radiance 4.2.2-darwin.dmg and double-click that, then dbl-click on the installer package and follow the directions. Afterward, you still need to do the path setting step detailed by Andy in his video, just substituting the paths from my last email. If you use that installer, you don't need the source code (well, it's still useful for general interest, but you don't need it to run Radiance on your computer).



- Rob



P.S. You can also browse the source code on the GitHub mirror, and see the entire revision history, here:

 https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/tree/combined   (make sure you're on the "combined" branch, which is the one we keep up to date with Greg's changes (hourly).) It's pretty awesome to see every change through time!

OK this one means you don't have the X11 libraries installed. This is something you need to have on your system in addition to XCode in order to build a few of the Radiance programs (rvu, image, etc.). Your build probably failed and you have a somewhat busted installation of Radiance, here.



(Bias alert) may I suggest you try the Mac Radiance installer we have available?

 https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases 



These have everything built already, and the installer puts everything in:

/usr/local/radiance/bin

/usr/local/radiance/lib

/usr/local/radiance/man



?and you can follow Andy's path setting tricks in that video you posted to get this all dialed in and working for ya.

If you installed the 4.2.2 binary package form this link:

 https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/download/4.2.2/radiance-4.2.2-Darwin.dmg 



?then you just need to do the path thing I mentioned in my last email, and you should be able to run Radiance from a new terminal window. Uninstalling the last attempt is just a matter of deleting that directory. Looks like Andy has you install to /Applications/radiance/head or whatever. Just delete that directory, assuming everything is in there. When you change the paths, you'll be all set. Getting close!

If you used the "makeall" script, you need to make sure that the path location(s) match what you selected in that step. However, your last error message about the X11 header file not being found, makes me think you don't have a complete set of binaries anyway. I'd recommend you install the binaries we have available at the NREL Radiance GitHub site, and then change the paths thusly, in your "~/.profile" file:



export PATH=/usr/local/radiance/bin:$PATH



export RAYPATH=.:/usr/local/radiance/lib

The makeall step is not required if you are using the pre-compiled binaries. If you ran the installer and changed the patches, you are all set to? "begin". =)

First things first, you might now wanna try running the benchmark, or at least checking the basic installation is sound by typing "which rpict" at the command line. Should return "/usr/local/radiance/bin/rpict".

What you have now is Radiance installed on your Mac. Actually using it is the next exciting step, unfortunately it's  a little more complicated than just running an executable and poking around in some menus. I recommend checking out some tutorials on the main site, and browsing the radiance-online listserv archives (http://www.radiance-online.org/community/mailing-lists/archives/radiance-general).

Wheeeeee!

Yeah, grab radiance 4.2.2-darwin.dmg and double-click that, then dbl-click on the installer package and follow the directions. Afterward, you still need to do the path setting step detailed by Andy in his video, just substituting the paths from my last email. If you use that installer, you don't need the source code (well, it's still useful for general interest, but you don't need it to run Radiance on your computer).

- Rob

P.S. You can also browse the source code on the GitHub mirror, and see the entire revision history, here:
https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/tree/combined (make sure you're on the "combined" branch, which is the one we keep up to date with Greg's changes (hourly).) It's pretty awesome to see every change through time!

Dear all,

I wanted to install on Mac/Yosemite/ Radiance
rad4R2supp.tar.gz

Xcode is installed and updated for compatibility with OS Yosemite*

following the instruction :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptTmdKSfK68#t=137
I believe I have done something wrong installing it:

#after setting the Raypath , Path and Manpath as in the video
#I have unpacked benchmark
#typed :make (command)// "i have one processor"

and experienced the following error


------------------

CHANGES

2010-12-01 MJS reworked Makefile and options so that same code will

work on any version of Radiance going back ~5 years

2011-03-24 MJS removed "-pm 0.0" from optionsbase because rpiece throws

an error in 4R1

The makeall step is not required if you are using the pre-compiled binaries. If you ran the installer and changed the patches, you are all set to? "begin". =)



First things first, you might now wanna try running the benchmark, or at least checking the basic installation is sound by typing "which rpict" at the command line. Should return "/usr/local/radiance/bin/rpict".



What you have now is Radiance installed on your Mac.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Installing Radiance on OS Yosemite_make: *** [serial.unf] Error 127

Dear all,

I wanted to install on Mac/Yosemite/ Radiance
rad4R2supp.tar.gz

Xcode is installed and updated for compatibility with OS Yosemite*

following the instruction :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptTmdKSfK68#t=137
I believe I have done something wrong installing it:

#after setting the Raypath , Path and Manpath as in the video
#I have unpacked benchmark
#typed :make (command)// "i have one processor"

and experienced the following error


------------------

CHANGES

2010-12-01 MJS reworked Makefile and options so that same code will

work on any version of Radiance going back ~5 years

2011-03-24 MJS removed "-pm 0.0" from optionsbase because rpiece throws

an error in 4R1

Niyas-iMac:bench4 niya$ make

/bin/sh: rpict: command not found

/bin/sh: rpict: command not found

rm -f serial.unf

time rpict @viewpoint @options -x 2048 -y 2048 -t 60 -o serial.unf scene.oct

rpict: No such file or directory

0.00 real 0.00 user 0.00 sys

make: *** [serial.unf] Error 127

--------------



How do you solve such problem in order to proceed with installing Radiance on Mac?

Best Regards,

Niya

Daylight Simulation Enthusiasts,

I've uploaded sample HDR sky data for equinox and winter solstice from our
sky camera at FLEXLAB to compliment the summer solstice data previously
available: http://flexskycam.lbl.gov/

Has anyone tried to use these? I'd like to know what you did and how it
went.

Hi David,

While it may be possible to do something like this through careful scene design & trickery, Radiance is not geared towards long-wave IR calculations and under normal conditions, reflectors cannot also serve as emitting surfaces.  It is also tricky to separate components, such as distinguishing what came from building surfaces from the sky component.  Again, there are ways to accomplish it, but it's an advanced task and there would definitely be some debugging involved.

Cheers,
-Greg

Hello Jiajie,

Are you aware of the NREL precompiled WINDOWS Radiance
<https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases>? I have succesfully used them
at work along with Raspberry Perl. If that does not convince you, I guess
you can keep trying Cygwin... but I have no idea how to help you there.

Hi Jiajie,

I am agree with Germ?n. I also use Radiance in Windows OS (but 8) and the
only thing required (in addition to the Radiance execution file) is a Perl
interpreter (i.e. Strawberrya and Raspberry), which is needed in order to
run some commands, such as genklemsamp.

Take a look at this discussion:
http://www.radiance-online.org:82/pipermail/radiance-general/2014-July/010431.html


PS: There was also a tutorial about the Radiance Installation on window SO
(I guess by NREL) called "Getting Started with Radiance", but it seems to
be disappeared.

Cheers,
Giuseppe

Glad to hear the Radiance installers we have on the NREL GitHub mirror are working for some folks. The latest version is 4.2.2, and the Windows installer is located here:

https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/download/4.2.2/radiance-4.2.2-win32.exe

Apologies for the state of the Radiance-related tutorials on the NREL OpenStudio site, they are very outdated and overdue for an overhaul. We would like to get some things fixed and updated in the OpenStudio code, prior to revising the docs. Of course if you are merely looking for Radiance, the link above will get you where you need to go straight away.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Depth outdoor daylighting test facility
Message-ID: <CAOn=hKEa1zntuALKa+mfkP70X1UmMVWw_dvixS85=9XOCptJNQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear experts,



I am involved in the design of an *outdoor daylighting test facility*.


I am trying to evaluate the *minimum depth of the lab* in order to be able
to *study redirecting daylight systems* (i.e. light shelves or complex
lamella).

Cell height: 2.7 m and cell width: 5.5 m.


Our idea is to cover, let's say, "90%" of the applications of these systems.


Do you have experience in that field? Or can you suggest a modeling
approach to answer this question?



Thank you in advance.


Cheers,

Giuseppe.

Hi Giuseppe,

At LBNL we find that our window test bed (10 feet wide by 15 feet deep)
isn't deep enough to demonstrate all the full benefits of daylight
redirection. In this facility the redirected daylight often hits the back
wall.

Our new FLEXLAB (20 feet wide by 30 feet deep) we believe these dimensions
are deep enough, but we haven't yet tested daylight redirecting systems in
FLEXLAB (coming this spring!).

I like Christoph's suggestion of a standard reference office for testing
systems via simulation. And if physical test cells match the dimensions of
the simulation standard, all the better. A global network of identical test
cells at different institutions would be amazing.

For another datapoint, the Research Support Facility here at NREL is rather well daylit, and is 60' deep, but receives light from the north side as well as the south, in addition to heavy use of daylight redirection from the south. From experience (I've had a desk in the  middle of this building for the last few years), I'd say that the daylight redirection devices provide useful daylight as far back as 35' under ideal conditions, and on average to 25' from the south wall. These devices can also paint the back wall - 60' away from the source - with daylight! While impressive, I still say that *useful* daylight from those things (i.e. horizontal task illuminance >=250 lux) penetrates 35' or so at most; pretty much about as deep as LBNL's new test space (FLEXLAB).

I also like Christoph's idea for a standard office reference model for simulation; liked it the first time when it was called CIE 171:2006, too. ;) In all seriousness, I believe this Reinhart et al. model is a great idea -- especially product comparisons in simulation, across climates.

Thank you at all for the precious help. We will take in account all your
advices.

In the next weeks I will update you with the project evolution.

Happy weekend,
Giuseppe
For another datapoint, the Research Support Facility here at NREL is rather
well daylit, and is 60' deep, but receives light from the north side as
well as the south, in addition to heavy use of daylight redirection from
the south. From experience (I've had a desk in the  middle of this building
for the last few years), I'd say that the daylight redirection devices
provide useful daylight as far back as 35' under ideal conditions, and on
average to 25' from the south wall. These devices can also paint the back
wall - 60' away from the source - with daylight! While impressive, I still
say that *useful* daylight from those things (i.e. horizontal task
illuminance >=250 lux) penetrates 35' or so at most; pretty much about as
deep as LBNL's new test space (FLEXLAB).

I also like Christoph's idea for a standard office reference model for
simulation; liked it the first time when it was called CIE 171:2006, too.
;) In all seriousness, I believe this Reinhart et al. model is a great idea
-- especially product comparisons in simulation, across climates.

Hi Giuseppe,

At LBNL we find that our window test bed (10 feet wide by 15 feet deep)
isn't deep enough to demonstrate all the full benefits of daylight
redirection. In this facility the redirected daylight often hits the back
wall.

Our new FLEXLAB (20 feet wide by 30 feet deep) we believe these dimensions
are deep enough, but we haven't yet tested daylight redirecting systems in
FLEXLAB (coming this spring!).

I like Christoph's suggestion of a standard reference office for testing
systems via simulation. And if physical test cells match the dimensions of
the simulation standard, all the better. A global network of identical test
cells at different institutions would be amazing.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Depth outdoor daylighting test facility

Dear experts,

I am involved in the design of an outdoor daylighting test facility.

I am trying to evaluate the minimum depth of the lab in order to be able to
study redirecting daylight systems (i.e. light shelves or complex lamella).
Cell height: 2.7 m and cell width: 5.5 m.

Our idea is to cover, let's say, "90%" of the applications of these systems.

Do you have experience in that field? Or can you suggest a modeling
approach to answer this question?

Thank you in advance.

Cheers,
Giuseppe.

For more details about the FLEXLAB facility you can visit flexlab.lbl.gov
Andy recently completed the first client study in the facility that
involved daylight/energy/glare assessments with glazing, fixed shading,
operable shading etc  but not specifically "redirecting" devices- study to
be published later this year;  as he noted we expect to be doing new
testing of daylight redirecting systems over the next year.

Some additional examples of prior measuring and modeling of daylight
control and redirecting systems can be captured from
http://facades.lbl.gov/daylighting-systems

The IEA SHC Task 21 on Daylighting published a 260 page book- "Daylight in
Buildings, A Source Book on Daylighting Systems and Components"
You can download a 5MB PDF from our website:
http://buildings.lbl.gov/sites/all/files/daylight-in-buildings.pdf
This is about 15 years old but the sun is much older and both R&D and
practice move slowly so much of the info is still useful.  The Appendix in
the report describes 9 test facilities around the world ( as of ~2000) that
do/did daylight testing; with a semi technical description of their
measurement capabilities.  We have some extra (physical) copies of the
books on our shelves- if you still like hard bound books and daylight and
are not too far away to send ( they weigh about 5 pounds) I can mail a
copy. There is also a CD-ROM that contains the book and some additional
200MB of related files; I could post that on Dropbox if people are
interested.

Hi David,

my 2cents: The long wave part sounds basically achievable by ESP-r. You would probably need to model the courtyard as "indoor" with a very transparent roof, however. Long wave exchange can be tracked in ESP-r with quite high detailing. Possibly, you could also answer the solar question with ESP-r (separating "reflection" from "direct/diffuse solar" is probably also tricky, if actually necessary and likely a question of designing a few "experiments"). I am not entirely sure, though, how detailed reflections in closed spaces are followed (they are, to some degree). You can couple ESP-r with Radiance and if your material properties are "solar" and not "visual", I would expect that you could get a very good idea of what is happening in your space of interest.

A CFD package may be the alternative approach. However, I am not aware of any specific package in which solar reflection may be handled sufficiently. Long wave exchange should be covered O.K. One other possible source of a modelling package I am aware of could be Physibel (Belgium). They have tools that may cover your requirements.

Best
Achim

Hi Steve,

thank you for the literature materials, it is very interesting. And it
could be great if you share the CD-ROM contents. Ragarding the hard copy
shipping, it also could be great but Italy may be out of range. In the mean
time thanks again for the help.

Hi folks,

I'm experimenting with irradiance cashing turned off, and would appreciate
any tips. In a test scene, I have some curious results where surfaces meet
at a corner or edge. See partial image here (note the short partitions
meeting the floor plane, you also see it along the roof structure
components):
https://www.dropbox.com/s/9qcsxgk0h4xr4gf/test.tif?dl=0

Here are my rpict settings (most generated by rad program, overrides given
for ambient parameters):
-dp 4096 -ms 0.25 -ds .2 -dt .05 -dc .75 -dr 3 -ss 16 -st .01 -lr 12 -lw
1e-5 -ab 4 -aa 0 -av 0 0 0 -ar 800 -ad 3000 -as 1500 -ps 3 -pt .04

I'm guessing -ar doesn't matter, there may be some optimization tricks
between -ad and -as, and probably some really important variable I have
less of a grasp on...

Many thanks in advance!

Hi, Mike, many you can refer to the Axel Jacobs' Radiance tutorial in which
some combinations of Radiance's ambient parameters are proposed:

Mike,

I had this same problem in March 2013, and the non-intuitive solution
was to crank up "-ar". The higher that went, the smaller those halos
became.

Wow, -aa 0 -ab 4 AND -ad 3000? You must have a lot of time on your hands.

Mike,
Out of curiosity, at what image size (pixels) are you rendering, and are you using pfilt to filter down to the final image? I believe rendering many extra pixels with lower ?ad and filtering down by /5, /10, etc. is the typical approach for the sake of rendering time when setting ?aa 0. I?m not an expert in this, just recalling things I?ve seen in the distant past. I wonder if this approach would also reduce the size of those rendering artifacts.

Hi everyone,

 

I am new to Radiance and I run it in the VMware workstation virtual machine
with Ubuntu.

I have the book 'Rendering with Radiance' and at the end of the first
chapter there is a tutorial to show what Radiance can do briefly.

I am now following the instruction to input a simple room and input the
following code in Ubuntu terminal:

 

vi room.rad

void light bright

0

0

3 100 100 100

void plastic red_plastic

0

0

5 .7 .05 .05 .05 .05

bright sphere fixture

0

0

4 2 1 1.5 .125

red_plastic sphere ball

0

0

4 .7 1.125 .625 .125

%oconv room.rad>test.oct

%getinfo test.oct

%rview -vp 2.25 .375 1 -vd -.25 .125 -.125 -av .5 .5 .5 test.oct

%rview -defaults

 

In book it said that an image of a red ball can be seen on the screen, but
for me, nothing happened. I suppose it might be a graphic interfacing
problem but I don't how to solve it.

Besides, I found a little strange that every time when I tried to input 'vi
room.rad', I cannot directly input the next line which is 'void light
bright', I must input an 'o' first and then 'void light bright'. Can someone
explain this.

 

Many thanks,

Jiajie

Hello,

Are you getting any error messages?

I guess you can try

   1. changing rview by rvu (not sure if they are exactly the same...)
   2. the line  "vi room.rad" should not be in the room.rad file. It is the
   command for creating the file.

I do not use "vi"... you can try editing using "gedit room.rad", which is a
MUCH simpler text editor.

Tell us you error messages and maybe we will be able to help you!

Bye


German

Joe - indeed, Axel's resources are fantastic.

Mark, thanks for the tip - I'll see how it goes. So much for what I thought
I knew about -ar... It turns out you can get a pretty nice -aa 0 rendering
with today's newer machines in about the same time a "traditional" run
(complete with sampling artifacts) would take on 7-8 year old hardware...
It's a bit of an apples to oranges test, but interesting to see
advancements in hardware performance reducing the need for indirect
calculation optimization.

Chris, it's a 3000px rendering pfilted down to 1000px. I'll test out a
larger resolution too and see if the artifacts scale with the increased
iamge size.

Thanks!
MM

Hi German

 

Thank you for your help.

The problem is when I press enter button, nothing happened.

There is no error message.

 

Many thanks

Jiajie,

My guess is that the intended action associated with each line in the
example you are following is not clear.

*vi room.rad*

This opens a terminal based text editor. vi is notoriously difficult for
newcomers to use. I recommend nano for new users. To use nano type:

*nano room.rad*


The following lines should be entered into the text editor. With nano you
can use copy/paste to enter the commands.

*void light bright*

*0*

*0*

*3 100 100 100*

*void plastic red_plastic*

*0*

*0*

*5 .7 .05 .05 .05 .05*

*bright sphere fixture*

*0*

*0*

*4 2 1 1.5 .125*

*red_plastic sphere ball*

*0*

*0*

*4 .7 1.125 .625 .125*


After the text above is entered you should save the file and close the text
editor. With nano this is accomplished using ctrl-o to save than ctrl-x to
exit.


The following lines are commands that are entered at the terminal prompt,
not into the text editor. The % sign is intended to indicate the command
prompt, and should not be typed into the terminal.

*%oconv room.rad>test.oct*

*%getinfo test.oct*

*%**rview -vp 2.25 .375 1 -vd -.25 .125 -.125 -av .5 .5 .5 test.oct*

*%rview -defaults*


At the terminal type:

*oconv room.rad > test.oct*

This creates a Radiance octree scene  file from your scene file.


*getinfo test.oct*

This gives you information about the octree file. I get the following
output after running the command:

test.oct:

#?RADIANCE

oconv room.rad

FORMAT=Radiance_octree


rview is the old name for the interactive scene viewer. It was renamed to
rvu a few years back to avoid a naming conflict with a vi alias. So you
should type the following instead.

*rvu -vp 2.25 .375 1 -vd -.25 .125 -.125 -av .5 .5 .5 test.oct*

This opens an X11 window where you should see the red ball appear.


If you follow these instructions and don't get the expected output, write
back including any errors reported in the terminal.


Good Luck.

Andy

Chris's points about smaller -ad and larger image size oversampling
are spot on. I ran some tests about a decade ago and found that very
large images with relatively low -ad (and -as) generated better
renderings for a given compute time. Results with images are here:

http://markjstock.org/radmisc/aa0_ps1_test/final.html

This won't affect the artifact sizes (-ar will), but it's definitely
related to your task.

                      i was trying to estimate the irradiation on a Solyndra solar module, I created the model in GrassHopper (attachment:Solyndra.gh,); the Solyndra pipes are modeled as 24 side regular polygons extruded, their length is not perfectly aligned north-south, but is oriented some 8.5? clockwise (I'm trying to match some experimental data).

I run the simulation 4 times every hour of one day (therefore 96 times) using gendaylit with a sky description like the following one:

# Sky Definition



!gendaylit 12 16 11.5 -W 828 39 -a 46.467 -o -11.333 -m -15 -O 1 # 828 and 39 are values i copied from weather data, the weather station is close to the real Solyndra

The command for Radiance is written like the following (I have chosen as example the one which utilizes the sky shown above):
cd C:\Users\MLovati\Documents\Solyndra\quarterofhour
oconv -f C:\Users\MLovati\Documents\Solyndra\quarterofhour\blue_skyes_over_my_head\Solyndra_sky46.rad C:\Users\MLovati\Documents\Solyndra\quarterofhour\Solyndramaterial.rad C:\Users\MLovati\Documents\Solyndra\quarterofhour\Solyndra.rad > Solyndra.oct   #Solyndra_sky46.rad is the one shown above, (46/4 =11.5)
rtrace -I -h -dp 2048 -ms 0.063 -ds .2 -dt .05 -dc .75 -dr 3 -st .01 -lr 12 -lw .0005 -ab 2 -ad 1000 -as 20 -ar 300 -aa 0.1   Solyndra.oct < Solyndra.pts > _results\solyndra46.dat
    don't read: the folder name "blue_skyes_over_my_head" is in honour of a song from Tom Waits

in this way I can have a curve of the solar irradiation on the solyndra in one day (in this case the december 16th), and here it comes the puzzling part:
[cid:image003.png at 01D03B20.5C09C200]
Well, for those who think that the shape is strange: it's not, also the electricity production has that spike in the morning
The real question is: why it changes just a few from 10? to 9.25? (0.75?) and then abruptly from 9.25? to 8.5? (0.75?)
Does it makes sense? I didn't expect such a difference for 0.75?
for the sake of completeness: in the next chart this results are compared with the ones provided by a full deterministic model, please notice how there is not much difference, and they all are really similar to the 10? one, so the 8.5? clearly stands out of the group

Hope somebody can give me a clue, I am clueless
Thank You much everybody for your kind attention.

Marco,

Puzzling. I'd suggest starting by adjusting the simulation parameters to
make sure all ambient rays and direct rays are traced.

Here are the simulation parameters you used:
 -I -h -dp 2048 -ms 0.063 -ds .2 -dt .05 -dc .75 -dr 3 -st .01 -lr 12 -lw
.0005 -ab 2 -ad 1000 -as 20 -ar 300 -aa 0.1

Here are the parameters I recommend testing:
 -I -h -dt 0 -dc 1 -lw 1e-5 -ab 2 -ad 2000 -as 1000 -aa 0

If that doesn't help I'd like to see your Solyndra.pts file.

On a side note, this is the second posting where someone is using the -ms
parameter. Are people really using mist in daylight simulations these days?

Andy

Hi Wendelin,

There should probably be a clarification in the man page regarding uniform sampling, which currently ignores the surface orientation.  I don't know whether it would be better to document this in the man page or change the code so that back of uniform receivers do not accumulate energy.  Is this important in your application?

Cheers,
-Greg
