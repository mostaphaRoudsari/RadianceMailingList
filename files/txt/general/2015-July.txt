Subject: [Radiance-general] Rtrace result
Message-ID: <CABYweP0Sn2yaN8RY7N2EmBut4hN=4Ot9T-RRX3auaVAgWvjMgA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi master. I have question about the results of rtrace. I use radiance
5.0.b win 32 for windows.
I use numeric file  such 1.00 0.10 1.75 1 0 0

And i use command rtrace:
type numeric\30.fld | rtrace -I -ab 3 -h -w -oov octrees/ranc1_1140.oct |
rcalc -e "$1=179*(.265*$4+.670*$5+.065*$6)" > results\ranc1_1140_e.csv

The question is: the results of rtrace is different for several running. i
run that command for several times, but the result always different.
Anybody know what happens?

Without knowing your scene configuration (sky type, windows, size of space, etc.), this is normal based on random sampling of rays traced if your calculation parameters are not detailed enough for your scene. Try adding -ad 3000 into your command after -ab 3 and see if that improves your problem. You should also read the manual page, search old forum posts, and/or read the Rendering with Radiance book regarding rtrace parameters ab, ad, as, ar which would affect accuracy of ambient inter-reflection calculations, and can improve consistency by reducing random sampling errors.

Dear all,

 

it should be possible to automate a viewpoint as "view from the sun
position" in order to generate a sequence of images over a day, for example.
Sadly, I was unable to find anything on the net or in Rendering with
Radiance to this end. Does anyone know a good source - I would want to avoid
having to do the vector maths, myself ;o) ?

 

Thanks.

Message-ID: <20150703114408.Horde.Vfppc_0JoTKRKMl7Os3ii_w@correu.upc.edu>

Dear experts,

I am trying to learn three-Phase Method for Simulating Complex
Fenestration.

I have two questions of Sky Vector and Klems divisions of Daylight Matrix:

1) Sky Vector:
I am trying with Overcast Sky. I have done as following for Windows (I have
Ubuntu 14 now, but, I am checking the first steps done by Windows):

gensky 12 21 15 -c -B 0.55866 | perl c:/radiance/bin/genskyvec.pl -m 4 -c 1
1 1 > review/skies/12_21_15.skv

(I do not know if is good) So, I am sure that for each time during the year
it generates the same Sky Vector. However, I think that the "genskyvec"
calculation divided the sky in different parts in contrast with "gensky"
command that generate void brightfunc material. Therefore,?the skyvector
does launch different values for each sky division? If I rotated my model I
get different illuminance date for only Sky Vector variable?

2)?Klems divisions of Daylight Matrix:
When there is a definition of "kbin(Nx,Ny,Nz,Ux,Uy,Uz)", is it because for
each orientation there are some different values? I suppose that for each
orientation it uses the same divisions.

Excuse me, but, I am trying with a rotated model and I want to ensure that
I understand well the method. Sorry for the inconvenience.?Thank you in
advance.
Your faithfully,
Urtza.

Hi Achim

You may want to download a file named tracefromsun.tar from this URL:
https://drive.switch.ch/public.php?service=files&t=5b1df34fbb0f39db18a8d73494fdbdf4

It contains a C program that will do what you need.
Before compiling it, you have to adjust the latitude of your site at the beginning of the source file.

To use it you just need to call the tracefromsun program this way:

tracefromsun #month #day x y z

where
#month is the month number
#day the day within the month
x,y,z the coordinates of the "centre" point toward which all the rays will be traced

The program will send one ray per hour (true solar time is assumed) for te specified date. The output contains:
x y z coordinates of a remote starting point (i.e. the sun...)
dx dy dz the direction of the sunray toward the centre point

I hope this will help you.

Rapha?l

Gensky gives you the sun angle as a comment. You still have to convert it to a view vector and calculate the actual camera location yourself.

Hi Raphael,

being a lazy bum, I have to ask: Do you also have such a nifty tool to
calculate vh and vv from the Distance of the viewpoint (D) and the desired
size of the surface around (x,y,z)_center? 

Thanks again!

Urtza,

*Regarding question 1.*

The CIE Overcast sky is simetric and independent of the date and location.
That means that it does not matter if you rotate your model and the sky or
change the location and the date, it will always return the same vector
when fed into genskyvec.

Genskyvec approximate the sky as "finite elements" of constant Radiance. I
understand this is done using Ray-tracing. That means that each patch
(element of the sky vector) will have a different value that correspond to
this approximation.

Finally, the sky vector does not depend on the model just as the sun's
position does not depend on the orientation of your apartment. However, I
understand it is possible to calculate a rotated sky vector. This is faster
than performing all calculations again with a rotated model (i.e. if you
rotate the sky clockwise, it is the same as rotating the model counter
clock wise).




*Regarding question 2.*
Klems divition is always the same divition. However, the direction used to
trace rays (for sampling and calculating the View matrix) will depend on
the orientation of the window. This is the same as saying that the same
camera will give you different images if pointing on different directions.


I hope I understood your questions and that my answers help

Best,

Germ?n

  Hi Germ?n,
Thank you very much for explanation. Now I have more idea of the
Three-Phase Method.
I do not know how the sky rotate, but, I will check Sky Vector's
parameters.
Kind regards,
Urtza.

Dear all,

thank you all for your help! The little tool and additional information from
Rapha?l did the trick for me - no additional brain-work necessary which was
good due to the brain-cooking temperatures around here, the past days.

@Robert: If the script surfaces, as "hunter-and-gatherer" I would still be
interested, though.

Message-ID: <AE55A995167B224DBBFA16500E3AB9B3047F0A40@NDJSMBX202.ndc.nasa.gov>

Dear Radiance Community,

What makes a Radiance release "official"?

Looking at the Radiance Github site (https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases), I see that version 4.2.2 is the latest "official" release, whereas 5.0.a.1, 5.0.a.2 and 5.0.a.3 are pre-release versions.

What makes a Radiance release "official"? Is there a validation procedure carried out? If so, who is in charge of this and what are some of the test cases used for validation?

Thank you in advance,
Andrei Kolomenski

Message-ID: <D1C19E17.1AC61%Robert.Guglielmetti@nrel.gov>

Hi Andrei,

My $0.02, as an outsider:

The NREL GitHub site is simply a place where we (NREL) post our installers. Perhaps unfortunately, GitHub expects the "official" and "pre-release" tags on all the releases hosted there. I follow the convention laid out by Greg Ward as far as what is the official release and what is pre-release code, and we name our installers based on this convention (where ".a" is alpha code, ".b" is beta, and the absence of a letter denotes "official" releases. To be clear, the NREL Radiance GitHub site is simply a mirror of the main Radiance code repository which is managed with CVS, is hosted by LBNL, and this is the official release page:

http://www.radiance-online.org/download-install/installation-information

As far as testing, there is no standard test protocol for builds or releases. I started some tests that can be run in the CMake framework, here:

https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/tree/combined/cmake_tests

A (long) while ago, (I believe it was) Georg Mischler (who) started an Scons-based test framework, that got about as far as mine did:

https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/tree/combined/test

My tests are stupid and fallible. Georg's tests are very old and test a lot of seldom-used stuff (and none of the new stuff like rcontrib or photon map). They are both in the source for what they're worth; people could build on either of these.  I believe CMake's test framework (CTest) is awesome and could be used to build a very robust set of tests, and we would love to add these to the Radiance source and incorporate them into a dashboard, but this is unfortunately way down there, on a long TODO list.

Hi Andrei,

Rob is right that there is no big difference between an "official" release and any other update.  The main reason to have official releases is so individuals or institutions that distrust the development process can have a known quantity.

I typically create an official release every year or two when I feel: (a) there are enough new features to make a release sensible, and (b) the code is at a relatively stable point where nothing drastically new and untested has just been added.  Nevertheless, most official releases are followed in the subsequent weeks with patch releases to fix bugs that we or others have identified in the code.  It is really the patched official releases that end up being the most stable point, though it must be said at this time that the last official release is rather seriously behind in the features department.

Our goal is to make a new official release around the time of the upcoming Radiance workshop in August.

Cheers,
-Greg

Hello Rob & Greg,

Thank you for the responses and clarification.

As I understand, community testing/debugging is the main way of validating a Radiance release. It certainly would be nice to have a standard validation procedure (maybe using CMake/CTest) for each Radiance release.

Kind Regards,
Andrei Kolomenski

Hi Majid,

Normally, it's not a good idea to use the -ff option under Windows, even in a piped command, but I don't think that is the source of your problem in this case.  Did you double-check that your actual image size is 1024x591 by running vwrays with the -d option?

Since it stopped after 508 files when there should be 578, I suspect there is a limit under your version of Windows (or MINGW -- whatever environment you are using) to 512 simultaneously open files.  I bet if you use MF:1 it would work.

Best,
-Greg

Message-ID: <D697763F9F216044A99BC674C00561961358CA9710@EXCHANGE1.ad.nottingham.ac.uk>

Hi G. Larrain,

Thanks for your detailed clarification (below).

I wonder if you kindly can help me toward better understanding and answering the following:

We agreed that for daylight modelling of spaces with CFS, Radiance is a suitable tool as it applies ray-tracing method. And for annual and/or climate-based daylight calculations, as calculation time becomes a critical factor, using BSDF data for CFS is highly recommended to tackle the task with radiance (using phases methods). However:

- if someone needs to perform daylight calculations for given space with different CFS (different cases for comparison purposes) to get illumination levels for horizontal grid points (and not pictures nor scenes), is Radiance still the most convenient option?
- is it still needed to use any of the phase methods (2, 3 or 5)?
- most importantly, is it still needed to get BSDF data for CFS or just can model the detailed CFS in Radiance (and, if yes, how?)


Many thanks for your kind help :)

Regards
Ikrima


"Ikrima,

I am going to try to build the puzzle of CFS, Phases, BSDF and calculations.... at least the way I understand it.

*CFS* are those systems that, via interreflection or other light transport phenomena, redirect light (or solar radiation). Thus, in order to get a reliable result you will have to consider all the phenomena involved.
Then, *common
simple performance indexes*, such as the miss-used Shading Coefficient and the Aperture Percentage, *always loose a lot of information, trying to reduce all the complex behavior of a CFS to one single number*. We all know that venetian blinds are more "transparent" from certain viewing directions than from others, but these performance indexes do not tell you that.

Now... Radiance can certainly perform calculations of spaces with CFS using its "common" Ray-tracing. However, this may be slow for some purposes (i.e.
annual simulations and climate-based daylight modelling), and *this is why 2, 3 and 5 phase methods have been developed*. The *BSDF* representation, I would say, goes in the same direction... It allow summarizing all the bounces, reflections, refractions, etc.  that occure withing the CFS in a single matrix or tensor.* By using BSDFs*, Radiance itself and other tools (i.e. EnergyPlus) can treat CFS as blackboxes, avoiding all the opcits within the system. A BSDF that uses the Klems Full representation has
21,045 numbers (instead of one, such as the Shading Coefficient).

Being said all that, I would not trust a calculation method unless it can actually deal with the optics of a CFS that is drawn and/or it can use BSDF (or similar) information.

Lets remember that a perforated screen, a venetian blind, a light diffusing device can all have a Shading Coefficient of 50%, but all of them will behave very differently. I made some presentations about this on my previous work (we sold complex Shading Devices), trying to promote the use of BSDF in EnergyPlus calculations... the differences (in solar heat gains) were more than considerable.

I hope that someone else gives us his/her perspective on this topic...
there are a lot of concepts that I might be misunderstanding.

Best!"

BSDF data in an annual simulation context is generally limited to Klems
basis BSDF data, which may not be high enough resolution for some CFS. And
the 5-phase method, which can circumvent this, is not necessarily "quick".
This is all still very much a quandary and the newest daylight metrics
have added confusion to all of this, IMO.

Absolutely. The lack of an image-as-output requirement does not change the
fact that ray tracing is a good/convenient algorithm option for daylight
simulation problems, especially when dealing with diffusing media and CFS
in general. BSDFs allow you to do lots of "what-ifs", relatively quickly,
but are beholden to the limitations of the resolution of the BSDF.


>- is it still needed to use any of the phase methods (2, 3 or 5)?


Is what still needed? BSDF data? Ray tracing? I don't know of other
lighting simulation tools that can employ the multiphase methods. I would
say BSDF data is optional for 2-phase, required for 3-phase, and optional
for 5-phase. 

>- most importantly, is it still needed to get BSDF data for CFS or just
>can model the detailed CFS in Radiance (and, if yes, how?)


Again I'm confused as to what "it" is. A couple of approaches are
available to you in general. If you have a geometric model of the CFS you
can use Radiance (genBSDF) to make a BSDF of the CFS and use that in a 3-
or 5-phase context. However in an annual/climate-based simulation context,
you will be stuck with a Klems basis BSDF and that will not be very good
resolution for a lot of CFS; here you may want to use the 5-phase method
and stick the actual CFS geometry in the building model.

Some things to consider here are the photon map, now a part of Radiance
proper, or using the 2-phase method where appropriate. By 2-phase method I
mean generating a daylight matrix for your calculation points (or view),
and modeling the window material as-is. If the "CFS" is a shade cloth, you
can approximate that with a Radiance "trans". Same for translucent panels.
With this single daylight matrix, you can throw a vector of sky matrices
at it and get an annual climate-based result very quickly. Problem is, we
want to do stuff to the windows, sometimes at the time step level, so:

Blinds and compact daylight redirection devices (e.g. Lightlouver) are
best represented as BSDF, and if most of the redirected flux is headed up
and away from the points of interest, a Klems basis BSDF is good enough
IMO. In these cases you could use the 3-phase method. Problem is when you
have a BSDF for blinds, and you also want to simulate the blinds-up
condition (i.e. clear, specularly transmitting glass). Using a Klems basis
BSDF for this is sub-optimal. You end up needing to do two annual
simulations, one as 2-phase for the clear glass scenario, and again as a
3-phase (with a blinds BSDF for the transmission matrix) for the blinds
down condition. If you have a lot of different window groups, your
simulation space can get large in a hurry. But it's still do-able and you
can get results that tell a story you simply couldn't tell 5 years ago,
informing the newest daylight metrics as well.

I must say that I agree with Rob, however, a short answer that might help.

For evaluating illuminance levels in a space with different CFS you,
strictly speaking, DO NOT HAVE TO do anything. You may choose between
different methods that have some pros and cons.


*ray-tracing*

   - Requires ray-tracing for each time-step and each system, which is slow
   (*four systems simulated annualy in an hourly basis --> 4*8760 = 35,040
   simulations*.)
   - As accurate as it gets, if options are defined correctly.


*2 phase method*

   - Do not need the BSDF
   - Requires ray-tracing for each CFS (*4 systems --> 4 ray-tracing
   simulations*)
   - After ray-tracing, annual simulation is fast.

*3-phase method:*

   - Requires BSDF data in KLEMS basis, which may be slow to compute,
   unless it can be exported from WINDOW, for example, or such data has
   already been calculated (the idea is to make a database, I think).
   - Does not really work well for specular systems (Klems patches are too
   big)
   - Requires 2 ray-tracing runs, always (*4 systems --> 2 ray-tracing
   simulations*)
   - After ray-tracing and BSDF calculation, annual simulation is fast

*5-phase method:*

   - Requires BSDF data in KLEMS  basis AND/OR Tensor tree format, which
   may be slow to compute, unless it can be exported from WINDOW, for example,
   or such data has already been calculated (the idea is to make a database, I
   think).
   - Works well for specular systems
   - Requires 4 ray-tracing runs + 1 for each system, always (*4 systems
   --> 4+1 = 5 ray-tracing simulations*)
   - Hard to code...?
   - After ray-tracing and BSDF calculation, annual simulation is fast


I would not say there is a recipe. If you have to choose between 1 or 2
CFSs, maybe it is faster to just draw them and use the 2 phase method (or
ray-tracing if an annual simulaton is not required). On the contrary, if
you are going to test 10 different CFSs, 3 and 5 phases may make sense,
since you reduce the expensive ray-tracing calculations... However, this
will also depend on weather you have the BSDF data AND/OR if it makes sense
to calculate it and store it AND/OR if you intend to simulate a dynamically
controlled CFS.

Best!

Hi Robert,

My PC is running on Windows 7 Enterprise.
Initially, I installed Radiance for Window using its installer but I found that most of the tutorials are provided for pc with Linux and/or Linux-like operating systems; So I had to install try learnix (that did not work) and Ubuntu (also did not work)!
Finally, I tried to use Cygwin to run Radiance on Window OS. I could install Cygwin (works fine), Xming (not sure if working) and Radiance (not all its programs are working!).

I'm a bit confused as I'm not sure if running Radiance on windows using Cygwin will be enough for carrying my work. For example, can I work out phases methods and generate BSDF data?

I wish if you can help me to do that.

Many thanks
ikrima

Hi Ikrima,

We'll need a bit more info, here. What OS are you on? How are you attempting to install it (using an installer, compiling from source, or what)? What happens when you try??

OK so it sounds like you first tried the Windows installer (presumably a
NREL-provided one such as this:
https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/download/5.0.a.3/radiance-5.0.a-w
in64.exe), and this most likely worked fine, you just had some issues
actually *doing* anything with it. This is normal. =)

I recommend you install Git for windows (https://msysgit.github.io/), as
that will add a little BASH emulator in your Windows system. This way you
can run most of the commands exactly as they appear in most of the
tutorials out there that are written from a UNIX perspective (as you point
out). If you run the "Git BASH shell" you will be able to try out all the
multi-phase methods, use and generate BSDFs, etc. Once you have Git for
Windows installed, head over to Andy McNeil's tutorials for 3- and
5-phase, fire up the Git BASH shell (it'll be in the Git program group in
the Windows start menu), and get started!

One thing to keep in mind is that when running any commands that
read/write data (e.g. rcontrib), be sure to use ASCII format rather than
float. Windows has issues with float data (among many other things).

Good luck!

Message-ID: <D697763F9F216044A99BC674C00561961358CA9BAF@EXCHANGE1.ad.nottingham.ac.uk>

Hi all,

Thanks Robert and Larrain for your detailed replies, that helped me a lot.

I would summarise here what I got form your appreciated replies, as following:
- Radiance is convenient and best of tools to model daylighting due to its ray-tracing method.
- 3 or 5-phases methods are used to facilitate the calculations.
- Generating BSDF data is also used to facilitate these calculations but it is limited to Klems resolution of some CFS.

Initially, I'm not planning to do annual calculations. It's just for specific hours of the day and the target is to produce a illuminance levels for indoor grid under different CFSs. Hence, according to my understanding from Larrain words, I can use either 2-phase or Ray-tracing methods. My question is how can I draw/define the CFS geometry and Space for these calculations? Is it similar to the way use in Ecotect/Radiance calculations?

Regards
Ikrima

Hi G. Larrain,

Thanks for your detailed clarification (below).

I wonder if you kindly can help me toward better understanding and answering the following:

We agreed that for daylight modelling of spaces with CFS, Radiance is a suitable tool as it applies ray-tracing method. And for annual and/or climate-based daylight calculations, as calculation time becomes a critical factor, using BSDF data for CFS is highly recommended to tackle the task with radiance (using phases methods). However:

- if someone needs to perform daylight calculations for given space with different CFS (different cases for comparison purposes) to get illumination levels for horizontal grid points (and not pictures nor scenes), is Radiance still the most convenient option?
- is it still needed to use any of the phase methods (2, 3 or 5)?
- most importantly, is it still needed to get BSDF data for CFS or just can model the detailed CFS in Radiance (and, if yes, how?)


Many thanks for your kind help :)

Regards
Ikrima


"Ikrima,

I am going to try to build the puzzle of CFS, Phases, BSDF and calculations.... at least the way I understand it.

*CFS* are those systems that, via interreflection or other light transport phenomena, redirect light (or solar radiation). Thus, in order to get a reliable result you will have to consider all the phenomena involved.
Then, *common
simple performance indexes*, such as the miss-used Shading Coefficient and the Aperture Percentage, *always loose a lot of information, trying to reduce all the complex behavior of a CFS to one single number*. We all know that venetian blinds are more "transparent" from certain viewing directions than from others, but these performance indexes do not tell you that.

Now... Radiance can certainly perform calculations of spaces with CFS using its "common" Ray-tracing. However, this may be slow for some purposes (i.e.
annual simulations and climate-based daylight modelling), and *this is why 2, 3 and 5 phase methods have been developed*. The *BSDF* representation, I would say, goes in the same direction... It allow summarizing all the bounces, reflections, refractions, etc.  that occure withing the CFS in a single matrix or tensor.* By using BSDFs*, Radiance itself and other tools (i.e. EnergyPlus) can treat CFS as blackboxes, avoiding all the opcits within the system. A BSDF that uses the Klems Full representation has
21,045 numbers (instead of one, such as the Shading Coefficient).

Being said all that, I would not trust a calculation method unless it can actually deal with the optics of a CFS that is drawn and/or it can use BSDF (or similar) information.

Lets remember that a perforated screen, a venetian blind, a light diffusing device can all have a Shading Coefficient of 50%, but all of them will behave very differently. I made some presentations about this on my previous work (we sold complex Shading Devices), trying to promote the use of BSDF in EnergyPlus calculations... the differences (in solar heat gains) were more than considerable.

I hope that someone else gives us his/her perspective on this topic...
there are a lot of concepts that I might be misunderstanding.

Best!"

BSDF data in an annual simulation context is generally limited to Klems basis BSDF data, which may not be high enough resolution for some CFS. And the 5-phase method, which can circumvent this, is not necessarily "quick".
This is all still very much a quandary and the newest daylight metrics have added confusion to all of this, IMO.

Absolutely. The lack of an image-as-output requirement does not change the fact that ray tracing is a good/convenient algorithm option for daylight simulation problems, especially when dealing with diffusing media and CFS in general. BSDFs allow you to do lots of "what-ifs", relatively quickly, but are beholden to the limitations of the resolution of the BSDF.


>- is it still needed to use any of the phase methods (2, 3 or 5)?


Is what still needed? BSDF data? Ray tracing? I don't know of other lighting simulation tools that can employ the multiphase methods. I would say BSDF data is optional for 2-phase, required for 3-phase, and optional for 5-phase.

>- most importantly, is it still needed to get BSDF data for CFS or just
>can model the detailed CFS in Radiance (and, if yes, how?)


Again I'm confused as to what "it" is. A couple of approaches are available to you in general. If you have a geometric model of the CFS you can use Radiance (genBSDF) to make a BSDF of the CFS and use that in a 3- or 5-phase context. However in an annual/climate-based simulation context, you will be stuck with a Klems basis BSDF and that will not be very good resolution for a lot of CFS; here you may want to use the 5-phase method and stick the actual CFS geometry in the building model.

Some things to consider here are the photon map, now a part of Radiance proper, or using the 2-phase method where appropriate. By 2-phase method I mean generating a daylight matrix for your calculation points (or view), and modeling the window material as-is. If the "CFS" is a shade cloth, you can approximate that with a Radiance "trans". Same for translucent panels.
With this single daylight matrix, you can throw a vector of sky matrices at it and get an annual climate-based result very quickly. Problem is, we want to do stuff to the windows, sometimes at the time step level, so:

Blinds and compact daylight redirection devices (e.g. Lightlouver) are best represented as BSDF, and if most of the redirected flux is headed up and away from the points of interest, a Klems basis BSDF is good enough IMO. In these cases you could use the 3-phase method. Problem is when you have a BSDF for blinds, and you also want to simulate the blinds-up condition (i.e. clear, specularly transmitting glass). Using a Klems basis BSDF for this is sub-optimal. You end up needing to do two annual simulations, one as 2-phase for the clear glass scenario, and again as a 3-phase (with a blinds BSDF for the transmission matrix) for the blinds down condition. If you have a lot of different window groups, your simulation space can get large in a hurry. But it's still do-able and you can get results that tell a story you simply couldn't tell 5 years ago, informing the newest daylight metrics as well.

I must say that I agree with Rob, however, a short answer that might help.

For evaluating illuminance levels in a space with different CFS you, strictly speaking, DO NOT HAVE TO do anything. You may choose between different methods that have some pros and cons.


*ray-tracing*

   - Requires ray-tracing for each time-step and each system, which is slow
   (*four systems simulated annualy in an hourly basis --> 4*8760 = 35,040
   simulations*.)
   - As accurate as it gets, if options are defined correctly.


*2 phase method*

   - Do not need the BSDF
   - Requires ray-tracing for each CFS (*4 systems --> 4 ray-tracing
   simulations*)
   - After ray-tracing, annual simulation is fast.

*3-phase method:*

   - Requires BSDF data in KLEMS basis, which may be slow to compute,
   unless it can be exported from WINDOW, for example, or such data has
   already been calculated (the idea is to make a database, I think).
   - Does not really work well for specular systems (Klems patches are too
   big)
   - Requires 2 ray-tracing runs, always (*4 systems --> 2 ray-tracing
   simulations*)
   - After ray-tracing and BSDF calculation, annual simulation is fast

*5-phase method:*

   - Requires BSDF data in KLEMS  basis AND/OR Tensor tree format, which
   may be slow to compute, unless it can be exported from WINDOW, for example,
   or such data has already been calculated (the idea is to make a database, I
   think).
   - Works well for specular systems
   - Requires 4 ray-tracing runs + 1 for each system, always (*4 systems
   --> 4+1 = 5 ray-tracing simulations*)
   - Hard to code...?
   - After ray-tracing and BSDF calculation, annual simulation is fast


I would not say there is a recipe. If you have to choose between 1 or 2 CFSs, maybe it is faster to just draw them and use the 2 phase method (or ray-tracing if an annual simulaton is not required). On the contrary, if you are going to test 10 different CFSs, 3 and 5 phases may make sense, since you reduce the expensive ray-tracing calculations... However, this will also depend on weather you have the BSDF data AND/OR if it makes sense to calculate it and store it AND/OR if you intend to simulate a dynamically controlled CFS.

Best!

Subject: [Radiance-general] genBSDF with blinds only?
Message-ID: <D1C5510A.1AEFA%Robert.Guglielmetti@nrel.gov>

Let's say I want to make a BSDF for a venetian blind, that I could attach to a polygon that is *not* a window, but rather a proxy surface (because I do).

genBSDF still needs a uniform polygon to sample from, right? But I want this polygon to be completely invisible to the simulation, it's just representing an area from which to sample. Could I use antimatter in this case? In other words my input geometry would just be the blind slats (all in the -z), with a single polygon to represent the interface, which would serve as the area for the sampling origins as well. It is this polygon that would be made of antimatter. The point is to make a BSDF that just represents the scatter of light passing through the blinds. It seems that in all the examples I see out there, the input geometry describes an entire window system, with glazing and frames and everything. My goal is to make a general BSDF for the blinds only, which could be inserted into any model (either as a BSDF material, or as a T matrix), applying it to a proxy polygon just inboard of the window/IGU.

Help.

Rob.

If it is just for a few "moments" of the day, I would just use ray-tracing.

Regarding "how do I draw...", I have to say that there are several options.
I am not sure how flexible is Ecotect to draw CFS... but there are two
exporters from SketchUp: SU2RAD and Groundhog. As the developer of the
latter, I would recommend you to ask someone else about it, because I think
it is awesome, haha.

Subject: [Radiance-general] genBSDF with blinds only?

Hi Rob,

The trick is to use the "-dim" option of genBSDF to sample an interior region of the blinds, thus avoiding the edge condition and creating a BSDF that you can apply generically.  Andy McNeil has an example of this in the genBSDF tutorial he is writing.  I will send you a draft of it off-list, as he's not quite done editing it.

In general, genBSDF always creates a virtual surface for sampling, and when you apply it to a surface for rendering, it behaves as a proxy for the actual geometry.  You can of course include real geometry if you like by giving the BSDF primitive a thickness, and this is described in my presentation from a few workshops back:

	http://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2011-berkeley-ca/presentations/day1/GW2_New_BSDF.pdf

Cheers,
-Greg

Could I use antimatter in this case? In other words my input geometry would just be the blind slats (all in the -z), with a single polygon to represent the interface, which would serve as the area for the sampling origins as well. It is this polygon that would be made of antimatter. The point is to make a BSDF that just represents the scatter of light passing through the blinds. It seems that in all the examples I see out there, the input geometry describes an entire window system, with glazing and frames and everything. My goal is to make a general BSDF for the blinds only, which could be inserted into any model (either as a BSDF material, or as a T matrix), applying it to a proxy polygon just inboard of the window/IGU.

Hi Robert,

Many thanks for your help.

I have installed Git for Windows as you adviced :) Now, Before I start with 3 or 5-phase tutorials, I'm thinking to go through "radiance tutorial" (by Axel Jacobs) as a beginner with almost a shallow knowledge/experience of radiance. So, do recommend this (radiance tutorial would be enough to start with 3 or 5-phase methods and understanding of BSDF data approach, etc) or advice another tutorial/source for better understanding of radiance basics (using command prompt)?

Many thanks again :)

Regards
Ikrima

OK so it sounds like you first tried the Windows installer (presumably a NREL-provided one such as this:
https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/download/5.0.a.3/radiance-5.0.a-w
in64.exe), and this most likely worked fine, you just had some issues actually *doing* anything with it. This is normal. =)

I recommend you install Git for windows (https://msysgit.github.io/), as that will add a little BASH emulator in your Windows system. This way you can run most of the commands exactly as they appear in most of the tutorials out there that are written from a UNIX perspective (as you point out). If you run the "Git BASH shell" you will be able to try out all the multi-phase methods, use and generate BSDFs, etc. Once you have Git for Windows installed, head over to Andy McNeil's tutorials for 3- and 5-phase, fire up the Git BASH shell (it'll be in the Git program group in the Windows start menu), and get started!

One thing to keep in mind is that when running any commands that read/write data (e.g. rcontrib), be sure to use ASCII format rather than float. Windows has issues with float data (among many other things).

Good luck!

Hi all,

Thanks Robert and Larrain for your detailed replies, that helped me a lot.

I would summarise here what I got form your appreciated replies, as following:
- Radiance is convenient and best of tools to model daylighting due to its ray-tracing method.
- 3 or 5-phases methods are used to facilitate the calculations.
- Generating BSDF data is also used to facilitate these calculations but it is limited to Klems resolution of some CFS.

Initially, I'm not planning to do annual calculations. It's just for specific hours of the day and the target is to produce a illuminance levels for indoor grid under different CFSs. Hence, according to my understanding from Larrain words, I can use either 2-phase or Ray-tracing methods. My question is how can I draw/define the CFS geometry and Space for these calculations? Is it similar to the way use in Ecotect/Radiance calculations?

Regards
Ikrima

Hi G. Larrain,

Thanks for your detailed clarification (below).

I wonder if you kindly can help me toward better understanding and answering the following:

We agreed that for daylight modelling of spaces with CFS, Radiance is a suitable tool as it applies ray-tracing method. And for annual and/or climate-based daylight calculations, as calculation time becomes a critical factor, using BSDF data for CFS is highly recommended to tackle the task with radiance (using phases methods). However:

- if someone needs to perform daylight calculations for given space with different CFS (different cases for comparison purposes) to get illumination levels for horizontal grid points (and not pictures nor scenes), is Radiance still the most convenient option?
- is it still needed to use any of the phase methods (2, 3 or 5)?
- most importantly, is it still needed to get BSDF data for CFS or just can model the detailed CFS in Radiance (and, if yes, how?)


Many thanks for your kind help :)

Regards
Ikrima


"Ikrima,

I am going to try to build the puzzle of CFS, Phases, BSDF and calculations.... at least the way I understand it.

*CFS* are those systems that, via interreflection or other light transport phenomena, redirect light (or solar radiation). Thus, in order to get a reliable result you will have to consider all the phenomena involved.
Then, *common
simple performance indexes*, such as the miss-used Shading Coefficient and the Aperture Percentage, *always loose a lot of information, trying to reduce all the complex behavior of a CFS to one single number*. We all know that venetian blinds are more "transparent" from certain viewing directions than from others, but these performance indexes do not tell you that.

Now... Radiance can certainly perform calculations of spaces with CFS using its "common" Ray-tracing. However, this may be slow for some purposes (i.e.
annual simulations and climate-based daylight modelling), and *this is why 2, 3 and 5 phase methods have been developed*. The *BSDF* representation, I would say, goes in the same direction... It allow summarizing all the bounces, reflections, refractions, etc.  that occure withing the CFS in a single matrix or tensor.* By using BSDFs*, Radiance itself and other tools (i.e. EnergyPlus) can treat CFS as blackboxes, avoiding all the opcits within the system. A BSDF that uses the Klems Full representation has
21,045 numbers (instead of one, such as the Shading Coefficient).

Being said all that, I would not trust a calculation method unless it can actually deal with the optics of a CFS that is drawn and/or it can use BSDF (or similar) information.

Lets remember that a perforated screen, a venetian blind, a light diffusing device can all have a Shading Coefficient of 50%, but all of them will behave very differently. I made some presentations about this on my previous work (we sold complex Shading Devices), trying to promote the use of BSDF in EnergyPlus calculations... the differences (in solar heat gains) were more than considerable.

I hope that someone else gives us his/her perspective on this topic...
there are a lot of concepts that I might be misunderstanding.

Best!"

Some very quick replies and clarifications within:

BSDF data in an annual simulation context is generally limited to Klems basis BSDF data, which may not be high enough resolution for some CFS. And the 5-phase method, which can circumvent this, is not necessarily "quick".
This is all still very much a quandary and the newest daylight metrics have added confusion to all of this, IMO.

Absolutely. The lack of an image-as-output requirement does not change the fact that ray tracing is a good/convenient algorithm option for daylight simulation problems, especially when dealing with diffusing media and CFS in general. BSDFs allow you to do lots of "what-ifs", relatively quickly, but are beholden to the limitations of the resolution of the BSDF.


>- is it still needed to use any of the phase methods (2, 3 or 5)?


Is what still needed? BSDF data? Ray tracing? I don't know of other lighting simulation tools that can employ the multiphase methods. I would say BSDF data is optional for 2-phase, required for 3-phase, and optional for 5-phase.

>- most importantly, is it still needed to get BSDF data for CFS or just
>can model the detailed CFS in Radiance (and, if yes, how?)


Again I'm confused as to what "it" is. A couple of approaches are available to you in general. If you have a geometric model of the CFS you can use Radiance (genBSDF) to make a BSDF of the CFS and use that in a 3- or 5-phase context. However in an annual/climate-based simulation context, you will be stuck with a Klems basis BSDF and that will not be very good resolution for a lot of CFS; here you may want to use the 5-phase method and stick the actual CFS geometry in the building model.

Some things to consider here are the photon map, now a part of Radiance proper, or using the 2-phase method where appropriate. By 2-phase method I mean generating a daylight matrix for your calculation points (or view), and modeling the window material as-is. If the "CFS" is a shade cloth, you can approximate that with a Radiance "trans". Same for translucent panels.
With this single daylight matrix, you can throw a vector of sky matrices at it and get an annual climate-based result very quickly. Problem is, we want to do stuff to the windows, sometimes at the time step level, so:

Blinds and compact daylight redirection devices (e.g. Lightlouver) are best represented as BSDF, and if most of the redirected flux is headed up and away from the points of interest, a Klems basis BSDF is good enough IMO. In these cases you could use the 3-phase method. Problem is when you have a BSDF for blinds, and you also want to simulate the blinds-up condition (i.e. clear, specularly transmitting glass). Using a Klems basis BSDF for this is sub-optimal. You end up needing to do two annual simulations, one as 2-phase for the clear glass scenario, and again as a 3-phase (with a blinds BSDF for the transmission matrix) for the blinds down condition. If you have a lot of different window groups, your simulation space can get large in a hurry. But it's still do-able and you can get results that tell a story you simply couldn't tell 5 years ago, informing the newest daylight metrics as well.

I must say that I agree with Rob, however, a short answer that might help.

For evaluating illuminance levels in a space with different CFS you, strictly speaking, DO NOT HAVE TO do anything. You may choose between different methods that have some pros and cons.


*ray-tracing*

   - Requires ray-tracing for each time-step and each system, which is slow
   (*four systems simulated annualy in an hourly basis --> 4*8760 = 35,040
   simulations*.)
   - As accurate as it gets, if options are defined correctly.


*2 phase method*

   - Do not need the BSDF
   - Requires ray-tracing for each CFS (*4 systems --> 4 ray-tracing
   simulations*)
   - After ray-tracing, annual simulation is fast.

*3-phase method:*

   - Requires BSDF data in KLEMS basis, which may be slow to compute,
   unless it can be exported from WINDOW, for example, or such data has
   already been calculated (the idea is to make a database, I think).
   - Does not really work well for specular systems (Klems patches are too
   big)
   - Requires 2 ray-tracing runs, always (*4 systems --> 2 ray-tracing
   simulations*)
   - After ray-tracing and BSDF calculation, annual simulation is fast

*5-phase method:*

   - Requires BSDF data in KLEMS  basis AND/OR Tensor tree format, which
   may be slow to compute, unless it can be exported from WINDOW, for example,
   or such data has already been calculated (the idea is to make a database, I
   think).
   - Works well for specular systems
   - Requires 4 ray-tracing runs + 1 for each system, always (*4 systems
   --> 4+1 = 5 ray-tracing simulations*)
   - Hard to code...?
   - After ray-tracing and BSDF calculation, annual simulation is fast


I would not say there is a recipe. If you have to choose between 1 or 2 CFSs, maybe it is faster to just draw them and use the 2 phase method (or ray-tracing if an annual simulaton is not required). On the contrary, if you are going to test 10 different CFSs, 3 and 5 phases may make sense, since you reduce the expensive ray-tracing calculations... However, this will also depend on weather you have the BSDF data AND/OR if it makes sense to calculate it and store it AND/OR if you intend to simulate a dynamically controlled CFS.

Best!

Dear experts,

I would like to calculate a Daylight Autonomy by annual data of Three-Phase
Method.?

Following the tutorial of McNeil for annual results of illuminance by/
//dctimestep/ command, RGB conversion is not used. I suppose that it is
because it takes a lot of time. If I use RGB conversion as follow:

dctimestep results/photocellsSouthWest.vmx
data/JK_ClearGlass_T70_emis2_0.077_VBlinds.xml results/southwest.dmx
skies/Geneva.smx | rcalc -e "$1=179*($1*0.265+$2*0.670+$3*0.065)" >
results/illum_vb20-smxklemsSW.dat

will I have problems? I would like to manage with sensorpoints x 8760 file.

Thank you in advance.
Kind regards,
Urtza.

Dear Urtza,

If you are working with one of the last Radiance release, you can try the
new command *rmtxop*

*dctimestep.......  | rmtxop -fa -c 47.4 119.9 11.6 > illum.dat *

that allows to convert from irradiance to illuminance values, in a matrix
of size #sensors x 8760.

Take a look at the following presentation  for more details:

Subject: [Radiance-general] accurate rendering of concavities
Message-ID: <55A47A77.2010004@umn.edu>

Dear fellow Radiance users,

Recently, I did an experiment that involved the study of subtly-shaded, 
locally-concave surface patches, including contours that were indirectly 
illuminated in some areas. The problem was, in these deeper regions of 
the object, the ambient lighting term dominated the rendered patch.

In the physical world, there is probabilistically only one darkest 
region (i.e., a single darkest pixel in HDRI) in any particular image of 
a scene. However, with Radiance, I find large patches that share the 
same darkest luminance value, and the subtle shading information is 
lost. In my last experiment, I was able to overcome this problem with a 
hack: I added a large, dim area light for fill. This, in effect, caused 
the cosine reflectance function to dominate the shading values, which is 
not the same as indirect lighting effects caused by inter-reflections 
and contour changes. Unfortunately, although that hack worked for my 
purposes at the time, it would not be the right approach for my current 
project. How does one eliminate this problem in his/her renderings using 
Radiance?

In general, is there a way to recreate an environment using Radiance 
that ensures photometric accuracy in subtly-shaded concave regions of 
convoluted objects (e.g., caused by gradual orientation changes, umbras, 
self-occlusions, and inter-reflections)?

Thank you for your thoughtful considerations.

Sincerely,
Chris Kallie

Did you try rendering first with an "overture" calculation -- create and discard a lower-resolution version of the same image in order to fill the ambient cache?  This sometimes helps.  Also, reducing the -aa value down as low as 0.01 should improve the subtle shading in the indirect regions.

Message-ID: <CAEV5NyfGpoQRF7oT0F6W64rFmn9jJR3PKgpSh9T6_x4sQufKyA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone!
I?ve been learning Radiance and working on Tutorial Two. Now I?m close to
the results, there?re some errors I can?t fixed. There?re quite
straightforward in the terminal, but I have no clue. I?m wondering if
anyone could help me out. Thank you very much in advance.


1) The terminal says: cannot open scene feel ?art_mat.rad?, but I do have
the file in art_lib. After searching all the files with
art_lib/art_mat.rad, I didn?t know what else to do. Additionally, I checked
my .profile and .bashrc, they both have ?.? to the RAYPATH variable.

2) The terminal keeps giving me the errors concerning the views, no matter
da or db. For instance, it says ?bad view? if I linked the view files to
the ones in view_lib directory. If I just wrote down the view in
scene2_d.rif, it gives me ?view up parallel to view direction? (with -vd 0
0 -1 for da). Or ?error in overture for view da? if I changed into -vd 0 1
-1. (\

I?m sharing my files below.
Thank you.

If you create the waves.oct file from the "scene2" directory with the
following command:
   oconv -f art_mat.rad waves.rad >waves.oct
This problem goes away. Otherwise, rpict gets confused as to where the
files waves.oct was built from are located.
  oconv art_lib/art_mat.rad art_lib/waves.rad >art_lib/waves.oct
run from the "scene2" directory also works.

You need a final '-' for rmtxop to read from its standard input.

The best basic Radiance tutorial (not using any of the modern
techniques) is still the one in *Rendering with Radiance* which, um, I
sell.

Drop me a note if you're looking for a copy.

So, do recommend this (radiance tutorial would be enough to start with 3 or 5-phase methods and understanding of BSDF data approach, etc) or advice another tutorial/source for better understanding of radiance basics (using command prompt)?

This way you can run most of the commands exactly as they appear in most of the tutorials out there that are written from a UNIX perspective (as you point out). If you run the "Git BASH shell" you will be able to try out all the multi-phase methods, use and generate BSDFs, etc. Once you have Git for Windows installed, head over to Andy McNeil's tutorials for 3- and 5-phase, fire up the Git BASH shell (it'll be in the Git program group in the Windows start menu), and get started!

Is it similar to the way use in Ecotect/Radiance calculations?

The lack of an image-as-output requirement does not change the fact that ray tracing is a good/convenient algorithm option for daylight simulation problems, especially when dealing with diffusing media and CFS in general.

If you have a geometric model of the CFS you can use Radiance (genBSDF) to make a BSDF of the CFS and use that in a 3- or 5-phase context. However in an annual/climate-based simulation context, you will be stuck with a Klems basis BSDF and that will not be very good resolution for a lot of CFS; here you may want to use the 5-phase method and stick the actual CFS geometry in the building model.

In these cases you could use the 3-phase method. Problem is when you have a BSDF for blinds, and you also want to simulate the blinds-up condition (i.e. clear, specularly transmitting glass). Using a Klems basis BSDF for this is sub-optimal. You end up needing to do two annual simulations, one as 2-phase for the clear glass scenario, and again as a 3-phase (with a blinds BSDF for the transmission matrix) for the blinds down condition. If you have a lot of different window groups, your simulation space can get large in a hurry. But it's still do-able and you can get results that tell a story you simply couldn't tell 5 years ago, informing the newest daylight metrics as well.

If you have to choose between 1 or 2 CFSs, maybe it is faster to just draw them and use the 2 phase method (or ray-tracing if an annual simulaton is not required). On the contrary, if you are going to test 10 different CFSs, 3 and 5 phases may make sense, since you reduce the expensive ray-tracing calculations... However, this will also depend on weather you have the BSDF data AND/OR if it makes sense to calculate it and store it AND/OR if you intend to simulate a dynamically controlled CFS.

Ikrima,

Glad to hear you are up and running!

I agree with Randolph, the RwR textbook is really important grounding in
the basics of Radiance. On the other hand, the newer tutorials written by
Andy McNeil and the Radiance cookbooks by Axel Jacobs (the latter of which
are still available, not to be confused with his original 3-phase
tutorial) will get you up and running on the BSDF stuff which it sounds
like you are anxious to get rolling with. They do assume some familiarity
with the basics, which may trip you up in the beginning, however.

Good luck!

- Rob

Subject: [Radiance-general] rendering with environment maps
Message-ID: <CAKDBSuC2=+_ddOb4x-86pdBw0QKmjpEi2a5msjk29fNveAmAOQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there,

I have a question about rendering with environment maps. I set up a scene
consisting of two spheres, one completely specular and one Lambertian, lit
it with one of Paul Debevec's light probes (
http://www.pauldebevec.com/Probes/). The specular sphere is rendering fine,
but the Lambertian one is turning up completely black, and I have no idea
why.

My code looks like this:

# make environment map
void colorpict uff
9 red green blue uffizi_probe.hdr angmap.cal sb_u sb_v -rx 90
0 0

uff glow uff_glow
0 0 4 1 1 1 0

!genbox uff_glow boxenv 100 100 100 -i | xform -t -50 -50 -50

# make materials
void plastic spec # specular
0 0 5 .5 .5 .5 1.000000 0.000000

void plastic lamb # Lambertian
0 0 5 1 1 1 0.0 0.0

# make spheres
spec sphere sph1 # specular
0 0 4 -.5000000 0.000000 0.000000 0.300000

lamb sphere sph2 # Lambertian
0 0 4  .5000000 0.000000 0.000000 0.300000

I then ran it like this:

oconv scene.rad > scene.oct
rvu -vtv -vv 10 -vh 10 -vp 0 -10 0 scene.oct

When I do this, I get a mirrored sphere and a completely black sphere. To
make sure that the problem wasn't with my code, I downloaded this sample
code from Debevec's website (http://www.pauldebevec.com/RNL/Source/). When
I changed the materials in the .rad file to be Lambertian (lines 182-190 in
rnl_scene.rad), the objects rendered as completely black.

Has anybody ever run into this problem before? I am using RADIANCE 4.2, on
OS X 10.7 (home) and OS X 10.9 (work).

Regards,

MJ

You need to throw in an "-ab 1" (or higher) in the rvu line. The HDR image
does not count as light source and so does not "illuminate" objects with
the default of "-ab 0". If you had more geometry in the scene you would
notice that everything is dark. The only thing you see is the HDR image
itself in direct view or reflected in the sphere (reflection is calculated
independently of the light distribution).

Thomas

Thanks so much for your help, Thomas! That did the trick.

I have two follow-up questions:

(1) When I set the environment map, I also tried including an additional
direct light source. Shouldn't the direct source have illuminated the
Lambertian sphere? I tried setting the intensity of the direct source to be
very high and the environment map to be low, just in case the environment
map was washing out the influence of the direct source -- but still, the
Lambertian sphere rendered completely black. Is it not possible to combine
the environment map with additional light sources?

(2) I want the lighting to be from an environment map, but there to be
additional "environment" that the specular object reflects. More precisely,
I want the specular object to be reflecting a world defined by a texture
pattern, but using the lighting pattern from an environment map. Does that
make sense?

Regards,

MJ

Message-ID: <C0116EE6-B53E-4596-AC13-5D0AAED962DF@relume.com.au>

Hi, 

I?m trying to find the best way to model a perforated aluminium panel and struggling with antimatter materials and such like. Could someone please advise how to do this without ending up with a massive number of surfaces? I haven?t found many examples of how to use the antimatter material apart from the glass lotus in Rendering with Radiance.

My initial assumption was that the panel should be made with genbox then an array of antimatter holes should be added using cylinders of antimatter material, slightly longer than the thickness of the panel. Would it also be possible to genbox the panel then insert tubes into it or would the face of the panel still be present? 

Thanks, 

John Ford.

Hi John,

How big are the holes relative to the thickness of the material?  What percentage of "holiness" does the surface possess, on average?  Are the wholes aligned in a grid or a hexagonal pattern?  Are you going to be in a rendering position where you actually see the holes, or do you just want the correct average behavior with a minimum of noise?

Cheers,
-Greg

Greg, 

The spec at the moment is 4mm thick aluminium with 8mm diameter holes at 12mm pitch in a hexagonal pattern. The open area is 40%. The viewing position is at a distance, so correct average behaviour might work, however I am relying on the inside surface of the holes to reflect light to the viewer, so I?m not sure how using a trans material or suchlike would work in this case. The plan was to render one panel to show effect of being internally when veiwed from below on ground level. 

Thanks, 
John.

OK, this helps.  What you probably want to do is compute the average behavior as a BSDF, which requires explicitly modeling a small section of the material.  You can do this using antimatter to get the holes perfectly cylindrical.  Start with a slab from genbox as you suggested, then use antimatter like so:

void metal aluminum
0
0
5 0.7 0.7 0.7 0.9 0.02

!genbox aluminum slab 140 140 4 | xform -t 0 0 -4.01

void antimatter hole_mat
1 aluminum
0
0

!xform -n even -t 10 10 0 -a 10 -t 12 0 0 -a 6 -t 0 20.78461 0 cylinder.rad

!xform -n odd -t 16 20.392305 0 -a 10 -t 12 0 0 -a 6 -t 0 20.78461 0 cylinder.rad

------------

The file "cylinder.rad" contains:

hole_mat ring cyl.top
0
0
8
	0	0	0
	0	0	1
	0	4

hole_mat cylinder cyl
0
0
7
	0	0	0
	0	0	-4.02
	4

hole_mat ring cyl.bot
0
0
8
	0	0	-4.02
	0	0	-1
	0	4

-----------

You then need to run genBSDF on the whole thing, keeping your sampling region within the appropriate zone:

	genBSDF -t4 5 +geom millimeter +f +b -dim 10 70 10 72.35383 -4.02 0 perf.rad > perf.xml

This creates a tensor tree, which is probably better for this material.  If you need a Klems matrix, just leave off the "-t4 5" setting.

To apply the resulting XML file in a model, you can put this in your rendering file:

void BSDF perf_mat
6 0 perf.xml 0 1 0 .
0
0

perf_mat polygon perf_shelf
0
0
12
	{coordinates in horizontal plane with normal aligned with Z}

-----

I hope this works for you.  If you need the shelf to have a different alignment, just change the "up" orientation for the BSDF (set to XYZ == 0 1 0 in the above example).

Best,
-Greg

Hi

Sorry for replying late. I didn't have time for email yesterday.

1) Perhaps your use of the "glow" material for the environment box stops
the direct calculation from reaching the light source? Can you post the
definition of your light source? I know a combination of HDR mapped to a
sky dome and other light sources can be done but I'm not sure if this works
with a box, too.

2a) You can render the image of the environment map on the reflecting
sphere separately from the main scene and then just combine the two images.
You won't have the lighting pattern on the mirrored object, though. Perhaps
there is a way to capture the lighting pattern with a lambertian material
and multiply the values from both images? You'd have to make sure that your
environment texture captures accurate lighting data.

2b) Instead of reflecting a texture in the mirror ball you could just apply
the texture directly to the mirror. What real-world physical effect do you
want to simulate?

What I have done a few times is to mix a metal or plastic material with
Void. (in this case, 40% void). That passed the few simple tests I made, at
least... but maybe what Greg suggests is more accurate.

My goal is to be able to render a completely specular object in different
scenes ("worlds," let's say), e.g., white noise, 1/f noise, polka dots, &c.
Normally, I would set up a scene thus:

- put the object in the world origin
- place a light source or light sources
- place a giant box around the scene, and texture the inside of the box
with the desired world (e.g., white noise)

But what I actually want to do is use naturalistic lighting, captured from
light probes, hence my question. But maybe this is a nonsensical thing to
do, since the light probes contain scene structure in there? I'm not sure.

Thanks so much for your help!

Regards,

MJ

Dear Radiance/Daysim users,

Some of you might be interested in two new resources for self-learning and/or teaching advanced daylight simulations using Radiance and Daysim via DIVA as well as a student competition.


Learn:? We prepared close to three hours of video tutorials<file:///C:\Users\tito_\Dropbox\Projects\MIT_Website\SustianableDesignLab\projects\DIVATutorials\index.html> for DIVA covering advanced concepts such as annual daylight availability and glare simulations for dynamic facades as well as setting up electric lighting designs and control strategies.
Practice: For teaching and background reading, the tutorials are further linked to several teaching exercises<http://web.mit.edu/sustainabledesignlab/projects/DaylightingHandbook/resources.htm> that we have been using in introductory and advanced classes on daylighting and environmental design. In person DIVA training<http://diva4rhino.com/page/diva-day-2015-training-course-schedule> will be offered in conjunction with DIVA Day on October 22 and 24 at the Architectural Association in London.
Compete: Finally, please alert any of your student contacts of our 2nd DIVA Day student competition<http://diva4rhino.com/diva-day-2015/student-competition>. We want to see how you are using DIVA. The winner(s) will receive a ?1000 stipend to cover travel costs to DIVA Day, free conference registration, and will have their submission displayed during DIVA Day, on 23 October 2015! The submission deadline is September 19.
Happy simulations,
Christoph

I had some time over the weekend to an HDR map applied to a box. The glow
material does indeed block out the light from a directional light source.
You can work around this by using the "source" material type with a 360
degree angle to define a sky dome that has the HDR image applied.

void colorpict sky_map
7 red green blue envmap.hdr skymap.cal map_u map_v
0
1 1.0

sky_map glow sky_mat
0
0
4 1 1 1 0

sky_mat source sky
0
0
4 0 0 1 360

I have uploaded an example scene that contains an image based sky and a
light source. The necessary "skymap.cal" file and a suitable HDR image for
the sky map are included.

https://www.dropbox.com/s/t2d682sm1grrfbx/env_and_light.zip?dl=0

This mapping requires the image to be a rectangular panoramic image. I
think there was a command line to convert the angular HDR images to a
panoramic projection but I couldn't find it.

With this method you can place your object in the scene and place some
additional lights in addition to the lighting embedded in the environment
map. If you want to illuminate the object by a different HDR image than the
environment map you can create a scene and for the lighting and render the
object with clipping planes just before and after the object to remove all
of the lighting map from the image. Then you render the "background" using
the environment map without object and combine both images with pcomb:

pcomb -e 'ro=if(ri(1)-.5,ri(1),ri(2));go=if(gi(1)-.5,gi(1),gi(2));
bo=if(bi(1)-.5,bi(1),bi(2));' \
         object.hdr background.hdr > combined.hdr

You can read more on this here:

Thomas

Subject: [Radiance-general] instructions for compiling pre-releases
Message-ID: <55BB9138.8000301@umn.edu>

Dear Experts,

Could someone direct me to installation instructions for pre-releases 
that were downloaded from github?

I am able to download and compile pre-releases (e.g., version 5.0.a.3) 
without any apparent compiling errors, but when I try to use that 
installation, there are missing programs. How does one use (select and 
combine?) the appropriate release/pre-release files to compile a fully 
functional program suite? Presently, I need the original functionality 
plus the ability to compute caustics (making the latest official release 
insufficient).

I am sure this is a common issue, but without access to a convenient 
source of organized information (i.e., a wiki), I find myself fumbling 
with Google searches and generally lost.

Thanks again,
Chris

What's missing? There may be some missing teeth in the CMake files,
resulting in incomplete installs. To clarify, I assume you want to use the
photon map stuff.(?) Those new programs (mkpmap, etc) are getting built,
but perhaps the "install" target is not quite right. So: what platform are
you trying to do this on, what is your workflow, and what is missing or
not working? Apologies that there aren't instructions for using the CMake
stuff in the Radiance source; it's on the list of things to do. Basically
you use CMake to generate the makefiles, and then just use make like
normal.

You could also use the "makeall" csh script which comes with the source
and is maintained by Greg (and probably Roland now too). That guy has has
always been pretty bulletproof on unix systems. Andy's YouTube vid on
installing Radiance on OSX demonstrates the use of the makeall script; the
process is basically the same for Linux:
