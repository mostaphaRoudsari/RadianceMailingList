Message-ID: <CAChZdE3gqgudGP8hMGLbffk7-UyP-J48i1ouVjJh9t4Q2XU6sg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there,

I'm new here and actually I'm doing interior visualiyations with a proper
IES light, and in some cases I need to tilt them or rotate, and I realized
that is not allowed. I searched then for some tilted files but there are
not existing for my luminaries.
Can I ask, If there is any programe to tilt the actuall IES file and than
put it into Radiance or is there any possibility to rotate or tilt an IES
file in Radiance ? Any tips and hints?

Thanks a lot
Kind regards,

Peter Zatko

Hi Peter,

I am assuming you have Type C photometry files, perhaps some for a directional, amiable luminaire like a track fixture or something like that. In this case you would convert the ies file to radiance format using ies2ead, and then do your tilting and rotating using the Radiance xform utility to do translations.

See:
http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/man_html/ies2rad.1.html
and
http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/man_html/xform.1.html

There are also extensive examples of how to aim luminaries in Rob Shakespeare's art gallery tutorial in Rendering With Radiance.

hth,

- Rob

The xform command can shift, rotate, tilt, and array the .rad file definition that gets created from ies2rad. Please write again if you have any trouble finding the manual page for it.

The .rad file that comes from ies2rad represents the geometry of the IES file ? and makes reference to a data translation of the luminaire intensity. You should also get such a .dat file out of ies2rad, but shouldn?t have to perform any actions on this because it?s a data reference into the .rad file rather than a geometry that must be rotated.

There?s also the replmarks command which can be helpful for locating light sources if you?re exporting a model from some other modeling software.

Dear Axel and Vlad, thank you very much for your suggestions!

Vlad's advice works: change the "-i" option to "-ip", and I got the
following:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/m3fq6ilbic5n6in/gendaylit_fc.hdr?dl=0

Maybe the falsecolor I'm using is actually "falsecolor2" which use the "-i"
option when specifying an hdr image file ....

Apologize for my late reply!

Joe

Thanks, Joe.  The fc image you put up on Dropbox was created with the
old palette, which is available in the latest falsecolor.pl with the
'-pal spec' option.  You're using either an older official version, or
falsecolor2 (not sure what the default palette is there).

Anyhow, I'm glad it's all working for you

Best

Axel

Subject: [Radiance-general] Question: epw file --> gencumulativesky (ish)
 -->rendering --> pfilt --> falsecolor --> Analysis
Message-ID: <CAF-iH4Lo2Mb9nb-6vWSG7sJkVmFdMaKycCncGiD9vB7Z=5QY6g@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Everyone,

I am trying to use gencumulativesky, but I have encounter some issues that
I would like to share, just in case anyone can help me... I searched a
while, but I found nothing like really useful.

My doubts are basically in every step, haha... sorry this will be long.


   - *gencumulativesky*

I compiled gencumulativesky as mentioned in the "Readme" file, and it
worked perfectly well. However, when I intended to use it,
*I got a segmentation fault. what could be causing it?*

My data was obtained from an EPW file, obtaining 8760 lines organized in
two columns (Global Horizontal and Diffuse Horizontal Radiation) separated
with tabs:
0    0
0    0
0    0
0    0
0    0
3    3
69    61
267    155
...

When I found out it did not work, I thought on an alternative option that I
would like to know if it is ok.

What I did was to generate de daymtx (i.e. gendaymtx -O1 -...) and then,
using a perl script, add all the values for each bin, obtaining a vector...
then, write it on a .cal file (based on Reinhart.cal) as:

{   MODIFIED WARD's REINHART.CAL

    AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED USING cSKY by GERMAN MOLINA
}

...

rbin = if (-alt, 0, raccum(r_row) + r_azn + 1);

...

skybright = select(rbin,bin1, bin2, bin3, ...... binN); {this is the vector}

I am using a gray sky, so the patch value added considers only the red
channel... that is, the value of bin1, bin2, bin3, etc. is the sum of all
the red values for each bin along the year (i.e. not doing the
179*(R*0.265+G*0.67+B*0.065))

   - *rendering*

I am rendering using rpict -i+

   -
*pfilt *

As mentioned in the documentation provided with gencumulativesky, I had to
modify the -h option for it to work... *Does that affect my results?* (i.e.
units)

   - *falsecolor*

Here I am just applying Falsecolor doing:

falsecolor -l kWh/m2 -s a -m 0.001 #change the multiplier in order to get
kWh

   - *Analysis*

Doing this... are my units correct?


That is basically it.

Here are picture of some results
<https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B2NfkTSl19hQaXo2TmNiX0ZJcEk&usp=sharing>...
I do not even know if the values make sense...

THANKS VERY MUCH IN ADVANCE, SORRY FOR THE LONG E-MAIL

Germ?n

	colorpict
Message-ID: <op.xu4j7mh48kpuas@xn--niko-stationr-mfb>

Hey i am right now trying to visualize a TV screen in radiance. For a
better visual impression i have created an Imaging layer using the
colorpict material.
looking like this:

void colorpict imagin_layer
9 red green blue forestfl.pic . frac(U) frac(V) -s 2
0
0

imagin_layer trans image
0
0
7 1 1 1 0 0 1 0

when this is rendered the material is divided into small samples giving an
odd pattern.
here a picture of the rendering:
http://api.ning.com/files/7F975s5rOKhNOb-MzrDw-IgT*9VAIHqtJ-jdmmewN42*lfsh9FDJX2BIr5Chxy1EG5VXoec5toLZlOaGexMtx8LzXqDF9y3t/Test_lightsource_highres_4096_.15_1024_2.bmp

This is a picture rendering using the standard settings for the high
resolution rendering in diva, except for -ad 4096 -ds 0.15 and -as 1024.
The setup is one imported light source behind the transparent colorpict
material.  I have already tried using the ds/dj parameters without luck,
the subdivision seams fixed. Also changing the -n parameter when creating
the .oct file has not worked.

I have tried various combinations of -ad -as -ds -dj and -ps until now.
i hope someone can help.

Niko

not sure it is the issue you have but if you use an image to light and this has multiple colour and it is a glow is very difficult to avoid splotches.
you get better results with -aa 0 (at a cost time wise) or by running a Greg script that converts an image in a series of light sources (look for sky imaging lighting)
Hope this helps

Hi Niko,

It is difficult to understand what is going on with your scene based on your description.  Can you post the actual scene (with light source), plus with the rpict command you used to generate the image?

Thanks!

Hi Niko,

if you are using the light modifier, it seems you are reaching the maximum
number of 64 source subdivisions (set in source.h). For these cases I would
suggest to follow Guilio's proposal and use the glow modifier instead and
work on the parameters to properly handle rendering time.

Best,
David

Message-ID: <CAFNnwkv+kfW5aSy=UqG4zMgtAbq7_7jH3TTVB3q3gUzDr=n6Jw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear experts,
I try to create a handmade, virtual weather file for a complete year of
wonderfull clear skies. The goal is a direct-insolation study, somehow the
maximum potential for a given site. So I am interested only in direct and
diffuse irradiance values in the fake .epw.
A) Is there a nice way to create a fake .epw for an arbitrary location for
clear sky all year long? (I would head for looping through the year with
gensky, but that's brute. And the following steps, rework of my fuzzy
concept are unclear to me, today.)
B) What would you suggest for sizing down the timesteps in the epw....
dctimestep calculation (two.phase method...thx to andy' s pdf and David).
The insulation study should give data more frequently than hourly.

Many thanks,
Robert

Subject: [Radiance-general] 3-phase method daylight matrix
Message-ID: <41DA8B9A-67CE-4AED-A3BF-444285EA6AA8@lunet.lboro.ac.uk>

Dear all

I have a couple of questions about the 3 phase method, I haven?t used it much before so I?d like to be sure of what I?m doing.

1. I have a multi aspect room, so I divided the windows in two groups, depending on their orientation, each group with its own modifier (is it alright even if they are in the same file?). In this way, the first run of rfluxmtx automatically produces two view matrices. The second run, for the daylight matrix, works well either if I use the same single file with all the windows in it or if I create two separate rad files for the two orientations, but the final illuminance results are somehow different (lower for the first option, higher for the second). I am carrying on with the two separate files, because of something reported in the older version of the 3-phase method tutorial about this, but I?d like to know if it?s the right way to go.

The ambient parameters I?m using are:
-ab 12 -ad 50000 -lw 2e-5	(for the view matrix)
-ab 2 -ad 5000 -lw 2e-4		(for the daylight matrix)

Also, when at the end I have one illuminance file per orientation, is it correct just to add them together using the rmtxop addition?

2. As well as the transmission matrix, all the other matrices in the rmtxop multiplication can be substituted if I am changing only one condition, right? e.g. if I?m testing different grid resolutions I am changing only the view matrix and if I use different time steps I?ll change only the sky matrix.

Thanks a lot in advance!
Eleonora

Hi Eleanora,

I'm not sure I'm understanding your question fully, but you can have multiple *receivers* in the same file to generate multiple matrices using rfluxmtx.  However, if you wish to use those receivers (i.e., your window surfaces) as *senders* in a subsequent run (i.e., for the exterior daylight coefficients), then you must have them in separate files for multiple runs of rfluxmtx.

It is probably poor program design on my part, but currently, rfluxmtx ignores the materials in a sender file, and just puts them all together as a single "average" surface.  This gives unintended results if you give it two well-separated windows of different orientations, and this is possibly the source of your errors.

For optimal efficiency using rfluxmtx for 3-phase, it is better to have separate files for your different elevation windows, with different modifiers in each.  For example, you might have:

east_windows.rad	(using "east_window_mat" to modify all the surfaces)
west_windows.rad	(using "west_window_mat")
south_windows.rad	(using "south_window_mat")

This would allow you to do the necessary 3 separate runs of rfluxmtx to compute the contribution from each elevation's windows for the external daylight coefficients.  Then, you could have a combined "receivers.rad" file that contains the following single line:

!xform east_windows.rad west_windows.rad south_windows.rad

You would give this one-line file to a single run of rfluxmtx to compute the three interior flux transform matrix for your sensors.

Does this help?

Cheers,
-Greg

P.S.  I will see if I can add a warning message for sender files with multiple modifiers, as this seems such an easy mistake to make!

Hi all,

I'm running a three phase method analysis and am running into some funny behaviour. I generated windows using Honeybee msh2rad, converting a Rhino mesh to a radiance geometry file via TurtlePyMesh & obj2rad.

When I generate my view matrix, it works fine for some windows, but not for others - and there's no clear difference in geometry between those that work and those that don't work. My command is:
                Rfluxmtx -ab 4 -ad 5000 -y 81 < ChEast.pts - windows_pts/window_04.rad material.rad ChEast.rad > viewpts_04.mtx

And the error I get is:
rcontrib: fatal - duplicate modifer 'M-nor'

My daylight and sky matrices work for fine for all of the windows, so I don't know what it is. Any idea what can cause this kind of behaviour? Does rfluxmtx need perfectly flat / regularly shaped objects?

Thanks,
Reinier

Thanks Greg, it does help!

It is like I thought and did at the end. And the xform line will be a nice addition to my script.

A warning message could probably be useful for newbies like me.

Hi Eleanora,

I'll respond to your other questions since Greg handled the first one.

Yes, you can add the illuminance files from each window group using rmtxop
to get the combined illuminance from both window groups.


2. As well as the transmission matrix, all the other matrices in the rmtxop

Yes, that is correct.

Hi Reinier,

Are you being sure to group your same-material surfaces together when passing them to rfluxmtx?  The program isn't smart enough to group them for you, and I suppose this requirement needs to be mentioned explicitly in the man page.  That was an oversight on my part...

If your receiver surfaces are already grouped by modifier and you are getting this error, send me your files off-list and I will see if I can figure out what's going on.

Cheers,
-Greg

The next major release of OpenStudio (v 1.7.0, to be released at the end of March) does all of this work for you automatically. The basic workflow is in the current iteration release, in fact; OpenStudio will take an OpenStudio model and group all the window polygons by orientation, transmittance, and shading control, and all the required rfluxmtx headers are written to the window input files. This is all in OpenStudio v1.6.3. While there was an issue in the annual simulation workflow in v1.6.3, this has been fixed for v1.7.0 (and can be downloaded from the OpenStudio GitHub today).

Hello All,
I have been put in an unusual situation of convincing someone that radiance
is better and more scientifically accurate at simulating a daylighting
scene which includes large application of translucent glazing. I haven't
used AGI 32 at all to understand the nuances myself.

Could someone please provide salient features comparing the two and/or
point me to the correct resources? What I have found online hasn't been
convincing. May be I am not searching in the right place.

So that you know, the audience is not technically sound. But understands
light well in the architectural context.

Thanks in advance,

Shri

Hi Shri,

Perhaps you know this already, but the major difference between AGI
and Radiance is that AGI uses radiosity rather than raytracing to
calculate light, and therefore does not calculate specularity or
specular light transmission. You can raytrace individual views in AGI,
but that applies Ray tracing to the direct component only and it does
not affect any calculated point grids. Qualitatively, visualizations
are less true to life. Ability to control your calculation parameters
in AGI is also limited.

Another limitation with AGI is the ability to define complex
materials. In general the parameters are limited to tramsittance or
transparency and color. There is an option to add a texture, but I
think these are just image maps, although I would have to check. If
you are planning on using a complex definition for your materials, AGI
does not support that.

Lastly, AGI doesn't support climate-based metrics/annual calculations or DGP.

I have heard that there are several papers and studies out there that
try to compare AGI, Radiance, and other softwares, but I don't have
any specific reference to give you.

None of this is to say that AGI is not accurate, especially within
it's given capabilities, and in your case if the translucent material
you are using is 100% diffusing, and you do not need to address
specularity, daylight autonomy or DGP, you would likely get reasonable
results as far as the light transmission through the glazing. But in
the end, Radiance has much greater capacity to simulate daylight,
glare, materials, etc.

I hope that helps,
Kera

Wow Kera, all that info, and from your iPhone?! Impressive. Kera hit all
the points, I think. I would only add that I think AGI *can* produce
pretty convincing images, within the limitations of the radiosity approach
(i.e. no true specular reflection model). In fact the brains behind AGI
(Ian Ashdown) recently contributed to a thread on a LinkedIn forum about
how AGI is the only commercial lighting simulation tool that can render
chromatic adaptation (constancy), which is pretty damned impressive and
goes along way toward "true to life" renderings.

Shri, your specific case of wanting accuracy in the translucent realm is
what finally drove me from Radiance dabbler to Radiance user many moons
ago. Since then however, AGI has matured quite a bit. In my book, the
inability to do climate based simulations and metrics is a non-starter,
though.

Hi Greg,

Thanks. And yes, they're all the same material, so I don't think that's it.

I'll send you the files off-list - thanks for taking a look.

Are you being sure to group your same-material surfaces together when passing them to rfluxmtx?  The program isn't smart enough to group them for you, and I suppose this requirement needs to be mentioned explicitly in the man page.  That was an oversight on my part...

If your receiver surfaces are already grouped by modifier and you are getting this error, send me your files off-list and I will see if I can figure out what's going on.

Hi all,

Feedback from some off-list communication: after some help from Greg:
	You need to run it again using the -f of obj2rad during your conversion.  The issue is that obj2rad inserts textures between the material modifier 	and the surfaces, which confuses rfluxmtx (and rcontrib).  If you add the -f option, it should eliminate the issue.
the script works, rfluxmtx behaviour is back to normal!

Hi Kera and Rob,

Thanks a lot both for your input! I was only aware of the two items.
1. Radiosity vs. Raytracing
2. Limitations in modeling specular reflection

Good to know the details.

Hi Robert,

using gensky in that case would not really be brute force. You can use Radiance's cnt tool to provide you with intervals of any wanted duration, translate these into time stamps as expected by gensky using the unix date command, and generate the sky vector from gensky's output. That allows you to easily apply the three-phase method using the synthetic sky distributions.

Cheers, Lars.

Dear colleagues and friends in the Bay Area,

Some of you might be interested in two back-to-back events at the Pacific Energy Center<http://www.pge.com/en/mybusiness/services/training/pec/index.page> in San Francisco on April 8 and 9. On Wednesday, April 8th at 6.30PM, I will be giving an overview lecture on daylighting<https://pge-web.ungerboeck.com/classcalendar/Details.aspx?OrgCode=10&EventId=11612> covering topics from rules of thumb for urban massing studies to a review of a century of daylight modelling techniques. On April 9th the center will host a full day workshop on daylight simulations. Details and registration information for the latter can be found here<http://registration.daylightinghandbook.com/>. Please RSVP for either event.

Enjoy your weekend,

Hi Christopher,
This event sounds fantastic, however, unfortunately I am based in the UK.
Would there be any online discussion /presentations on this?
Thanks Rosemary

Subject: [Radiance-general] dctimestep fatal error
Message-ID: <CAOn=hKEnx8RW8hR+Wi7Cv3TkjA9Sj-rfmLtEEkRbAt5rSoEQfg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear expert,


I am working with the new 3-phase method arrangement. At the last step,
when I try to run dctimestep for the annual simulation I got an error: "*fatal
? unexpected EOF reading Bolzano.smx"*



Here my command:

dctimestep -n 8760 data/window_up.vmx data/bsdf/cfs.xml data/window_up.dmx
bolzano.smx > results.dat



All the matrices seems to have the right dimensions for the multiplication:

SMX (NCOMP=3, NROWS=146, NCOLS=8670)

DMX (NCOMP=3, NROWS=145, NCOLS=146)

BSDF (145x145)

VMX (NCOMP=3, NROWS=16, NCOLS=145)



Last thing, If I use h=r1 for in the sky definition in the receiver (as
shown in the Andy?s presentation at last Radiance workshop) I got a
warning: "bad bin number (ignored)?


Where I am getting wrong?

Thanks in advance,
*Giuseppe *

If you have a header in your bolzano.smx file,  you should not use the -n option, which implies no header.  This is a new "feature" of dctimestep to simplify operation and make it more consistent with the behavior of other tools.  The default output of gendaymtx now produces a header, unless the -h option is used.

As for the bad bin number, the latest HEAD should report the number being ignored.  There may have been other fixes to the software since then, however, and it would be a good idea to get current with the latest HEAD.  If you get the error again, at least it will report the number so we can figure out what's happening.

Hope this helps!
-Greg

Dear Greg,

your help is always decisive! It was a question of release, now all work
fine both with dctimestep and hemisphere subdivsion.


Thanks again,
Giuseppe
