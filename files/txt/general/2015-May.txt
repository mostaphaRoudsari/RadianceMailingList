Indeed, there has been quite a bit of debate about the EFA guidelines in particular, and climate-based daylight modelling in general.  Axel's views on these developments are detailed in an article he wrote for the Lighting Journal last September (see pages 15-17):

http://issuu.com/matrixprint/docs/lightingjournal_september

I've attempted to respond to these and similar concerns in a paper recently presented at the CIBSE Technical Symposium (16th April 2015).  Titled "Climate-based daylight modelling and its discontents" it should be freely available for download from the CIBSE website:

Drop me a line if you have difficulty getting hold of it.

Hi Jasper,

I briefly looked at your image - for sure you get a low DGP value if 
your illuminance at camera (or eye) level is only about 300lux... It is 
not the matter of the fish eye lens it is a matter of your lighting 
condition.
When I remember correctly, for the experiments I did for my PhD, the 
people adjusted the blinds in a way, that they had 2500-3000 lux at the 
eye level and they were less than 20% of them dissatisfied. So a value 
of 300 means one order of magnitude less light at the eye level and a 
much lower adaptation level.
So I definitely understand the low DGP value in that case. The images 
themselves look reasonable, so I don't think there is a problem in 
calibration/processing so far (at least not for these low luminance 
levels-it might be more tricky to calibrate for the high luminance 
values when you get stray-light from the multiple lenses).

If all your images are like that it means you have a very low daylight 
contribution at the place you measure. I'm not sure if DGP is then the 
right way to measure glare in that case - as I wrote it is made more for 
the daylight oriented workplace with higher levels and also to take into 
account very high luminances (e.g. sun or specular reflections of the 
sun). DGP might be modified in future, but these experiments are just 
starting.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Pipe Transmission Matrix in 3 Phase Method
Message-ID: <DUB128-W84E6AAC37CB42FAE18D8C3FCD30@phx.gbl>

Hello,
I am trying the 3 phase method example of the pipe that Andy made in the presentation. I am doing it using the sensor points method. It went smooth in the (Daylight Matrix, View Matrix, both BSDF.xml files) however there is a problem in the "pipe transmission matrix".
I am not sure when he meant in this line:
rfluxmtx -n 8 -ab 12 -ad 1000 -lw 1e-4 objects/LP_bottom.rad objects/LP_top.rad materials_glow.rad objects/LP_sides.rad  > results/LP_trans.mtx
whether i should give the pipe a glow material or should i give it to the "top part" the glow material?
Another thing, do I have to insert the whole model.rad or the Light pipe sides should work fine?
I tried several options:
giving the sides a glow material, however when it ran it gave me several errors and a warning
rfluxmtx: internal - sample behind all sender elements!rcontrib: warning - partial accumulation in final recordrcontrib: fatal - unexpected EOF on input
I wish I could know why each error appears.
But in the end it generates a matrix file but the numbers inside seems irrational as they are all nx10^-5

However when I put glow materials to the top of the pipe only it gives me the following warning:
rcontrib: warning - aiming failure for light source "ttttttttt.nnn" t= text n=numbers
and it seems to be frozen and does not generate any matrix.
Is there any advice on what should be done to generate a pipe matrix and what materials to use?
Thanks for you assistance,Islam Mashaly.

Dear Greg,

Thank you very much!

Hope you and the list can shed light on the following question about *Spectral
Fraction* value in Fluent solar load model based on your explanation:

In * Fluent *(CFD simulation software) menu for its *solar load
model*, the *spectral
fraction *is defined as the* fraction of incident solar radiation in the
visible part of the solar radiation spectrum*, which is calculated as *V
(the visible incident solar radiation)* divided by *V+IR (the total
incident solar radiation , visible plus infrared).*

I'd like to ask if the following calculation using Radiance is correct
(using Singapore's epw weather file, Mar-20, 3pm as an example):

*Step 1:* get the global horizontal irradiance (full spectrum, in wh/m2)


*gendaylit  3 20 15 -a 1.37 -o -103.98 -m -120 -W 447.0 378.0  -O 1   >
 ./gendaylit.skyoconv ./gendaylit.sky ./gendaylit_sky.rad >
./gendaylit_sky.oct*

*echo 0 0 0 0 0 1 | rtrace -w -h -I+ -ab 1 ./gendaylit_sky.oct | rcalc -e
"$1=$1*0.265+$2*0.670+$3*0.065" >
./gendaylit_global_horizontal_irradiance_in_Wh-m^2.txt*

The content of the gendaylit_sky.rad file, which describes the sky
geometry, is:

skyfunc glow sky_glow

0

0

4 1 1 1 0

sky_glow source sky

0

0
4 0 0 1 180

The output is: *771.593 (wh/m2)*,


* which is close to 799 wh/m2 (global_horizontal_radiation) reported in the
epw file.*
*Step 2: *
*get the global horizontal irradiance (integrated over the visible
spectrum, in wh/m2) *
The three commands are basically the same except that the [-O] option of
gendaylit is set as [-O 0]*:*
*gendaylit  3 20 15 -a 1.37 -o -103.98 -m -120 -W 447.0 378.0  -O 0   >
 ./gendaylit_visible.sky*

*oconv ./gendaylit_visible.sky ./gendaylit_sky.rad >
./gendaylit_sky_visible.oct*

*echo 0 0 0 0 0 1 | rtrace -w -h -I+ -ab 1 ./gendaylit_sky_visible.oct |
rcalc -e "$1=$1*0.265+$2*0.670+$3*0.065" >
./gendaylit_global_horizontal_irradiance_visible_in_Wh-m^2.txt*

The output is: 465.338 (wh/m2), which corresponds to global horizontal
illuminance of 465.388*179(lm/w) = 83304 (lux), which is close to 89300lux
(global_horizontal_illuminance) as reported in epw file.

So, the Spectral Fraction for Mar-20, 3pm is *465.338 / *

*771.593 = 0.603*
Is it correct?

Hello,
I have a question about acrylic materials. i wanna to modelling a
trapezoidal shape with acrylic material. I hope Radiance can simulate the
behaviour of light direction, such as refraction dan internal reflection.

 I have tried to give dielectric material, but failed.
and then i wanna give a prism material, but in prism materials the shape
must be a planar shape. but the shape that i want is trapezoidal.
the image of example room with shading acrylic can be downloaded in

Hi David,

This looks correct to me.  There is probably an easier way to get the result based directly on the output of gendaylit, but I'm not familiar enough with this program to say which parameters in the file correspond to global irradiance.

Cheers!

Therefore, we normally include an "efficacy" calculation that converts the EPW's radiometric values into these semi-photometric values.  (It's a bit confusing, but suffice it to say that Radiance's units have a relation to photometric units that employs a predefined efficacy/conversion value of 179 lumens/watt.)

Hi Christy,

This is a case where you may need to use genBSDF to create a virtual system using your prismatic panel, which can be modeled with the genprism command.  You need to pay careful attention to the man page:

	http://www.radiance-online.org/learning/documentation/manual-pages/pdfs/genprism.pdf

In particular, the direction you extrude the surface determines the orientation of the normals, which matters for the dielectric material type.

Following genprism, you can use the xform command with a -a option to repeat the extruded prism as many times as needed with the appropriate positioning (-t option).

The genBSDF command can be used with pkgBSDF to place the final system into your scene.

You could also try rendering using the new photon map routines that have been recently added to the Radiance HEAD by Roland Schregle, but this is only if you have the most up-to-date binaries.

Unfortunately, none of these steps are simple, and this is a good challenge for an advanced Radiance user.  It would probably take me several hours to do, myself.

Cheers,
-Greg

Hello,
I have a question about acrylic materials. i wanna to modelling a trapezoidal shape with acrylic material. I hope Radiance can simulate the behaviour of light direction, such as refraction dan internal reflection. 




I have tried to give dielectric material, but failed.

and then i wanna give a prism material, but in prism materials the shape must be a planar shape. but the shape that i want is trapezoidal.

Going by the man page, the rpict option is just "-ap" not "-apg", though that is the correct option for mkpmap.

Try it!

Hi all,

I have a problem with my .xml files obtained by genBSDF. I obtain a weird
data format in Reflection scattering data section. This is an example:
 0.13983950.13990250.14006050.13999150.14011450.... etc. Various numbers,
that compose the matrix are not split by comma like in trasmission matrix.
I ran the analysis in Ubuntu with these parameters:  *genBSDF -n 2 -c 20000
-r -dj 1 -ds 0.01 -dt 0.05 -dc 0.99 -dr 50 -ss 100 -st 0.0001 -ab 10 -ar
128 -aa 1 -ad 2054 -lr 50 -lw 0.0000000001*

Therefore, I really appreciate if anyone can help me to create a right bsdf
both in trasmission and in reflection data.
Thanks so much.

Best

Hi Urtza,

The problem is the use of double-quotes for  "vwrays -vtv -vh 94 -vv 70 -vp 1.5 5 1.75 -vd 0 -1 0 -x 600 -y 600 -d", which used singe back-quotes under Unix.  This replaces the command with its output on the command line, something Windows does not do.  Substituting with double-quotes is the wrong thing to do.  Instead, execute this command yourself, then cut and paste the output into the rcontrib command line in its place.

The output is "-x 600 -y 392 -ld-", so you would use:

	vwrays -ff -vf -vtv -vh 94 -vv 70 -vp 1.5 5 1.75 -vd 0-1 0 -x 600 -y 600 | rcontrib -x 600 -y 392 -ld- -ffc -fo -o vmx/window_%03d.hdr -f klems_ang.cal -b kbinS -bn Nkbins -m windowglow -ab 2 12 -ad 50000 -lw 2e-5 model_vmx.oct

As the actual command in Windows.

Cheers,
-Greg

Subject: [Radiance-general] using transdata for roller shade simulation
Message-ID: <FF7DBAB281C1A94F80CCEC1896041532BB1285AE@SDCEMB01.unibz.it>

Hi all,
I'm a pretty new in Radiance use and I'm thinking about the possibility to use transdata in order to simulate a roller shade.
Looking into the mailing list, I found some post in which has been suggested to use the trans material to simulate roller shades, but doing so I would lose the directionality properties of the real material.
If I'm not wrong with transdata I should be able to change the A6 parameter, through a .dat file, according to the different values of beam-beam transmittance at different incidence angles.
I know that it's not possible to do the same thing with the beam-diffuse component, so I would have thought to express Td, diffuse transmissivity, as the sum of diffuse-diffuse plus beam-diffuse transmittance, the latter calculated as an average on the incidence angles.

Does it make sense for you?

Best regards,

Anna

Hi Anna,

The transdata (and transfunc) materials do not fully model material behavior as well as the newer BSDF type (or even BRTDfunc).

I have a few models of roller shades, which you might be able to modify to your purpose.  I do not (currently) have any measurements to offer.

-Greg

Hi Greg,
and thank you for your super quick response!
At the moment I can't implement in my simulation the BSDF type since I'm using Radiance via DIVA, and the actual Daysim version implemented in DIVA doesn't support BSDF type for the annual calculation.
This was the reason for whose I thought to use transdata.
Instead the BRTDfunc seems to work. I tried to run an annual simulation and it seems like nothing wrong happened.

So, I've only to understand how BRTDfunc exactly works. Any suggestion will be very appreciate!

Thank you,

Anna

Hi Anna,

Other than the source code(!), we just have the Radiance reference manual:

	http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/ray.html#Materials

Here's what it says about BRTDfunc:

BRTDfunc
The material BRTDfunc gives the maximum flexibility over surface reflectance and transmittance, providing for spectrally-dependent specular rays and reflectance and transmittance distribution functions.
        mod BRTDfunc id
        10+  rrefl  grefl  brefl
             rtrns  gtrns  btrns
             rbrtd  gbrtd  bbrtd
             funcfile  transform
        0
        9+   rfdif gfdif bfdif
             rbdif gbdif bbdif
             rtdif gtdif btdif
             A10 ..
The variables rrefl, grefl and brefl specify the color coefficients for the ideal specular (mirror) reflection of the surface. The variables rtrns, gtrns and btrns specify the color coefficients for the ideal specular transmission. The functions rbrtd, gbrtd and bbrtd take the direction to the incident light (and its solid angle) and compute the color coefficients for the directional diffuse part of reflection and transmission. As a special case, three identical values of '0' may be given in place of these function names to indicate no directional diffuse component.
Unlike most other material types, the surface normal is not altered to face the incoming ray. Thus, functions and variables must pay attention to the orientation of the surface and make adjustments appropriately. However, the special variables for the perturbed dot product and surface normal, RdotP, NxP, NyP and NzP are reoriented as if the ray hit the front surface for convenience.

A diffuse reflection component may be given for the front side with rfdif, gfdif and bfdif for the front side of the surface or rbdif, gbdif and bbdif for the back side. The diffuse transmittance (must be the same for both sides by physical law) is given by rtdif, gtdif and btdif. A pattern will modify these diffuse scattering values, and will be available through the special variables CrP, CgP and CbP.

Care must be taken when using this material type to produce a physically valid reflection model. The reflectance functions should be bidirectional, and under no circumstances should the sum of reflected diffuse, transmitted diffuse, reflected specular, transmitted specular and the integrated directional diffuse component be greater than one.

Islam,

Sorry for my delayed response. I used a glow material for generating the
pipe transmission matrix.

your error "rfluxmtx: internal - sample behind all sender elements!"
indicates that you probably have either the sender or receiver surface
normal reversed.  You need to make sure that the surface normal of the
object at the top of your pipe (your receiver) faces into the pipe. And the
surface normal of the surface at the bottom of your pipe (sender) should
face outside of your pipe.

Hi Greg,
I read the description. Thank you for the references.
I have only a question about the shades description that you sent me with your first email. In all the cases the color coefficients for the directional diffuse, which I suppose should be the beam to diffuse component of the incident light, have been imposed equal to 0.
If I wanted modify them according to the incident angle values, I have "simply" to insert the specific correlation inside the .cal file?

Thank you

Anna

Hi Greg,
and thank you for your super quick response!
At the moment I can't implement in my simulation the BSDF type since I'm using Radiance via DIVA, and the actual Daysim version implemented in DIVA doesn't support BSDF type for the annual calculation.
This was the reason for whose I thought to use transdata.
Instead the BRTDfunc seems to work. I tried to run an annual simulation and it seems like nothing wrong happened.

So, I've only to understand how BRTDfunc exactly works. Any suggestion will be very appreciate!

Thank you,

Anna

Hi Anna,

The transdata (and transfunc) materials do not fully model material behavior as well as the newer BSDF type (or even BRTDfunc).

I have a few models of roller shades, which you might be able to modify to your purpose.  I do not (currently) have any measurements to offer.

Best,

Hello Everyone, 

I an architect and am doing a glare analysis and need to accurately simulate different finishes of stainless steel as options. 
I am currently using the following material definition to simulate Stainless Steel w #4 Finish:

# material name:STAINLESS_4
# material type: reflective 
# comment: stainless_4

Im looking to simulate the following types of metal using the the appropriate different specular and roughness values, but don't have any way to accurately test the materials my self
I have had a very hard time finding this information, and do not have the equipment to measure actual samples. 

1) Stainless Steel Polished
2) Stainless Steel #4 finish
3) Stainless Steel Sandblasted
4) Zinc 

Does anyone have any thoughts what the reflectance/roughness values for these type of materials and finishes may be?  Thanks so much for any help

 points with luminaires in a room
Message-ID: <B7C7EC576E73DA4791A2956F99AE30BF462A5CBB@fgdemucimp01exc.ads.fraunhofer.de>

Hello Radiance community,

I have a room with a few luminaires (no daylight) and given measurement points, and want to have the transfer matrix (influence of each luminaire on each measurement point) for this room.

Since a few days I am trying around with rfluxmtx but got stuck in an error message: "missing receiver surface!"

I'm using radiance on windows with no gui.
I made a batch file to call:
oconv szene.rad lights.rad > szene.oct
rfluxmtx -I+ szene.oct @szene.opt - lights.rad < messpunkte.xyz > koeffizientenmatrix.mtx


in szene.rad I used #@rfluxmtx h=u before some polygons where the measurement points (messpunkte.xyz) are.

Szene.opt is: -I+ -h -dp 512 -ar 128 -ds .15 -dj .7 -dt .05 -dc .5 -dr 3 -ss .7 -st .1 -ab 0 -aa .1 -ad 512 -as 256 -lr 10 -lw .002 -av 0 0 0

Lights.rad positions the luminaires with xform and calls #@rfluxmtx h=u before each.
#@rfluxmtx h=u
!xform -n L1_direkt        -t 1.21 2.6 2.6                    k_direkt.rad
#@rfluxmtx h=u
!xform -n L2_direkt        -t 3 2.6 2.6                          k_direkt.rad
...

I also tried to write #@rfluxmtx h=u inside the k_direkt.rad luminaire file, no difference.

Feels like I tried every combination I can imagine for the luminaires and polygons but it just won't work.
I have attached the files.

Does anyone have an idea or has a working example I could learn from?

Thanks,
Berat

Hi Anna,

The "directional diffuse" portion is in fact not diffuse from beam; it is the scattering that is *neither* purely specular nor purely diffuse.  If you wish to manipulate the amount of diffuse scattering, use the first 9 real arguments of the BRTDfunc type for the different components, front diffuse reflection, back diffuse reflection, and diffuse transmission.

The "directional diffuse" portions have to be defined as functional procedures using the *.cal language, and should not be necessary in this case.

Cheers,
-Greg

The variables rtrns, gtrns and btrns specify the color coefficients for the ideal specular transmission. The functions rbrtd, gbrtd and bbrtd take the direction to the incident light (and its solid angle) and compute the color coefficients for the directional diffuse part of reflection and transmission. As a special case, three identical values of '0' may be given in place of these function names to indicate no directional diffuse component.

The diffuse transmittance (must be the same for both sides by physical law) is given by rtdif, gtdif and btdif. A pattern will modify these diffuse scattering values, and will be available through the special variables CrP, CgP and CbP.

Aktuna,

You need to change the modifier of each light, not the name as follows
(note that I'm using -m instead of -n):

#@rfluxmtx h=u
!xform -m L1_direkt -t 1.21 2.6 2.6  k_direkt.rad
#@rfluxmtx h=u
!xform -m L2_direkt -t 3 2.6 2.6  k_direkt.rad


And you need to define all these new modifiers in k_direkt.rad:

void brightdata k_direkt_dist
5 flatcorr k_direkt.dat source.cal src_phi4 src_theta
0
1 22.7273

k_direkt_dist light L1_direkt
0
0
3 1 1 1

k_direkt_dist light L2_direkt
0
0
3 1 1 1


And you need to delete the top polygon of your light fixture, you can't do
hemispherical sampling for two polygons that have opposite surface normals.

Then finally here is the proper command syntax:
rfluxmtx -V+ -I+ @szene.opt - lights.rad < messpunkte.xyz szene.rad >
koeffizientenmatrix.mtx


If the top polygon is important (ie it contributes significant light) then
you can either calculate separate contributions from up vs. down, or you
can use rcontrib:
rcontrib -V+ -I+ @szene.opt -m L1_direkt -m L2_direkt -m L3_direkt -m
L4_direkt -m L5_direkt -m L6_direkt szene.oct <messpunkte.xyz >
koeffizientenmatrix.mtx

Best,
Andy

Hi Aaron,

Peter has a database of measured materials with fitted radiance models:
http://www.pab.eu/gonio-photometer/demodata/bme/
I don't see stainless steel or zinc in that database.

I think probably the best thing to do, especially when you're trying to
distinguish between surface finishes, is to send your samples to a lab for
measurement.

Hi all,

I just started using Radiance and it seems to me difficult so I need your advices please.


1.       As Radiance Desktop is no more recommended for CFS daylighting, what is the alternative if one wants to study illuminance distribution (points values) inside an office that has CFS (with both diffuse and specular materials)?

2.       Is there any user-friendly-interface program that can do the task without the need to work with command-line procedure (that I am not good with at all)?

3.       If it's compulsory to use command-line tools, how can we construct/import CAD geometry and assign its materials?

4.       And, is there a step-by-step tutorials on how to run Radiance (in case of command-line)?

Your help/advice is really so appreciated.

Many thanks in Advance :)

Hi Andy,

that helped a lot, thanks!
I get results now, a rgb triple for each luminaire.
(koeffizientenmatrix_rgb.mtx)

I tried to use the -c 0 option to sum up the rgb values of rtcontrib but 0 seems to be unsupported
So I use rcalc and sum up the values afterwards.

Since we used "-I+" I don't have to multiply them with "$1=179*($1*.265+$2*.67+$3*.065)" but just add them together, right?
If I just add them, I got a tenth of the value it should be. (koeffizientenmatrix_lux2.mtx)
If I use the conversion formula, it's much higher as it should be. (koeffizientenmatrix_lux.mtx)

Do you have an hint for me?

Best ragards and thanks,
Berat

Hello Radiance community,

Since a few days I am trying around with rfluxmtx but got stuck in an error message: "missing receiver surface!"

I'm using radiance on windows with no gui.
I made a batch file to call:
oconv szene.rad lights.rad > szene.oct
rfluxmtx -I+ szene.oct @szene.opt - lights.rad < messpunkte.xyz > koeffizientenmatrix.mtx


in szene.rad I used #@rfluxmtx h=u before some polygons where the measurement points (messpunkte.xyz) are.

Szene.opt is: -I+ -h -dp 512 -ar 128 -ds .15 -dj .7 -dt .05 -dc .5 -dr 3 -ss .7 -st .1 -ab 0 -aa .1 -ad 512 -as 256 -lr 10 -lw .002 -av 0 0 0

Lights.rad positions the luminaires with xform and calls #@rfluxmtx h=u before each.
#@rfluxmtx h=u
!xform -n L1_direkt        -t 1.21 2.6 2.6                    k_direkt.rad
#@rfluxmtx h=u
!xform -n L2_direkt        -t 3 2.6 2.6                          k_direkt.rad
...

I also tried to write #@rfluxmtx h=u inside the k_direkt.rad luminaire file, no difference.

Feels like I tried every combination I can imagine for the luminaires and polygons but it just won't work.
I have attached the files.

Does anyone have an idea or has a working example I could learn from?

Thanks,
Berat

Hi Ikrima,

Tutorial series from Dr.Axel Jacobs will be quite helpful to you:

For 3D modeling you can use tools such as: Ecotect, SketchUp (with Daysim,
OpenStudio).

Hope this helps.

You need to use the formula (179*....).

If your values are 10 times higher than you expect, you should look at your
ies2rad conversion process to make sure that units are consistent and that
any multipliers you use make sense.

Best,
Andy

Subject: [Radiance-general] Rendering using Radiance_As Beginners - SPOT
 Pro released
Message-ID: <CAAP856zvGniQ_jtBztN7O5jOy12bvp5O+_Fy67zvjRp2cb=RgA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Ikrima,

One Windows-based user interface that might fit your needs is the Sensor
Placement + Optimization Tool (SPOT)
<http://www.daylightinginnovations.com/spot-home>

daylighting software.  A new version, SPOT Pro, was just released and is
now available for download at the above website.

SPOT Pro provides an interface to Radiance and has the capability to
perform annual daylighting simulation using BSDF files to describe Complex
Fenestration Systems (CFS) and allowing you to schedule automated and/or
manual control of the window treatments.  The SPOT interface allows you to
build simpler orthogonal geometry, assign materials and render or simulate
throughout the year.  Importing from sketchup can be done behind the scenes
and will be available soon.  SPOT also allows for further analysis and
optimization and photosensor systems in your daylit space if desired.
Calculation of vertical illuminance grids, or other directional illuminance
points, if needed, are not built into the program but can certainly be
calculated behind the scenes of a SPOT model without too much command line
interface.

The software is in a final Beta testing stage where we are testing
downloads, installation and operation on different machine types, operating
systems, and MS Office versions.  If the trial version downloads, installs,
and starts up on your machine - chances are you are good to go.  If not,
please report issues to spot at daylightinginnovations.com.

Good timing for your questions - SPOT Pro was just posted and I was just
about to send out such an announcement to the list.

Regards,
Zack

  Hi Greg,

I tried following your indications and it worked, although, I had to remove
Nkbins because it is undefined variable. I do not way but it could be not

I removed and thus, the default number is 0:

However, generated window_000.hdr file does not have light. It is a black

Do you know why does it happen?

Thank you!

What do you use to view the HDR image? Try typing:
ximage -e auto window_000.hdr

This will automatically adjust the exposure of your image upon initially opening the file. It could be that your image does have non-zero values but the exposure is skewed in your viewpoint making it look black with the default exposure value.

Or type
ximage window_000.hdr
then hit the ?a? key while ximage is active to view it with automatic exposure
while ximage is active you can also hit the ?=? key and click a point in the image to adjust the exposure according to various points in the image

	created with genBSDF
Message-ID: <CALzUQjp-Ls+QN6Y0wbbPUbVULyc+jTVPW7Rdr5Gz8sFrrCYiAw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Everyone,

I have already created a BSDF project which contains a Venetian blind with
a genBSDF,in which I enter the geometry, the material and the glazing. To
do this I have used the next command (in addition,I attached the respective
files)
https://www.dropbox.com/s/c8vrn445gz2nmd8/glazing.rad?dl=0
https://www.dropbox.com/s/7foi5rqb5a4ll78/Layer0.rad?dl=0
https://www.dropbox.com/s/o8rz1bw28la0s8g/materials.mat?dl=0

genBSDF -n 8 materials.mat glazing.rad Layer0.rad > Case1.xml
https://www.dropbox.com/s/objuhir1asplcog/Case1.xml?dl=0

Apparently,It worked right since I can see it in  BSDF Viewer.

However , the problem happen when I connect this BSDF with the window which
contains WINDOW 7.3 software.So, when I try to add a shading since XML
file, the program shut down.

I have looked over each step but I dont know where can be the mistake.Do
you have any idea about this problem or what is happening?

Thanks you in advance,

King regards,

Daniel

  Hello Christopher,

Thank you for your response.
I think that in the radiance-4.2.2-win32.exe there is not the ximage
program. I usually use RadianceIV.exe program from Ecotect.

C:\Radiance\test\20150505\vmx>ximage window_000.hdr
"ximage" no se reconoce como un comando interno o externo,
programa o archivo por lotes ejecutable.

  However, I find klems_full.cal file that it has all information about
kbinS and Nkbins.
Now I have 145 .hdr files. They have light source, but the room walls are
black (is it usual?)

In reference to /pcompos,/ window1_*.hdr is invalid argument. Do you know
why?
  C:\Radiance\test\20150505\vmx\images>pcompos -a 10 -b 1 1 1
"window1_*.hdr" > al
  lwindow1.hdr
  window1_*.hdr: Invalid argument

Thank you in advance,
Kind regards,
Urtza.

Hi Zack,

Many thanks for your advices.

Regarding SPOT Pro, it seems that it can work out annual simulation for CFS with BSDF but for grid points we still need to use command-line (as you clarified). Also, we still need to use command-line (radiance) to generate BSDF that will be used with SPOT Pro . Is that right?

Also, what is the difference between SPOT Pro and Daysim tools in terms of accuracy and flexibility (as both using Radiance engine)?

Regards
Ikrima

Hi Ikrima,

One Windows-based user interface that might fit your needs is the Sensor Placement + Optimization Tool (SPOT) <http://www.daylightinginnovations.com/spot-home>

daylighting software.  A new version, SPOT Pro, was just released and is now available for download at the above website.

SPOT Pro provides an interface to Radiance and has the capability to perform annual daylighting simulation using BSDF files to describe Complex Fenestration Systems (CFS) and allowing you to schedule automated and/or manual control of the window treatments.  The SPOT interface allows you to build simpler orthogonal geometry, assign materials and render or simulate throughout the year.  Importing from sketchup can be done behind the scenes and will be available soon.  SPOT also allows for further analysis and optimization and photosensor systems in your daylit space if desired.
Calculation of vertical illuminance grids, or other directional illuminance points, if needed, are not built into the program but can certainly be calculated behind the scenes of a SPOT model without too much command line interface.

The software is in a final Beta testing stage where we are testing downloads, installation and operation on different machine types, operating systems, and MS Office versions.  If the trial version downloads, installs, and starts up on your machine - chances are you are good to go.  If not, please report issues to spot at daylightinginnovations.com.

Good timing for your questions - SPOT Pro was just posted and I was just about to send out such an announcement to the list.

Regards,
Zack

Do you know why does it happen?

What do you use to view the HDR image? Try typing:
ximage -e auto window_000.hdr

This will automatically adjust the exposure of your image upon initially opening the file. It could be that your image does have non-zero values but the exposure is skewed in your viewpoint making it look black with the default exposure value.

Or type
ximage window_000.hdr
then hit the ?a? key while ximage is active to view it with automatic exposure
while ximage is active you can also hit the ?=? key and click a point in the image to adjust the exposure according to various points in the image

Hi Ikrima,

Answers below:

SPOT does automatically calculate a workplane level (height can be
specified) grid of points.  In you query it sounded like maybe you were
interested in possible other illuminance points (eye level or wall) for
which you may need to go behind the scenes and work with classic Radiance.

>
BSDF files can come from several places:  1) there is a small library of
generic ones in SPOT.  2) You can generate them via genBSDF and command
lines. 3) LBL's Window 7.3 program can generate them 4) If small enough
samples you can have physical goniophotometer measurements that would need
to be converted to the Radiance BSDF format 5) use companies like mine, we
offer daylighting performance characterization and BSDF creation for
complex optical daylight systems as service.

Also, what is the difference between SPOT Pro and Daysim tools in terms of

They both use Radiance for all simulation they just have two different
approaches to annual simulation.  DAYSIM uses Daylight Coefficients,
breaking the sky into atleast 145 patches and calculating the contribution
from each and then using this data to simulate throughout the year. 1, 2, 3
and 5phase methods all just treat the sun and sky components in different
ways.  SPOT interpolates from a range of design day calculations to
simulate throughout the year.  In my opinion both have some advantages and
disadvantages in terms of accuracy and speed and how they can treat window
treatments.  The annual comparison's I have seen show very similar results
between the two methods but I do feel more annual daylighting simulation
studies and validation is needed of all methods in general.

Hi Urtza,

You should not be using the file "klems_ang.cal" but something like "klems_full.cal" or klems_int.cal.  This is why Nkbins was undefined, and probably at least one reason your simulation is not working.

Best,
-Greg

Daniel,

I'm surprised that WINDOW would crash like that. But one problem is that to
import a BSDF into WINDOW it must have both front and back transmission and
reflection. To get this you should use both the +f  and +b options in
genBSDF.

Best,
Andy

Hi Zhe,

It looks like apple removed some GL support in the version of OS X you are using, which is too bad.  You will need to edit src/util/Rmakefile and remove the program "glrad" from the PROGS= setting near the top.  Then, rerun "rmake install" in that directory.

You didn't include all of your compile listing, so it's difficult to know why rpict is not found, but did you remember to do as it suggested at the end and add "/Applications/radiance/ray/bin" to your PATH variable?  I don't know why you decided to put everything there rather than /usr/local, but in any case, the shell won't find commands unless it knows where to look for them.

Cheers,
-Greg

Zhe,

The one error that is visible in your screenshot isn't what cause rpict to
fail to compile. There are probably more errors above in the terminal
window if you scroll up. Can you copy all the text from when you started to
compile alll the way to the end into an email? Just use copy paste rather
than attaching screenshot images.

Thanks,
Andy

Hi Zack,

Many thanks for your clarifying. 
I have a more general question just now raised (as a beginner in this field). I wish if you can help me to answer:

As Daysim and SPOT Pro's main difference is mainly how to treat with sun and sky components, is that applies to all radiance-based-engine tools (including Radiance command-line approach itself)? By other words, is the way sun-and-sky-being-treated the main motivation to go for radiance-based-engine-tools rather than simple tools (i.e. like Ecotect)? So if someone needs to just investigate how different complex fenestration systems will affect indoor daylight coefficients (no illuminance levels nor pictures needed), there is no need to generate BSDF data for those CFS and even no need to use radiance?

Does that sound right?

Sorry for my long emails, but really this will help me a lot at my early stages.

Best regards
Ikrima

Hi Ikrima,

Answers below:

Regarding SPOT Pro, it seems that it can work out annual simulation for CFS

> you clarified).

SPOT does automatically calculate a workplane level (height can be
specified) grid of points.  In you query it sounded like maybe you were interested in possible other illuminance points (eye level or wall) for which you may need to go behind the scenes and work with classic Radiance.


> Also, we still need to use command-line (radiance) to generate BSDF

>
BSDF files can come from several places:  1) there is a small library of generic ones in SPOT.  2) You can generate them via genBSDF and command lines. 3) LBL's Window 7.3 program can generate them 4) If small enough samples you can have physical goniophotometer measurements that would need to be converted to the Radiance BSDF format 5) use companies like mine, we offer daylighting performance characterization and BSDF creation for complex optical daylight systems as service.

Also, what is the difference between SPOT Pro and Daysim tools in terms of

>
They both use Radiance for all simulation they just have two different approaches to annual simulation.  DAYSIM uses Daylight Coefficients, breaking the sky into atleast 145 patches and calculating the contribution from each and then using this data to simulate throughout the year. 1, 2, 3 and 5phase methods all just treat the sun and sky components in different ways.  SPOT interpolates from a range of design day calculations to simulate throughout the year.  In my opinion both have some advantages and disadvantages in terms of accuracy and speed and how they can treat window treatments.  The annual comparison's I have seen show very similar results between the two methods but I do feel more annual daylighting simulation studies and validation is needed of all methods in general.

Hi Urtza,

You should not be using the file "klems_ang.cal" but something like "klems_full.cal" or klems_int.cal.  This is why Nkbins was undefined, and probably at least one reason your simulation is not working.

Best,
-Greg

Hi

Did you  install the X11?

I have build Radiance and used on Yosemite.

The Daylight Coefficient or a Design Day interpolation annual simulation
approaches do not have to be unique to Ray-tracing engines, like Radiance.
Radiosity engines can make use of the same concepts for annual simulation.
Radiosity can often run a single point in time quicker, with other
limitations, and so can calculate more coefficients or design days.  I am
not sure, but I believe Ecotect is providing an interface to Radiance for
simulation and maybe has its own sun path and solar shading design tools.

I believe good representative BSDF data, or just a good model of the
fenestration system itself, would still be very important to get a good
calculation of daylight coefficients (which is as challenging of a
calculation as illuminance).  Using Radiance based tools is not necessary
as there are other Ray-tracing and Radiosity based tools that can do
similar calculations.  One convenient thing is that the Radiance based
tools use this standard XML BSDF definition now which aligns with the
Windows 7 software giving greater access to these definitions.

Regards,
Zack

  Hello Christopher,

Thank you for your response.
I think that in the radiance-4.2.2-win32.exe there is not the ximage
program. I usually use RadianceIV.exe program from Ecotect.

C:\Radiance\test\20150505\vmx>ximage window_000.hdr
"ximage" no se reconoce como un comando interno o externo,
programa o archivo por lotes ejecutable.

  However, I find klems_full.cal file that it has all information about
kbinS and Nkbins.
Now I have 145 .hdr files. They have light source, but the room walls are
black (is it usual?)

In reference to /pcompos,/ window1_*.hdr is invalid argument. Do you know
why?
  C:\Radiance\test\20150505\vmx\images>pcompos -a 10 -b 1 1 1

Thank you in advance,
Kind regards,

Hi All,

I have installed radiance from (radiance-4.2-win32.exe<https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/download/4.2/radiance-4.2-win32.exe>); Do I still need to compile radiance from source code after that? Or, it's now ready to be used?

Hi Ikrima,

If you used that installer, and you let it modify your path for you, then you are ready to run. You can test this by going to a command prompt and typing:

rtrace.exe -version

You should see the Radiance version printed. If you get a "rtrace.exe is not recognized..." error, then your paths are likely not set up correctly.

Having said that, I recommend you try out the latest v5.0 release of Radiance. There are some important bug fixes and new features, including 64-bit Windows binaries. We posted new installers just the other day, here:

https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/tag/5.0.a.3

Hi Rob,

Thanks for your answer.

Yes, it does, and versions printed successfully. 
Now, I am trying to investigate how to run radiance using tutorials, which are based on Unix. Can I do them using the radiance (have just installed for Win32) or shall I install the one for Linux?

Regards
Ikrima

Hi Ikrima,

Not really knowing your exact needs, I'll try to answer:

> tools (including Radiance command-line approach itself)? By other

The Daylight Coefficient or a Design Day interpolation annual simulation approaches do not have to be unique to Ray-tracing engines, like Radiance.
Radiosity engines can make use of the same concepts for annual simulation.
Radiosity can often run a single point in time quicker, with other limitations, and so can calculate more coefficients or design days.  I am not sure, but I believe Ecotect is providing an interface to Radiance for simulation and maybe has its own sun path and solar shading design tools.


> So if someone needs to just investigate how different complex

I believe good representative BSDF data, or just a good model of the fenestration system itself, would still be very important to get a good calculation of daylight coefficients (which is as challenging of a calculation as illuminance).  Using Radiance based tools is not necessary as there are other Ray-tracing and Radiosity based tools that can do similar calculations.  One convenient thing is that the Radiance based tools use this standard XML BSDF definition now which aligns with the Windows 7 software giving greater access to these definitions.

Regards,
Zack

  Hello Christopher,

Thank you for your response.
I think that in the radiance-4.2.2-win32.exe there is not the ximage
program. I usually use RadianceIV.exe program from Ecotect.

C:\Radiance\test\20150505\vmx>ximage window_000.hdr
"ximage" no se reconoce como un comando interno o externo,
programa o archivo por lotes ejecutable.

  However, I find klems_full.cal file that it has all information about
kbinS and Nkbins.
Now I have 145 .hdr files. They have light source, but the room walls are
black (is it usual?)

In reference to /pcompos,/ window1_*.hdr is invalid argument. Do you know
why?
  C:\Radiance\test\20150505\vmx\images>pcompos -a 10 -b 1 1 1
"window1_*.hdr" > al
  lwindow1.hdr
  window1_*.hdr: Invalid argument

Thank you in advance,
Kind regards,
Urtza.

Yes, that was the whole point of getting Windows binaries together, was so
people could use Radiance on their Windows computers. At this point, just
about everything in Radiance works on Windows, including all the "core"
programs needed for lighting analysis, renderings, daylight coefficients,
etc. This is, as they say, awesome.

Unfortunately Windows does have some differences (and straight-up
limitations), and so the command syntax will differ slightly in some cases
as you work through the tutorials. For example, Windows doesn't support
multithreading the way it's implemented in the Radiance tools. So the "-n
(n)" options to rtrace, rpict, and rcontrib don't work. Also back ticks
are not recognized as a way of passing output from a command to another
one. Greg just posted a Windows workaround for that one the other day, on
this list. I suggest trying the tutorial and see how it goes, and search
the radiance-general archives or post here if you get stuck.

By way of a shameless plug, I should tell you that OpenStudio also uses
Radiance for daylighting simulations, and these many workarounds for
getting Radiance to work on Windows are scattered throughout the source
code?

I'm probably not the one to answer this, as I don't use Windows and haven't seen this error, but did you check to make sure there are files that match "window1_*.hdr" in the directory where pcompos is executed?

Welp, it appears that the '*' wildcard expansion does not work with Windows in the standard shell, even though the wildcard does work with other internal commands, such as 'type' (Windows-speak for 'cat'). As they say: WTF?

- Rob

P.S. The wildcard does expand correctly with pcompos in a Cygwin shell, so there's that.

P.P.S. You can install a lightweight Cygwin shell by simply installing Git for Windows (https://msysgit.github.io/). You get a proper BASH shell in Windows with minimal effort. Highly recommended.

Hi Greg,

Thanks!
Now, I will try to solve the problem with pcompos (window1_*.hdr, invalid argument)

C:\Radiance\test\20150505\vmx\images>pcompos -a 10 -b 1 1 1 window1_*.hdr > al
lwindow1.hdr
window1_*.hdr: Invalid argument

Best wishes!

Hi Urtza,

You should not be using the file "klems_ang.cal" but something like "klems_full.cal" or klems_int.cal.  This is why Nkbins was undefined, and probably at least one reason your simulation is not working.

Best,
-Greg

Hello Christopher,

Thank you for your response.
I think that in the radiance-4.2.2-win32.exe there is not the ximage program. I usually use RadianceIV.exe program from Ecotect.

C:\Radiance\test\20150505\vmx>ximage window_000.hdr
"ximage" no se reconoce como un comando interno o externo,
programa o archivo por lotes ejecutable.

However, I find klems_full.cal file that it has all information about kbinS and Nkbins.
Now I have 145 .hdr files. They have light source, but the room walls are black (is it usual?)

In reference to pcompos, window1_*.hdr is invalid argument. Do you know why?

C:\Radiance\test\20150505\vmx\images>pcompos -a 10 -b 1 1 1 "window1_*.hdr" > al
lwindow1.hdr
window1_*.hdr: Invalid argument

Thank you in advance,
Kind regards,
Urtza.

What do you use to view the HDR image? Try typing:
ximage -e auto window_000.hdr
This will automatically adjust the exposure of your image upon initially opening the file. It could be that your image does have non-zero values but the exposure is skewed in your viewpoint making it look black with the default exposure value.
Or type
ximage window_000.hdr
then hit the 'a' key while ximage is active to view it with automatic exposure
while ximage is active you can also hit the '=' key and click a point in the image to adjust the exposure according to various points in the image

The "cmd" shell does not do filename expansion; commands that support it
do it themselves--"cmd" is quite minimal. To make that pcompos command
work, it would have to be provided with the full list of files, spelled
out. This could be done in Windows PowerShell or perhaps via some
combination of command. Anyone who knows Windows scripting well willing
to provide an alternative?

Rob,
Getting off-topic, but not sure if it warrants a separate thread... you imply that we can run Radiance commands in the Git for Windows bash shell. Is there an advantage to doing so, in comparison to Cygwin (which I have used in the past)? Both would have the clear advantages of being able to use more powerful scripted commands when compared to the Windows cmd prompt, but Git-bash is more lightweight while Cygwin would be more powerful (for things unrelated to Radiance?)? In both cases install according to normal Windows Radiance installation and adjust paths as necessary in each environment?

-Chris

Hi Chris,

The main advantages I see in using Git's Bash shell for Windows are
smaller footprint, easier installation, and tighter integration. I haven't
done extensive testing, but it seems like the Git Bash shell gives Windows
users a more similar and compatible experience to that of the Unix user,
potentially allowing folks to use things like Andy McNeil's tutorials,
as-written. 

The installer is 17MB and just *works*, adding a shortcut to a "Git Bash"
command prompt. Once fired up, you have access to your existing file
system, and all the basic CLI tools a Unix user us used to (e.g. ls) are
there and just work, along with things like wildcards. =) There's no other
system tuning to do. I haven't used or set up Cygwin in a long time but
this Git shell is a lot easier than the Cygwin I've used. I still haven't
tested any of the more esoteric Radiance command pipelines (such as what's
used to get view parameters passed to rcontrib), but ASSuming they work,
coupled with a Windows Python or Ruby interpreter I'd bet you can get
pretty close to the Unix experience on Windows with little brain damage
now. 

Having said all that, there are still things that the Windows user gives
up in RadianceLand. The built-in multithreading (in rcontrib, rtrace,
rpict, et al.) doesn't work; there are a few remaining Radiance commands
that are written in csh so those (probably (might?)) won't work; native
manpage support is lacking; and Roland had to use some sub-optimal
functions to get all the photon map stuff to build on Windows. Still, I
think we've come a long way?

- Rob

Hi everybody,

Thanks for your suggestions. I have a doubt for a month when I have started
using Radiance. Is Linux advisable to use for Radiance? Perhaps, it may in
the long run be better.

Kind regards!

If you can get ahold of a Unix-based system, be it a Mac running OSX or a Linux system, your experience will likely be better, yes. But I do think that with the latest installer we provide here (https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/tag/5.0.a.3) and the "Git Bash shell" from here (https://msysgit.github.io/), you could get pretty darn close to the same experience as you would on *nix.

Good luck!

powerful (for things unrelated to Radiance?)? In both cases install
according to normal Windows Radiance installation and adjust paths as
necessary in each environment?

Welp, it appears that the '*' wildcard expansion does not work with
Windows in the standard shell, even though the wildcard does work with
other internal commands, such as 'type' (Windows-speak for 'cat'). As
they say: WTF?

- Rob

P.S. The wildcard does expand correctly with pcompos in a Cygwin shell,
so there's that.

P.P.S. You can install a lightweight Cygwin shell by simply installing
Git for Windows (https://msysgit.github.io/). You get a proper BASH shell
in Windows with minimal effort. Highly recommended.

Subject: [Radiance-general] set PATH and RAYPATH in the batch file - WINDOWS
	8.1
Message-ID: <CAOn=hKFf4o7PRe2Bfw0MRF0xOu+ee=e+T7Bzwp0uvOzvRZcbxA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear experts,



I have already set in the environment variables of *WINDOW 8.1* the path
and raypath for Radiance. However, I would like also to set PATH and
RAYPATH straight in a batch file for a question of Radiance version
required by our tool.



Below what I have written in the *.bat file:



*set RAYPATH=.;C:\Radiance\lib;$RAYPATH*

*set PATH=.;C:\Radiance\bin\;$PATH*

*c:*

*cd /d %~dp0*

*gendaylit 1 3 9 -L 0 2500 -a 44.4167 -o -8.85 -m 15 -i 60 | genskyvec.pl
<http://genskyvec.pl> -m 4 -c 1 1 1 > temp/skysun.skv*



and this is the error that I got:



print() on closed filehandle OCONV at C:\Radiance\bin\genskyvec.pl line
114, <>line 18.

print() on closed filehandle OCONV at C:\Radiance\bin\genskyvec.pl line
115, <>line 18.

print() on closed filehandle OCONV at C:\Radiance\bin\genskyvec.pl line
116, <>line 18.

Use of uninitialized value in split at C:\Radiance\bin\genskyvec.pl line
137, <> line 18.

Use of uninitialized value $ang[0] in addition (+) at C:\Radiance\bin\
genskyvec.pl line 138, <> line 18.

Use of uninitialized value in split at C:\Radiance\bin\genskyvec.pl line
137, <> line 18.

Use of uninitialized value $ang[1] in addition (+) at C:\Radiance\bin\
genskyvec.pl line 138, <> line 18.

Use of uninitialized value in split at C:\Radiance\bin\genskyvec.pl line
137, <> line 18.

Use of uninitialized value $ang[2] in addition (+) at C:\Radiance\bin\
genskyvec.pl line 138, <> line 18.

Use of uninitialized value $ang[0] in addition (+) at C:\Radiance\bin\
genskyvec.pl line 141, <> line 18.

Use of uninitialized value $dom[0] in division (/) at C:\Radiance\bin\
genskyvec.pl line 141, <> line 18.

Illegal division by zero at C:\Radiance\bin\genskyvec.pl line 141, <> line
18.



Of course, if I run the batch file only with:



*cd /d %~dp0*

*gendaylit 1 3 9 -L 0 2500 -a 44.4167 -o -8.85 -m 15 -i 60 | genskyvec.pl
<http://genskyvec.pl> -m 4 -c 1 1 1 > temp/skysun.skv*


all works fine.


I have also noticed that Radiance's commands that do not require the perl
intrepreter run without problems with the path and raypath set in the batch
file.


Any advice?




Cheers,
*Giuseppe De Michele*

Hi Giuseppe,

you can just drop the Perl exe files from
http://www.jaloxa.eu/resources/radiance/radwinexe.shtml
into Radiance's bin folder.  They don't require a Perl interpreter to
be installed.

Don't have Window 8.1 but from memory in unix bash environmental 
variables are referred to as $var
in Windows batch files use %var%

Hope this helps.

Dear Axel and Terrance,

thanks for the prompt answer. Now I have all clear. Using the %PATH% after
my path I solved my problem.

Axel, yours solution gave me the same problem, just because the problem
wasn?t the perl interpreter but the request of other ?files system?
(probably needed by perl) in the PATH.


Best,

Giuseppe

Dear Experts,
I've downloaded from:

http://www.jaloxa.eu/resources/radiance/radwinexe.shtml

the Windows compiled radiance files provided by Axel Jacobs. Thank you for
your work.

All the *.exe files provided seem to work properly, except for genBSDF.exe
that close immediately after start, because Windows 8.1 experienced some
problems.

On the other hand the LBNL WINDOW 7.3 genBSDF.exe file works without any
problem.

Did someone experienced the same problem in Windows 8.1? Am I missing
something?

Thank you in advance

Best Regards

Hi Urtza,

Linux is preferable above windows for using Radiance. We have very good experiences with our students using a virtual linux machine under windows 7.
We are using the "Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager" with Ubuntu. For our students we have prepared an Image (Appliance) with all necessary programs in it for running Radiance, Evalglare and some handy scripts.

Kind regards,
Jan

Hi everybody,

Thanks for your suggestions. I have a doubt for a month when I have started
using Radiance. Is Linux advisable to use for Radiance? Perhaps, it may in
the long run be better.

Kind regards!
Urtza.

If you can get ahold of a Unix-based system, be it a Mac running OSX or a Linux system, your experience will likely be better, yes. But I do think that with the latest installer we provide here (https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/tag/5.0.a.3) and the "Git Bash shell" from here (https://msysgit.github.io/), you could get pretty darn close to the same experience as you would on *nix.

Good luck!

Hi Chris,

The main advantages I see in using Git's Bash shell for Windows are
smaller footprint, easier installation, and tighter integration. I haven't
done extensive testing, but it seems like the Git Bash shell gives Windows
users a more similar and compatible experience to that of the Unix user,
potentially allowing folks to use things like Andy McNeil's tutorials,
as-written.

The installer is 17MB and just *works*, adding a shortcut to a "Git Bash"
command prompt. Once fired up, you have access to your existing file
system, and all the basic CLI tools a Unix user us used to (e.g. ls) are
there and just work, along with things like wildcards. =) There's no other
system tuning to do. I haven't used or set up Cygwin in a long time but
this Git shell is a lot easier than the Cygwin I've used. I still haven't
tested any of the more esoteric Radiance command pipelines (such as what's
used to get view parameters passed to rcontrib), but ASSuming they work,
coupled with a Windows Python or Ruby interpreter I'd bet you can get
pretty close to the Unix experience on Windows with little brain damage
now.

Having said all that, there are still things that the Windows user gives
up in RadianceLand. The built-in multithreading (in rcontrib, rtrace,
rpict, et al.) doesn't work; there are a few remaining Radiance commands
that are written in csh so those (probably (might?)) won't work; native
manpage support is lacking; and Roland had to use some sub-optimal
functions to get all the photon map stuff to build on Windows. Still, I
think we've come a long way?

Welp, it appears that the '*' wildcard expansion does not work with
Windows in the standard shell, even though the wildcard does work with
other internal commands, such as 'type' (Windows-speak for 'cat'). As
they say: WTF?

- Rob

P.S. The wildcard does expand correctly with pcompos in a Cygwin shell,
so there's that.

P.P.S. You can install a lightweight Cygwin shell by simply installing
Git for Windows (https://msysgit.github.io/). You get a proper BASH shell
in Windows with minimal effort. Highly recommended.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Hard-coding .cal and data files
Message-ID: <001601d09316$17948f80$46bdae80$@psu.edu>

Hi,

 

 

Is it possible to hard-code a data or .cal file inside a rad definition ? 

 

I am generating a few luminaire definitions using a batch file and was
wondering if it is possible to avoid linking rad files to external files.
For example, in the luminaire definition below, is it possible to code the
.dat and .cal file inside the rad file ?

 

void brightdata 2RT8S_2_32_LP735_dist

5 flatcorr C:/rm/ies/2RT8S_2_32_LP735.dat source.cal src_phi4 src_theta 

0

1 1.54935

 

 

 

Thanks,

Sarith

Hi Sarith,

There is no way to incorporate the luminaire data directly in the Radiance file other than some kind of reference.  What is your concern, exactly?  If you don't want to have the full path name, you can store the data files in the same file as source.cal and take off the leading directory, or add a new directory to your $RAYPATH (or %RAYPATH%) environment variable and put the data files there.

Having many sources refer to a common data file is one way Radiance saves memory when you have many light sources sharing the same distribution.

Best,
-Greg

Hi Greg,

 

 

Thanks. I asked this question because I am interested in simplifying the
organization of files in a project. 

 

I have run into issues in the past with projects that have multiple
luminaire definitions. The image below is a screenshot from the directory
containing rad files for one such project. Add or removing luminaires, or
even sky definitions with .cal files, in a scene will be easier if I could
add or  replace rad files alone without worrying about the linking data
files. 

 

 



 

 

Thanks,

Sarith

Hi,

 

 

Is it possible to hard-code a data or .cal file inside a rad definition ? 

 

I am generating a few luminaire definitions using a batch file and was
wondering if it is possible to avoid linking rad files to external files.
For example, in the luminaire definition below, is it possible to code the
.dat and .cal file inside the rad file ?

 

void brightdata 2RT8S_2_32_LP735_dist

5 flatcorr C:/rm/ies/2RT8S_2_32_LP735.dat source.cal src_phi4 src_theta 

0

1 1.54935

 

 

Thanks,

Sarith

Well, if you make sure your luminaire (*.rad) and data (*.dat) files are uniquely named, you can just store everything together in a separate directory and put it in your RAYPATH environment variable as I suggested.  Since the xform command will look in your RAYPATH directories and so will Radiance, you don't need to have them in your current directory at all.  Everything can live somewhere else.  You can even use the "-l" option of ies2rad to put files there for you.

Cheers,
-Greg

Hi Urtza,

I think you are right to suspect that you need to change the -m option parameter sky_glow to sky_mat with the change in your file.  Otherwise, I think your results in "south.dmx" might be missing.  What is the size of this file, and does it contain any data?

It's also untrustworthy to use binary file times under Windows.  I would remove the "-faf" option to rcontrib for that reason.

Cheers,
-Greg

Oh yeah, floats are a no go with Windows, at least with this stuff. Definitely use "-faa" instead of "-faf" when specifying the format...

I am trying to get annual illuminance data. However, I am having problems

The file has 213 MB. Do anyone know what is the problem?

The tutorial is slightly out-of-date with respect to the latest tools.  You no longer need the "-n 8760" option to dctimestep, as it gets this information from the sky matrix header.  Try again without that option.

Best,

Hi,

I am making hdr and want to have luminace fotos as well. I dont have a MAC,
and using the one of somebody else. Is there another program or way to
install atmosphere on a windows? I saw some stuff on the internet of
running mac on a windows but wanted to know if there is a solution that is
easier!

Hi Jasper,

If you just want to create HDR images from exposure-bracketed 
photographs, why not try out WebHDR:

http://www.jaloxa.eu/webhdr

It relies on Greg's hdrgen, which is essentially the engine behind 
Photosphere.

The only downside is that I had to limit the resolution of the HDR image 
so as to not run out of storage space on my server.

Hope this help

Cheers

Axel

I have to use Evalglare as well, but that is on the windows. Want to cut
out the parts where the MAC is needed, Photospere.. Resolution for
Evalglare is maxium 800px width and height so thats not the problem.

Dear experts, I was wondering whether the chk files generated by radiance to color the glare patches respond to a quantitative logic or they are just random colors assigned. Thanks in advance, Alejandro

Hi Alejandro,

The colors are randomly assigned.

Dear experts,
I was wondering whether the chk files generated by radiance to color the glare patches respond to a quantitative logic or they are just random colors assigned.
Thanks in advance,

Penn State University is pleased to host the 14th Annual International Radiance Workshop from Monday, August 17th to Wednesday, August 19th 2015 at the headquarters of the Consortium for Building Energy Innovation (CBEI), located in the Philadelphia Navy Yard.  The Navy Yard is a vibrant and growing urban business campus located approximately 7 miles south of downtown Philadelphia, 6 miles east of the Philadelphia airport, and 4 miles south of the 30th St. Railway Station (AMTRAK).  The site address is 4960 South 12th St, Philadelphia, PA  19112.
Online workshop registration will open shortly and a block of rooms is currently reserved at the Marriott Courtyard South at a rate of $184 plus tax (Phone: 215-644-9400)  This hotel is on the Navy Yard site and within walking distance of the workshop.  Parking is free.  Please refer to the "International Radiance Workshop - Penn State" when registering.  Additional hotels are available in downtown Philadelphia, from which you can ride a free shuttle to the Navy Yard (see Center City Express shuttle at http://navyyard.org/information-and-directions/the-navy-yard-shuttle). More hotels are located adjacent to the airport (taxi or rental car required for transportation to the Navy Yard).
Attendees are invited to share examples of work they have performed using Radiance, or that is in progress, in a prepared 30-minute presentation.  Come to share your knowledge and/or learn about the latest Radiance features, developments, and opportunities to apply Radiance in your professional practice.  Connect with enthusiasts from around the world who apply Radiance in lighting design, daylighting, animation, simulation, and rendering activities.
If you are interested in presenting your work, which is highly encouraged, please send a short abstract (300 words or less) for consideration for inclusion on the conference program to 2015RadianceWS at gmail.com<mailto:2015RadianceWS at gmail.com> by June 12.  Separate proposals from a single presenter on more than one topic or project are acceptable. Presenters will receive a $50 discount on their registration fee.  Details on registration and fees will be available within the next week (expected registration fee of $250 or less).
Presentations will be made available after the workshop on www.radiance-online.org\workshops<http://www.radiance-online.org/workshops>. Presentations will also be livestreamed for individuals who cannot attend.
I look forward to your participation and/or attendance at this exciting event.

Hello experts,

I am trying to get Illuminance data by The Three-Phase Method of East 45?

? Can I put by hand -b kbin(Nx,Ny, Nz, Ux, Uy,Uz)? I try but it seems it

Hi Urtza,

You can definitely put in the normal manually, and 0.7 0.7 0.0 is correct for SE-facing window. What happened (or didn't happen)?

What I am going to try does not come from the error message (because I see
the modifier there)... try putting the *kbin()* between ""... that is

-b kbin(0.7,-0.7,0,0,0,1) --> -b 'kbin(0.7,-0.7,0,0,0,1)' -- or --> -b
"kbin(0.7,-0.7,0,0,0,1)"

Also, I see you are missing a comma there...

Bye!

The missing comma generated your error, but you'll get some other errors if you don't pass kbin a normalized vector.  Use:

	-b "kbin(sqrt(.5),-sqrt(.5),0,0,0,1)"

instead.

	Name
Message-ID: <AE55A995167B224DBBFA16500E3AB9B3047E03FC@NDJSMBX202.ndc.nasa.gov>

Hello Dear Radiance Community,

I'm curious if it is possible to identify a specific geometry primitive identifier name in a .rad file given an .hdr image of the octree that uses this geometry .rad file? I have a .rad geometry file that contains numerous polygons and it would be helpful to be able to identify a specific polygon identifier name by simply clicking on its surface within an .hdr image. This is useful for debugging purposes, where the geometry consists of a large number of geometry primitives.

If anybody has developed a Radiance utility that performs this task, I would greatly appreciate it you could share it or give some insight into the procedure.

Best Regards,
Andrei Kolomenski

  Hi,

"kbin(0.7,-0.7,0,0,0,1)" and?-b "kbin(sqrt(.5),-sqrt(.5),0,0,0,1)"?work.
Thanks!

On the other hand, I have other problem with file.xml because with other
VenetianBlind.xml file works:?
C:\Users\Urtza\Desktop\AIE50\CFS>dctimestep results/photocellsRotated45.vmx
data
/Lasercut_Panel_145x1297.xml results/south.dmx Geneva.smx >
results/illum_lp.dat
fatal - unexpected column count in header

  Does anyone know what happen?
Thank you a lot,
Urtza.

Greg has developed just such a tool. rvu has a command line option that
allows you to query the surface under the cursor. I don't have a Radiance
installation around but you should find it in the man page.

It was either that or a cunning pipe between the output of rvu (view
direction) and rtrace to report the modifier.

You could just use the "trace" command in rvu too; it will return the coordinates of the surface, and then the modifier. But I think Andrei wants specifically to query the output HDR, not the octree. (?)

If you have X11, you can pipe the output of ximage into rtrace and use the 't' key to retrace individual rays.  You need to give rtrace the scene octree and set its -o option to report the information you need, like "-oms" to report the intersected surface's modifier and name:

       ximage render.hdr | rtrace -h -oms scene.oct

I'm always amazed when Greg brings out these little gems that have always
existed, but nobody really knew about. I honestly don't think looked at the
man page for ximage before today.

Hello Rob & Thomas,

Thank you for the input, I wasn't aware rvu had the 'trace' functionality. I just used it to render an image and successfully identified my polygon of interest. This was sufficient for my purposes. I appreciate the help.

Kind Regards,
Andrei Kolomenski

If you have X11, you can pipe the output of ximage into rtrace and use the 't' key to retrace individual rays.  You need to give rtrace the scene octree and set its -o option to report the information you need, like "-oms" to report the intersected surface's modifier and name:

       ximage render.hdr | rtrace -h -oms scene.oct

Hi Urtza,

You make it challenging to help you when you provide so little information in your posts.  This forces folks to ask silly follow-up questions, like "Where did you get your XML file and what is in it?"  Judging by the filename, it looks like it uses a non-standard (and non-square) BTDF matrix, which probably won't work with dctimestep.  That would make sense with the error you are seeing, but it can be no more than a guess without further clues from you.

Best,
-Greg

Subject: [Radiance-general] WINDOW 7.3 shut down with BSDF of Venetian
	blind created with genBSDF
Message-ID: <CALzUQjq=ycr9iZRVMouzJyq=Qw_-4XGg4jAn7V1MHBtUTEL1hw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Andrew,

Finally I added the +forward and +backward in genBSDF sentence, but the
problem continued. Then I compared many XML files BSDFs and I noticed
missing the first line with information from the encoding of the file:
<? xml version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"?>

I added that line manually and then, it was be exported to WINDOW smoothly.
It is rare that genBSDF did not put that line automatically. In this case,
I worked in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Radiance 5.0.

Regards,
Daniel

Hi Daniel,

This is a bug I hadn't realized was introduced in the recent overhaul of genBSDF.  Apparently, the character information gets stripped out and I wasn't replacing it as I should have been.  I just checked in a change that should fix the problem.

Thanks for pointing it out!

Cheers,
-Greg

  Hi Greg,
Excuse me, but, I am doing one exercise that is from the other team and I
do not know how the file.xml was get. Shortly I will start with my own case
study and I will use /genBSDF/ command and WINDOW 7.3 program to get the
files.xml.
Thank you for your attention.
Best wishes,
Urtza.

  Hi,

"kbin(0.7,-0.7,0,0,0,1)" and?-b "kbin(sqrt(.5),-sqrt(.5),0,0,0,1)"?work.
Thanks!

On the other hand, I have other problem with file.xml because with other
VenetianBlind.xml file works:?
C:\Users\Urtza\Desktop\AIE50\CFS>dctimestep results/photocellsRotated45.vmx
data
/Lasercut_Panel_145x1297.xml results/south.dmx Geneva.smx >
results/illum_lp.dat
fatal - unexpected column count in header

  Does anyone know what happen?
Thank you a lot,
Urtza.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Can rtrace be run by directing octree through
	stdin ?
Message-ID: <000001d09b38$596db420$0c491c60$@psu.edu>

Hi,

 

 

I have around 18 luminaire rad files and I want to run rtrace on all of them with the same set of ray inputs( which are in a text file). Since the room geometry will remain the same in each case, my octree will comprise of : room materials, room geometry and luminaire(18 of them, one at a time). So, I want to implement a loop where I can call oconv each time and  pipe the output directly to rtrace without writing the octree to disk.

 

 

An example in the man page is :  rtrace ?ov scene.oct < samples.inp > radiance.out

 

Is it possible to do something like : rtrace samples.inp <scene.oct>radiance.out. ? If yes, is there a specific flag that I should be using for the ray file(samples.inp) ? 

 

 

I have been able to make this work with rpict for images with something like : oconv  radfiles | rpict ?vf viewfile ?ab etc.. | pfilt | ra_ bmp etc, however I couldn?t find a way to create a similar pipe with rtrace. 

 

 

 

Thanks,

Sarith

Hi Sarith,

Since rtrace is looking for ray origins and directions on its standard input, you cannot send it an octree through a pipe.  However, you can run it like so:

	rtrace -ov "\!oconv -i static.oct lights1.rad" < samples.inp > radiance.out

The backslash before the '!' may not be necessary if your shell does not treat this character specially.  Basically, you give your command to create the octree in place of an octree file.  (This also works for rpict, rvu, and rcontrib.)

Cheers,
-Greg

Subject: [Radiance-general] Missing solar source visibility from gendaylit
	for multiple ambient-bounces
Message-ID: <556BD759.8040304@jakubiec.net>

Dear List,

I'm running into a bit of a frustrating issue, and I am not sure what 
the cause might be. I am creating a sky model using gendaylit with a 
high amount of direct solar component as seen below,
 > gendaylit 05 18 8.667 -W 881 63 -a 1 -o -104 -m -120

The issue is that when I render my scene using -ab 1, I can see the 
solar disc. When I render it with a higher number of ambient bounces, 
such as 4, the solar disc is absent from the final visualization. You 
can see the results here: 1 ambient bounce 
<https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3175325/ab1.png>, 4 ambient bounces 
<https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3175325/ab4.png>. You will notice 
that in the rendering with 4 ambient bounces, the shadows are still cast 
properly as if the sun is present.
I am using a slightly older version of Radiance right now (RADIANCE 4.2a 
lastmod  by  on w015t-001), but I suspect that isn't the root of the 
problem. This issue also occurs when I use gensky 
<https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3175325/ab4_clsky.png>. I have 
never seen this kind of behavior before from Radiance. Does anyone have 
thoughts as to what might cause this?

Thank you,
Alstan
