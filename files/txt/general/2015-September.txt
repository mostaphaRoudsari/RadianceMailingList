Subject: [Radiance-general] Daysim and results
Message-ID: <684637429.350166.1441191935358.JavaMail.yahoo@mail.yahoo.com>

Dear userSorry to post my question in this forum, but since it deals with daylight I think that it's ok.
A brief question about Daysim and results.I have made an analysis of a room where I compare the energy savings for artificial lighting by changing the ceiling reflectance. I look at two types of installed effect - 5 W/m2 and 10 W/m2. which is the only difference between the two calculations. There is no solar shading in the model.
I use the same model for both analyzes. This means that I only make a one calculation of daylight coefficients.?The light is controlled in both analyzes via photo sensors with dimming (photo-sensor control).
The for my question. Why is there a smaller increase in energy consumption of approximately 1 W/m2 by going from 5 W/m2 to 10 W/m2 installed power? Here I compare 2 x the energy consumption for 5 W/m2 with the energy consumption of 10 W/m2

I look forward to hearing from you

Best regards
Per Haugaard

Hello,

I think that might make sense. Imagine a room that is perfectly well
daylit, where you never need to turn the lights on. It will not matter
weather you installed 1W/m2 or 100W/m2, the energy consumption will always
be 0kWh/m2.

I would expect that, since you doubled the Lighting Power in the room, the
energy consumption also doubled. Does that make sense?

Otherwise... I am not quite sure how Daysim works.

Best,

Germ?n

Hi Germ?n,
Thank you for your reply.The annual energy consumption goes from e.g. 100 kWh/m2 to 108 kWh/m2 when going from an installed lighting power from 5W/m2 to 10 W/m2.It is the 8% increase I do not quite understand.Any input is much appreciated.

Best regards

Do you have the lighting control algorithm set to be dimming? If it was switching on and off for the same hours each year in two simulations, the energy use would be double. If the calculation assumes lights are dimmed, the 8% difference is only due to the interpolation difference between the low end energy use (minimum ballast power) and the upper end of the energy use. In other words, maybe you have many hours that daylight provides nearly all of the specified lux requirement, so your lights are always dimmed to a fraction of only 5W/m? or 10W/m? for most of the year at any times they are set to on.

I?m also not sure if your control algorithm might also assume that if you say the 10W/m? provides 600 lux and the 5W/m? provides 300 lux, but your daylight autonomy threshold is set to 300 lux, the calculation may never use the full 10W/m? load. I?m a bit out of practice with Daysim so I can?t recall for sure if either of these scenarios are likely to occur without knowing it.

Also, we might think about posting the question to Unmet Hours.

This was indeed a bug in the new photon-mapping code, and well-spotted by Martin!

I introduced this over-counting bug in my zealous attempt to simplify what Roland had done so skillfully the first time.  I took out a macro test that it turns out we need after all, so it has been reinstated in the routines I checked into the HEAD just this morning.  It certainly solves the problem in Martin's test case, and hopefully doesn't introduce any new issues.  (It shouldn't, being more or less an "undo" of my earlier modification.)

Message-ID: <F7DE55E2E535344E8C29DF9E3F331306010D6DEF8B@SBS1.varming61.local>

Hi All,

I'm relatively new to Radiance. I'm using the trans modifier and am coming across issues when rendering.

When I try to render my scene for Illuminance values, the output render removes the translucent material from the scene, exposing the interior to the external exterior. However when I render for luminance results, everything works fine.

Has anyone come across this issue before and know what might be causing the issue.

Thanks

Hi Garry,

This is probably one for the FAQ.  The "-i" option to rpict has special behavior for glass and trans surfaces, which are normally used to represent transparent materials.  I decided it was not very useful to visualize irradiance (or illuminance) on such surfaces, so my hack has rays just go right through them, allowing you to see whatever is on the other side.  This is not what everyone expects, however.

Rob Guglielmetti has this post showing the workaround if you really want to get irradiance on all of the first-intersected surfaces:

Garry,

I think this is its standard mode of operation.  Rendering illuminance really only makes sense in a pseudocolor type image (or perhaps one that is contoured).  A black and white surface that are side by side would have the same illuminance, so they would be rendered the same.  Determining the illuminance onto the emitting side of a trans surface doesn't really have much meaning (and I believe it is non-reflective), so the material is not shown (see the -i option on the rpict manpage).

For accurate visualization, luminance renderings should be selected (which is what our eye or a camera sees).

Subject: [Radiance-general] Irradiation on standing subject with Radiance
Message-ID: <CA+U776CaT_ePaqK2CRiVX=xoLu6=9gsbp3ZqCN97gvBVPszjEg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am trying to calculate the total radiation on a standing subject using
Radiance rtrace, but I am a bit stuck.

The first approach that comes to mind is to integrate over an idealised
vertical discretized cylinder, but this would be too computationally
expensive. I have to do the same calculation for several locations.

The second approach that comes to mind is to apply a bulk reduction factor,
but this would not be very accurate in the presence of direct radiation or
anisotropic diffuse radiation.

A third way could be to use rtrace to calculate the contribution to the
irradiation from the various sky patches and use the projection factor for
each one of them. As far as I understand though, rtrace provides the total
directional irradiation on an ideal surface placed in the point of interest
and perpendicular to the ray under examination. This corresponds to the
radiation generated from the portion of the sky visible from the surface.

Has anyone tried something similar? Do you have any recommendation?

Thanks
Ruggiero

Hi Ruggiero,

Is the standing subject inside a complex space?  Do you need this for an annual simulation?

If the answer to either of these questions is "no," then you can simplify the problem a bit.  If the answers are both "yes," then your third option of a daylight coefficient calculation will be the most efficient.  You basically want to compute random positions on the cylinder with the surface normal facing outwards, and give these to rcontrib to compute an integrated daylight coefficient for sky patches (and ground).

If you confirm that this is what you need, I can help you with the appropriate command chain if you like.

Cheers,
-Greg

Thanks Greg,

The subject is inside a complex urban environment and the calculation is
performed for a whole year or fraction of a year. However I need to keep
the hourly granularity because the irradiation information is used to
calculate other comfort parameters.

I would like to avoid the use of a cylinder all together if possible. For
example, for the direct solar radiation, I could simply have:

S_irrad = Id * fp(solar_altitude)

where:

- S_irrad is the irradiation on the subject,
- Id the direct radiation from the the sun
- fp(solar_altitude) the projected area of the subject in the direction of
the sun

My idea is to consider a dome around the subject: if I can calculate the
irradiation contribution for each direction I can then apply the projection
factor to each of these contributions and sum them up. This should give me
the total irradiation falling on the subject.

Thanks
Ruggiero

Well, the projected area of a cylinder is roughly the diameter times the height times the sine of the angle between the cylinder's axis and the sky patch (or solar disk) direction.  This would work if you didn't have the complex urban surroundings.  With the surroundings, there's no way I know to avoid a more complete view factor calculation, which is what rcontrib gives you.

That makes sense. So I guess that the third approach is the only way forward.?
I was thinking to define the subject as a prism with a rectangular base and maybe define a point or two for each face, so 5 points in total.?
Do you think this would be enough?

Hi Ruggiero,

I don't think the number of points is going to affect your rcontrib calculation that much.  You can always trade off the number of ambient divisions (-ad) to get more samples on the prism (or cylinder) for the same cost.  Here's an example set of commands.

# Generate 5 random sample positions on cap at height 2 with radius 0.2:

cnt 5 | rcalc -e 'HT:2;RAD:0.2' \
	-e 'rrad=RAD*sqrt(rand(.836*recno+.238));phi=2*PI*rand(-.3582*recno+.861);' \
	-e '$1=rrad*cos(phi);$2=rrad*sin(phi);$3=HT;$4=0;$5=0;$6=1' > samps.txt

# Generate 50 random body sample positions and directions:

cnt 50 | rcalc -e 'HT:2;RAD:0.2' \
	-e 'rht=HT*rand(.571*recno-.7633);phi=2*PI*rand(-.6716*recno-.1023)' \
	-e '$1=RAD*cos(phi);$2=RAD*sin(phi);$3=rht;$4=cos(phi);$5=sin(phi);$6=0' >> samps.txt

# average together 55 sample positions using rcontrib:

rcontrib -c 55 [other options] scene.oct < samps.txt > daycoef.mtx

Does this make sense?

P.S.  I just realized that to be a fair average, the number of samples on the cap should be proportional to the area, and same for the body.  A cap of radius 0.2 is 1/20th as large as the cylinder body of height 2, so in my example, there should be 20 times more samples on the body.  That means 5 samples on the cap would be paired with 100 samples on the body, or 105 samples in total.

Oh, and be sure to use the rcontrib -I+ option.  Corrected version immediately below.

# Generate 5 random sample positions on cap at height 2 with radius 0.2:

cnt 5 | rcalc -e 'HT:2;RAD:0.2' \
	-e 'rrad=RAD*sqrt(rand(.836*recno+.238));phi=2*PI*rand(-.3582*recno+.861);' \
	-e '$1=rrad*cos(phi);$2=rrad*sin(phi);$3=HT;$4=0;$5=0;$6=1' > samps.txt

# Generate 100 random body sample positions and directions:

cnt 100 | rcalc -e 'HT:2;RAD:0.2' \
	-e 'rht=HT*rand(.571*recno-.7633);phi=2*PI*rand(-.6716*recno-.1023)' \
	-e '$1=RAD*cos(phi);$2=RAD*sin(phi);$3=rht;$4=cos(phi);$5=sin(phi);$6=0' >> samps.txt

# average together 55 sample positions using rcontrib:

rcontrib -c 105 -I+ [other options] scene.oct < samps.txt > daycoef.mtx

Subject: [Radiance-general] Official 5.0 release
Message-ID: <00E9307F-7F3C-4BD9-956C-AEE17B29CE55@gmail.com>

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Announcing official Radiance 5.0 release
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

It's been over a year since the last official release, and 5 years since the last major one.  The biggest change is the addition of Roland Schregle's photon-mapping code, whose integration was sponsored and coordinated by the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts, Competence Centre Envelopes and Solar Energy (www.hslu.ch/ccease) in collaboration with the US Dept. of Energy.  Special thanks to Roland himself, Stephen Wittkopf, Lars Grobe, David Geisler-Moroder, and to Amir Roth, who covered my part in the final push.

Another significant addition/incorporation in 5.0 is Jan Wienold's evalglare tool, which he provided right before this year's workshop.  I would also like to thank Eleanor Lee (as always) for her ongoing support and management of Radiance development at LBNL.

The new release will be available from the following link, together with Mac OS X binaries (which hopefully work under Yosemite as well):

	http://www.radiance-online.org/download-install/installation-information/latest-release/release.html

NREL will post Radiance 5.0 binaries for Windows, Max and Linux on the NREL Radiance GitGub mirror, here:

	https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/tag/5.0

A number of important fixes and features come in addition to the photon map.  Below are a few highlights.

Cheers,
-Greg

++++++++++++++++++++

Created wrapBSDF tool and incorporated into genBSDF along
with new rfluxmtx computation.

Added left-hand coordinate sytems to rfluxmtx to correct
problems with coordinate axis orientations pointed out by
David Geisler-Moroder.

Added color output to genBSDF (+C option) and support for
color rendering of Klems and tensor tree data.

Fixed bug discovered by Jacob Jonsson in Klems BSDF
interpolator that caused it to over-predict normal
transmittance and reflectance.

Added ability to read input from commands in dctimestep
and rmtxop.

Added photon map support to rad.  Fixed some double-counting
issues in photon-mapping spotted by David Geisler-Moroder.

Added photon map support to trad.

Prompted by Roland S., added option to have pcompos -a order
rows from top rather than bottom of image.

Changed dctimestep to accept matrix as well as BTDF input
in the VTDs invocation mode.  This permits the output of
rmtxop to be used in a pinch when combining multiple BTDF
layers, although interreflection between layers is not
accounted for properly as it is in the WINDOW program.

Added Jan Wienold et al.'s evalglare to distribution.

Hopeful fix to deadlock issue under Mac OS X 10.10.x (Yosemite).

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Hello everyone:
I have a question concerning Radiance in Mac. I export the model from Rhino, and the rendering works well in Window system. Then I copy all the text files in Mac, the terminal gives me ?Segmentation fault: 11?. I saw others ran into the same error with gendaylit. But no matter with or without a sky file (I have artificial lights for night occasion), the file gives the same error. Does anyone else have the same experience?
Please feel free to ask for my file it you?d like to help me figure out. It is too large to share them. 

Thank you in advance.

More information is needed.  Which program where you running when you got the error, and on which file(s)?

Zhe,

I suspect line endings are causing your problem. Windows uses CR/LF as a
line ending. Unix uses LF. Often when a text file is created on Windows you
need to convert the line endings when those files are brought to Mac. Text
editors are usually fine with either, so it may not be noticeable when you
open the file in a text editor.

Here are some ways to do the conversion
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2613800/how-to-convert-dos-windows-newline-crlf-to-unix-newline-n-in-bash-script

Also, some text editors (such as Text Wrangler) allow you to set the line
endings when you do a save-as.

Andy

Yeah, that's not quite enough additional information. First off, did you Try Andy McNeil's tips about the linefeeds yet? Regardless, it would be most helpful if you supplied the actual commands you're entering for the whole workflow, and what "it failed to show up" actually means. It sounds like you may not have X11 set up and that could by why you're not getting anything when you try to run rvu. Details would help here...

More information is needed.  Which program where you running when you got the error, and on which file(s)?

Zhe,

I suspect line endings are causing your problem. Windows uses CR/LF as a
line ending. Unix uses LF. Often when a text file is created on Windows you
need to convert the line endings when those files are brought to Mac. Text
editors are usually fine with either, so it may not be noticeable when you
open the file in a text editor.

Here are some ways to do the conversion
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2613800/how-to-convert-dos-windows-newline-crlf-to-unix-newline-n-in-bash-script

Also, some text editors (such as Text Wrangler) allow you to set the line
endings when you do a save-as.

Andy

Hello,

I am completely new to Radiance and I am trying to install it on my Mac. I have Yosemite 10.10.5. I have to use Radiance for my Master thesis.
I am already having a hard time in the installation. I am trying to follow the video tutorial on the official website but it refers to an old version (of both website and Mac software): everything is a little bit different and I am doing something wrong. I can?t even start: as I type the command -xzf in order to extract the files, the terminal says: ?command not found?.
Does anyone know what I am doing wrong? Is there an updated tutorial where I can see what I have to do step by step?
Thank you!

Marta

If you are trying to unzip the latest release, the command is most likely:

tar -zxf rad5R0all.tar.gz

-zxf is options for the tar command, and the file name being unzipped is 
at the end.

Here are my personal notes for installing on Mac and Linux (arrow > 
means command line, double quotes means replace with appropriate file 
name, brackets are notes):

1) install XCode from App Store
2) install X11

3) compile, by running these commands
 > tar -xzf "radiance_release"
 > tar -xzf "HEAD"
 > cd ray/
 > sudo ./makeall install
(use default, or direct to newly made 'bin' folder)
(use default, or direct to 'lib' folder)
 > ./makeall library
(direct to 'lib' folder)

4) update your paths
 > nano ~/.profile

Put these three lines in the .profile text file, replacing the 
appropriate paths. Your paths will look different, but they are the 
paths to the 'bin' 'lib' and 'doc' folders created during the 
installation. If you're on a Mac, the file will most likely be empty. If 
it's not empty, you can add these three lines anywhere in the file.

export PATH=/Users/chris/Applications/rad50/ray/bin:$PATH
export RAYPATH=.:/Users/chris/Applications/rad50/ray/lib
export MANPATH=/Users/chris/Applications/rad50/ray/doc/man

5) close and reopen terminal, and test installation

 > which mkpmap
 > man mkpmap

Download mark stock's benchmark, open a terminal, change to the 
appropriate directory, and type:
 >tar -xf bench4.zip
 > cd bench4
(for single core, type:)
 >make
(for multi core, type:)
 >NCPU=2; make smp

It will take a bit of practice and patience to get familiar with the 
Unix command line, so give it time and take plenty of breaks (I 
recommend going to the gym).

Hope this helps,
Chris

I am still stuck on the first steps? as I type the command 

tar -zxf rad5R0all.tar.gz

I get the message:

tar: Error opening archive: Failed to open ?rad5R0all.tar.gz'

What does it mean?

Where do you want the library files [/usr/local/lib/ray]?

What should I type?

Hi Marta,

You should just download and use the package installer from NREL:

	https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/tag/5.0

It's much easier than compiling from source for those not used to such things.  Since you're on a standard OS X distribution, you should have no problem.  The recommendations for installing X11 and the developer tools still apply, however.

Cheers,
-Greg

P.S.  Scroll down the page to find the "Darwin" disk image, which is for Mac OS X (code named "Darwin" by developers, not by us).

Bello greg,
That's what I did, I downloaded the pre-compiled binary for Mac OSX. So what should I do next?
I can't create libraries and so on because I have absolutely no idea how to do... I want to cry!
Sorry but I feel completely ignorant in this subject.

Marta

Marta,

Not too many years ago, I was in the same place as you, and I 
fortunately had help from Rob Shakespeare (one of the authors of the 
book "Rendering with Radiance"). So, the least I can do is pass on the 
knowledge to the next generation of users. If you are still stuck after 
some trial and error, I would be happy to help out via personal 
communication.

If one looks back on the archives of this list, there is a constant 
exodus of young users who disappear after they get their masters/PhD's, 
so I am playing my part to take some of the burden off the senior 
developers by offering a little help here and there to the new users...

PS. for those who have read this far: How is the new knowledge base 
platform working? I was happy to hear there were some recent efforts, 
but I haven't seen or heard about it for a few weeks.

Best,
Chris

Hi Chris,

 

I had replied to one of those emails from afternoon.  I think the Penn State
webmail server isn't smart enough to figure out the difference between
personal emails and mailing lists.Anyway, my reply is below..

 

 

Actually, if you got as far as "Where do you want the library files.", you
can just follow along with Andy's video from around the 4:59 mark..
https://youtu.be/ptTmdKSfK68?t=4m59s

 

Instead of typing any  directory or path names you can just keep pressing
enter( or return) to select the default options.

Marta,

Not too many years ago, I was in the same place as you, and I fortunately
had help from Rob Shakespeare (one of the authors of the book "Rendering
with Radiance"). So, the least I can do is pass on the knowledge to the next
generation of users. If you are still stuck after some trial and error, I
would be happy to help out via personal communication.

If one looks back on the archives of this list, there is a constant exodus
of young users who disappear after they get their masters/PhD's, so I am
playing my part to take some of the burden off the senior developers by
offering a little help here and there to the new users...

PS. for those who have read this far: How is the new knowledge base platform
working? I was happy to hear there were some recent efforts, but I haven't
seen or heard about it for a few weeks.

Best,
Chris

Hi Marta,

 

You should just download and use the package installer from NREL:

 

            https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/tag/5.0

 

It's much easier than compiling from source for those not used to such
things.  Since you're on a standard OS X distribution, you should have no
problem.  The recommendations for installing X11 and the developer tools
still apply, however.

 

Cheers,

If you are trying to unzip the latest release, the command is most likely:

tar -zxf rad5R0all.tar.gz

-zxf is options for the tar command, and the file name being unzipped is at
the end.

Here are my personal notes for installing on Mac and Linux (arrow > means
command line, double quotes means replace with appropriate file name,
brackets are notes):

1) install XCode from App Store
2) install X11

3) compile, by running these commands
> tar -xzf "radiance_release"
> tar -xzf "HEAD"
> cd ray/
> sudo ./makeall install
(use default, or direct to newly made 'bin' folder)
(use default, or direct to 'lib' folder)
> ./makeall library
(direct to 'lib' folder)

4) update your paths
> nano ~/.profile

Put these three lines in the .profile text file, replacing the appropriate
paths. Your paths will look different, but they are the paths to the 'bin'
'lib' and 'doc' folders created during the installation. If you're on a Mac,
the file will most likely be empty. If it's not empty, you can add these
three lines anywhere in the file.

export PATH=/Users/chris/Applications/rad50/ray/bin:$PATH
export RAYPATH=.:/Users/chris/Applications/rad50/ray/lib
export MANPATH=/Users/chris/Applications/rad50/ray/doc/man

5) close and reopen terminal, and test installation

> which mkpmap
> man mkpmap

Download mark stock's benchmark, open a terminal, change to the appropriate
directory, and type:
>tar -xf bench4.zip
> cd bench4
(for single core, type:)
>make
(for multi core, type:)
>NCPU=2; make smp

It will take a bit of practice and patience to get familiar with the Unix
command line, so give it time and take plenty of breaks (I recommend going
to the gym).

Hope this helps,
Chris

Hi Marta,

Sorry this is all so confusing! Sounds like you grabbed the pre-built binaries from the NREL site. Let?s see if we can get you the rest of the way.?

1. Make sure you have the right installer. If you?re on MacOS, you want this one:

https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/download/5.0/radiance-5.0.0-Darwin.dmg

2. Double-click the installer ("radiance-5.0.0-Darwin.dmg?), and then double-click the file inside ("radiance-5.0.0-Darwin.pkg?). Click ?continue?, three times. Finally, click ?install? to run the installer accepting the default location(s) for everything.?

You now have Radiance installed on your mac. What this really means is that you have a while bunch of files installed to the following locations:

/usr/local/radiance/bin (the Radiance executables ? of which there are many, and ironically none of which are called ?Radiance?)
/usr/local/radiance/lib (the Radiance ?library folder? which contains loads of other important files used by Radiance)
/usr/local/radiance/man (the Radiance ?man pages?, or manual pages ? the main documentation to the Radiance programs

At this point, nothing actually works yet. =/ ?But, you?re close...

3. Next you need to add "/usr/local/radiance/bin? to your system path, and you need to create a new system variable called ?RAYPATH? and set it to "/usr/local/radiance/lib?. You can/should also add "/usr/local/radiance/man? to your MANPATH system variable. You can see Andy McNeil demonstrate using ?pico? to do this, starting at 7:38 in the video here:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptTmdKSfK68&feature=youtu.be&t=7m38s

NOTE: Be sure to use the paths I mention in this email and not the ones in Andy?s video.

After you do these three steps, you will have Radiance installed and functional. Then the fun really begins. =) Be sure to check out the tutorials here:

http://www.radiance-online.org/learning/tutorials

?and post any questions either here on this list, or over on Unmet Hours (https://unmethours.com/questions/). There are plenty of folks who are still here answering questions and offering advice, long after getting Ph.D.s. Matter of fact, some of us never even got Masters degrees. Still here.?

-Rob

Subject: [Radiance-general] Survey on occupant modelling practice in
	building simulation
Message-ID: <5606EC89.7020904@cunet.carleton.ca>

Dear colleagues,

I am conducting a survey to better understand assumptions that building 
simulation users make about occupants and occupant behaviour. This is 
part of International Energy Agency - Energy in Buildings and 
Communities Annex 66. I'd be greatly appreciative if you would take 15 
minutes and fill out the survey. For your effort, you have a chance to 
win a prize (see below) and you will have access to the aggregate survey 
results in 2016.

Please find the survey link and notice below.

Many thanks,

Liam O'Brien, PhD
Assistant Professor
Architectural Conservation and Sustainability Engineering
Carleton University

----------------------

The goal of this brief anonymous 38-question survey, aimed at 
practitioners (architects, engineers, other building modellers), is to 
inform researchers and software tool developers of current practices and 
attitudes about occupant modelling. Researchers are welcome to 
participate, but their responses may not be used in this study. The 
results will be securely and anonymously stored. Your information will 
not be shared with anyone. A summary of the aggregate results will be 
publicly released in approximately Summer 2016.

http://goo.gl/forms/sbvCS6z5Zw

When the survey closes (anticipated November 2015), the participants who 
provide an email address at the end of the survey will be randomly 
selected to win one of the following generously donated prizes:

  *      2 copies of the book ?Modeling, Design, and Optimization of
    Net-Zero Energy Buildings? edited by Andreas Athienitis and William
    O?Brien. 396 pages.
  *      1 copy of the book ?Building Performance Simulation for Design
    and Operation?, edited by Jan Hensen and Roberto Lamberts
  *      1 one-year subscription to the Journal of Building Performance
    Simulation
  *      3 BeeWi Bluetooth color LED smart light bulbs
  *      4 hard copies of ?Daylight in Buildings - A source book on
    daylighting systems and components?
  *      2 copies of the printed proceedings of SimAUD 2015 (Symposium
    on Simulation for Architecture and Urban Design)


Thanks for your time, in advance.

hello
Sorry if I ask repetitive question but i couldn't find the answer of my
question anywhere. i am a user of radiance via ecotect for some years,but
one of the disadvantages of this version of radiance is that, it doesn't
use weather data. so i decided yo use new version of radiance for windows.
i installed this version, but i don't know how i can use this radiance?
where should I model the room I want to simulate?

Fundamentally, you have to model your space by writing out the coordinates and materials in a text file following the correct .rad format, then use the command prompt to perform analysis commands on that. Otherwise, you have to model your space in a 3D CAD software and find a workflow to convert that to .rad (possibly export to .obj then use obj2rad command on the Windows command prompt). You could use Blender, Rhino, Sketchup, Ecotect, Groundhog, DIVA, su2rad, Honeybee, OpenStudio, etc., etc. as your modeling interface, some of which also include some interface to Radiance, or maybe to export into .rad format and do the rest at the command prompt.

To understand the workflow of what to do with a proper .rad file with materials and geometry (or write one yourself), maybe start with reading the tutorial which starts on page 17 of this PDF, and post your subsequent questions back here:
http://www.radiance-online.org/learning/tutorials/intro-to-rendering-with-radiance

After that there would be several more steps to build your way up to doing annual simulation. Otherwise DIVA, Groundhog, Honeybee, etc. might be a jump-start as they manage some of the annual simulation parameters ? but also take away some of the fun  ; )  of understanding what?s happening.

One other thing. Beware that tutorial is written for linux-like systems, so you?ll have to know that running the vi command is equivalent to opening up Notepad and typing a text file. You?ll also have to know that sometime after that tutorial, the rview command was renamed to rvu to avoid conflicts with other software, so type rvu anywhere the tutorial says to type rview.

Hi Shailan,

You also might consider the new SPOT Pro daylighting software, available
here <http://www.daylightinginnovations.com/spot-home>.  It is a Windows
based user friendly interface, with a Radiance engine behind the scenes,
that provides a variety of architectural lighting, daylighting and
photosensor simulation features.  Radiance is hidden behind the scenes but
still accessible to the advanced user.  It also has a built-in database of
all US TMY2 data sites, all TMY3 data sites available, and the ability to
import EPW weather files for analysis.

Regards,
Zack
