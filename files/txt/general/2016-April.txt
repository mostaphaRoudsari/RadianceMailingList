Hi Radiance team,

I am a student in an engineering school and I am currently doing an internship in a design office specialized in building envelope studies.

My work consist in developing a tool to determine precisely the solar factor of a facade, taking into account its shading devices and its geometry which can be complex sometimes.

My idea is to use the software Grasshopper to:

1.    Import a geometry

2.    Define the materials of the scene

3.    Create the Radiance geometry

4.    Create two analysis grid (vertical): one before the system "shading+facade" to determine the incident solar energy, and one inside my building to determine the transmitted solar energy.

5.    Then, use the Ray Tracing method to calculate the solar energy on each point...
This method seems interesting for my problematic but the calculations under the hood may be not relevant for solar energy, insofar as it is designed for light calculations and realistic rendering.

Questions :

1)    I apology if I am missing something obvious, I have done some researches about the "Ray tracing" method used by Radiance but I still have some interrogations about how it works... Is the ray divided in many rays when it punch a surface ? What is the different between the direct light and the diffuse light (in terms of modeling) ? Is there a way to convert R G B radiance provided by Radiance in solar energy for instance (like it is done for luminance) ?


2)    I must not be the first to process this kind of problematic, so I am wondering if it exists a calculation engine derived from Radiance which can provide the solar energy using a kind of "ray tracing" method?

For me, in principle, it is not that complicated, I mean it is possible. The problematic is purely geometric and mathematic. I imagine: the ray launched is define by a wave length, an intensity and a direction (to model the direct radiation). When it reaches a surface, the intensity took into account is the intensity of the surface's normal projection of the ray. Then the ray is divided in 3 rays: one transmitted, one reflected and one absorbed, whose proportions (in terms of intensity) and directions depend on the material definition of the surface reached. This last can react differently according to wavelength domain of the ray. Do the same with diffuse rays, to model the diffuse radiation. The absorbed part of the incident energy could be transformed in heat (Infrared radiation) according to the emissivity of the surface.

I am sorry about the lenth of the message. I really need to understand how I can do to determine solar energy through different kind of materials (translucent, transparent, opaque...). I would be really thankful if you help me! This project constitute my graduation project, it is quite ambitious that's why I need some guidelines.

Thank you in advance,
Yours sincerely

Dear S?verine,

 

from my point of view, if your interest lies with solar >energy< gain, then
Radiance is not really best suited. Typically, what you describe is covered
by thermal building simulation tools to a quite high degree of detail
(ESP-r, EnergyPlus, IDA-ICE, TRNSYS to name a few). It would likely be quite
difficult or probably even impossible e.g. to model the secondary heat gain
through windows / glazed facades (or opaque facades, for that matter). Also,
?what goes through? is not the whole story. What happens in the building is
also of major interest to be able to decide if the gains are ?useful? or
?harmful?.

 

Why do you think you need the ray tracing approach?

 

Best

Achim

Hi S?verine,

I often use Radiance for performing calculations in the solar range. In
that case, I just use grey surfaces (R=G=B=solar reflectance), and ask the
Perez sky models to give me solar instead of visible Radiance (I think this
is done using O1 option in the command line).

It is important to notice that these methods will not consider convection
and far infrared radiation, thus the absorbed-reemited heat will not be
considered.

On the other hand, depending on the geometry of your facade system, it
might be worth calculating the BSDF (using genBSDF). Then, the BSDF may be
imported to Window for estimating solar heat gain coefficient, considering
convection and FIR radiation.

If you want to avoid Window, the method used by it to calculate absorption
on each layer is very well documented y two papers by J.H.Klems. Then,
ISO15099 will give you a hint on how to calculate the solar heat gain
coefficient from all the information you have at that point.

Those three components would allow you, respectively, to:

1. Calculate transmission and reflection of each layer (genbsdf)
2. Calculate absorption on each layer (Klems)
3. Calculate the inward flowing fraction of the absorbed radiation
(iso15099)

Yes... Avoiding windows is hard.

Message-ID: <CA+fuGR7JaUWupaEAdTCfs1u_9_uMye8SoaB0Kmsqnm9RyA-S4w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys

I am using the three-phase method to run annual dynamic daylight simulation
of dynamic shading devices.

My question is, should I always define the window material like I have
below, no matter the characteristics of the window, and simply change the
XML file for different windows, or use the glass material and change the
properties of the material depending on the properties of the window and
use the correspondent XML file?

Hope i explained it clearly enough.

Yes, there is a -m multiplier option to falsecolor, which defaults to    -m 179    and should equate to lux or cd/m?. Luminance in cd/m2 is the default label to display luminance unless you give the   -l lux     option for example for illuminance - both related to the 179 lumen/Watt multiplier.

However for Watts you can use    -m 1    in your options to falsecolor along with    -l W/m2    to change the label to display as W/m2. That is presuming your image is calculated with -i option for irradiance. I don't think people would normally expect to see a Watts based radiance image in W/sr/m2.

This is also presuming the intent of your image takes into account all the shortcomings that Achim noted.

Dear S?verine,

 

I retract my answer from this morning ? not quite awake yet, sorry. Basically, I would support Germ?n. There is also the tool WIS available, which (also) calculates according to ISO 15099. Depending on the level of detail you are seeking, it may be of interest to look at the Tools ?TRISCO/VOLTRA? from Physibel. These would also include thermal transport through framing etc. if you are thinking of curtain walls (lots of metal, often). They are slightly less capable in terms of glass description but geared toward energy.

 

Anyway, developing a tool which goes beyond the mentioned (in depth of detail and accuracy) is definitely not an easy task ? good luck!

 

Best

Achim

Hi S?verine,

I often use Radiance for performing calculations in the solar range. In that case, I just use grey surfaces (R=G=B=solar reflectance), and ask the Perez sky models to give me solar instead of visible Radiance (I think this is done using O1 option in the command line).

It is important to notice that these methods will not consider convection and far infrared radiation, thus the absorbed-reemited heat will not be considered.

On the other hand, depending on the geometry of your facade system, it might be worth calculating the BSDF (using genBSDF). Then, the BSDF may be imported to Window for estimating solar heat gain coefficient, considering convection and FIR radiation.

If you want to avoid Window, the method used by it to calculate absorption on each layer is very well documented y two papers by J.H.Klems. Then,  ISO15099 will give you a hint on how to calculate the solar heat gain coefficient from all the information you have at that point.

Those three components would allow you, respectively, to:

1. Calculate transmission and reflection of each layer (genbsdf)
2. Calculate absorption on each layer (Klems)
3. Calculate the inward flowing fraction of the absorbed radiation (iso15099)

Yes... Avoiding windows is hard.

Dear S?verine,

 

from my point of view, if your interest lies with solar >energy< gain, then Radiance is not really best suited. Typically, what you describe is covered by thermal building simulation tools to a quite high degree of detail (ESP-r, EnergyPlus, IDA-ICE, TRNSYS to name a few). It would likely be quite difficult or probably even impossible e.g. to model the secondary heat gain through windows / glazed facades (or opaque facades, for that matter). Also, ?what goes through? is not the whole story. What happens in the building is also of major interest to be able to decide if the gains are ?useful? or ?harmful?.

 

Why do you think you need the ray tracing approach?

 

Best

Achim

Hi Radiance team,

 

I am a student in an engineering school and I am currently doing an internship in a design office specialized in building envelope studies. 

 

My work consist in developing a tool to determine precisely the solar factor of a facade, taking into account its shading devices and its geometry which can be complex sometimes.

 

My idea is to use the software Grasshopper to:

1.    Import a geometry

2.    Define the materials of the scene

3.    Create the Radiance geometry 

4.    Create two analysis grid (vertical): one before the system ?shading+facade? to determine the incident solar energy, and one inside my building to determine the transmitted solar energy.

5.    Then, use the Ray Tracing method to calculate the solar energy on each point?

This method seems interesting for my problematic but the calculations under the hood may be not relevant for solar energy, insofar as it is designed for light calculations and realistic rendering.

 

Questions :

1)    I apology if I am missing something obvious, I have done some researches about the ?Ray tracing? method used by Radiance but I still have some interrogations about how it works? Is the ray divided in many rays when it punch a surface ? What is the different between the direct light and the diffuse light (in terms of modeling) ? Is there a way to convert R G B radiance provided by Radiance in solar energy for instance (like it is done for luminance) ?

 

2)    I must not be the first to process this kind of problematic, so I am wondering if it exists a calculation engine derived from Radiance which can provide the solar energy using a kind of ?ray tracing? method? 

 

For me, in principle, it is not that complicated, I mean it is possible. The problematic is purely geometric and mathematic. I imagine: the ray launched is define by a wave length, an intensity and a direction (to model the direct radiation). When it reaches a surface, the intensity took into account is the intensity of the surface?s normal projection of the ray. Then the ray is divided in 3 rays: one transmitted, one reflected and one absorbed, whose proportions (in terms of intensity) and directions depend on the material definition of the surface reached. This last can react differently according to wavelength domain of the ray. Do the same with diffuse rays, to model the diffuse radiation. The absorbed part of the incident energy could be transformed in heat (Infrared radiation) according to the emissivity of the surface.

 

I am sorry about the lenth of the message. I really need to understand how I can do to determine solar energy through different kind of materials (translucent, transparent, opaque?). I would be really thankful if you help me! This project constitute my graduation project, it is quite ambitious that?s why I need some guidelines.

 

Thank you in advance, 

Yours sincerely

Hi Humberto,

Your question is a treacherous one to answer, because you have not told us your whole workflow.  Normally, you would perform three steps (or phases) in a 3-phase calculation.  One would involve interior flux transfer, where you would have a window material such as the one you defined as your receiver modifier in rcontrib or rfluxmtx.  Another phase would compute the exterior using this same description as a source for rfluxmtx or passed to genklemsamp with rcontrib.  This would end up being multiple runs if you have different window elevations.  The final phase would involve multiple runs of dctimestep fed by genskyvec or an entire year fed by gendaymtx, where you multiply these runs by the number of different XML files you have for your window system.  In the end, you would use your own custom calculation to decide which window condition fit with each time point, and I can't really help you with that part.

Best,
-Greg

Achim,
I would say your answer is an important one to keep in mind, regarding the limitations of any chosen process and how the information will be used. Is the intent for system peak capacity relying on comprehensive energy accounting? Or only relative performance comparison of shading systems where insulation properties would be similar amongst them all?

I?m not an expert in the software you listed (ESP-r, EnergyPlus, IDA-ICE, TRNSYS, etc.), but I do suspect some or all of them may have limited accuracy in angular dependent complex fenestration. By my guess they might be able to do reasonably well at comprehensive energy modeling of a simple overhang or external light shelf. But if you have a custom designed louver system you may get more accurate direct radiation calculations using Radiance. However if it?s important for your intentions, you would certainly need some other energy modeling tools to consider the bigger picture of heat transfer (insulation, etc.).

Dear S?verine,

I retract my answer from this morning ? not quite awake yet, sorry. Basically, I would support Germ?n. There is also the tool WIS available, which (also) calculates according to ISO 15099. Depending on the level of detail you are seeking, it may be of interest to look at the Tools ?TRISCO/VOLTRA? from Physibel. These would also include thermal transport through framing etc. if you are thinking of curtain walls (lots of metal, often). They are slightly less capable in terms of glass description but geared toward energy.

Anyway, developing a tool which goes beyond the mentioned (in depth of detail and accuracy) is definitely not an easy task ? good luck!

Christopher,

thanks for the ?heads up?. I retracted because the original question was towards ?solar factor? (I assume SHGC) of facades, not actually ?what happens in the space behind the facade? as far as my second, somewhat closer reading revealed. As you write, the programs mentioned by me originally are less adept in giving detailed answers to this question (with the possible exception of ESP-r, which can be used as kind of a non-building-focused ?physics toolkit?).

So, to my understanding the goal seems to be a tool to calculate SHGC of facades with (complex) shading systems. However, as SHGC includes secondary heat flux (re-distribution of absorbed solar radiation), I am not quite sure how Radiance can really help, here. Therefore my support of Germ?n / ISO 15099 (e.g. WIS has been shown to give good agreement with measurement results for ventilated double facades with venetian blinds in the facade gap). Also, e.g. in the U.K. it became increasingly normal a few years ago to include framing / panels in facade-SHGC values. Therefore possibly the Physibel products.

I agree that the central question of interest should be clarified in detail first. And I would also hesitate to think it realistic to actually develop a new tool that has any advantage over one of the available ones. But, then, I?m quite out of programming and am not up to date to current development speeds possible.

Best
Achim

I imagine: the ray launched is define by a wave length, an intensity and a direction (to model the direct radiation). When it reaches a surface, the intensity took into account is the intensity of the surface?s normal projection of the ray. Then the ray is divided in 3 rays: one transmitted, one reflected and one absorbed, whose proportions (in terms of intensity) and directions depend on the material definition of the surface reached. This last can react differently according to wavelength domain of the ray. Do the same with diffuse rays, to model the diffuse radiation. The absorbed part of the incident energy could be transformed in heat (Infrared radiation) according to the emissivity of the surface.

Thank you Chris.

 From an irradiance image (-i) I didn't realise a multiplier of 1 in 
falsecolor provided units in W/m^2

I accept the reservations. For this project a gross mapping over a large 
site with block building shapes, the results can only be construed as 
indicative.

Hi Randolph,

it's hard to tell without additional information -  calculation time 
depends on so many factors, mainly on the amount of glare pixels found 
AND on the parameters you are submitting to evalglare.
But 15min is VERY unusual with this size of the image.
run it with the -d option and write also a checkfile with -c . Please 
post then the full header of the checkfile (output of getinfo, please 
keep all characters of including all tabs and spaces) and the output you 
get on standard output.

Do you create the image with a proxy geometry?

Jan

Hi Randolph,

your header looks ok, I just wanted to be sure there are no "technical" 
reasons for the strange behavior (e.g. a tab in from of a EXPOSURE or 
multiple exposures might cause troubles.)

The trouble you run into is, that you detect a lot of glare pixels. It 
seems your selected task area is rather dark (average luminance in that 
area is 26cd/m2), that means in that case all pixels above 26*5=128cd/m2 
are treated as potential glare sources. So around 80-90% of the image is 
treated as glare source pixels and since you don't have any pixel over 
50000 cd/m2 (max is 13559) all these pixels are summarized to one glare 
source.

I don't know details about your scene (maybe you can send me also an 
example image), but I would assume that the luminance of the task area 
you have defined does not correspond to the adaptation luminance, which 
I expect to be higher in an environment with an average luminance of 636 
cd/m2.
I guess if you look at the output image, more or less everything except 
the area you have defined is treated as glare source.
If the space is used in a usual way (lets say similar like office tasks, 
computer or reading tasks), then the applied setting is not working 
properly. If the task is a computer screen, then probably you have to 
increase the luminance of the screen to 120-200cd/m2. If the 25 cd/m2 is 
realistic (e.g. you have a dark screen) then I would probably apply a 
fixed value (e.g. 2000cd/m2) as threshold for the glare source detection 
(-b 2000). Or just run evalglare without any task option, in that case 
any pixel larger than 5*636=3180cd/m2 is treated as a glare source. This 
might lead to more realistic glare sources.
In principal it is good to check which parts of the scene are detected 
as glare pixels, that's why I integrated the -c option (coloring the 
detected glare sources) from the beginning, because algorithms can 
always fail and the detection of realistic glare sources in any kind of 
scene is a rather challenging task. That's why I also have implemented 
three detection options (fixed threshold, average luminance threshold 
and the task area threshold method). In my experiments, the task area 
option worked best, but in other situations (probably like yours) it 
might be better to apply another algorithm.

With less detected pixels you have also much less calculation time, 
which was your original concern. The scenes I'm evaluating usually, the 
calculation time mostly does not exceed 30s. For the annual glare 
evaluation using DGP, I've developed another method where the generation 
of the image and the evalglare evaluation takes in average less than a 
second in total for one timestep , based on a simplified image (-ab 0) 
and daylight coefficient method to derive the illuminance at eye level 
(based on daysim, but this can be done also with the 3 or 5 phase method).

But important to know: If you expect, that the contrast between task 
(e.g. if the 25cd/m2 are "real" and people would adapt to this level) 
and background (e.g. 1000cd/m2) is a problem, then I'm afraid that none 
of the existing glare metrics will detect that properly -even if you 
adjust the parameters and glare sources are detected more realistically. 
We are currently planning experiments to overcome this problem, but this 
needs some time to improve the existing models.

Thanks. I didn't think to light the screen, duh, despite just having read
that piece of the man page multiple times. To save recalculation I will
probably start using "-b 750" or "-b 1000" instead, which is about five
times the brightness of your typical LCD.

 For the annual glare evaluation using DGP, I've developed another method...


Have you published this method yet?

Ouch! Yes, that makes sense.

Thank you very much.

We recently had an inconclusive discussion of computer languages over
on radiance-dev. At the end of it, I was left wondering what languages
people are using in their research, engineering, and design practices.

My impression is that Python has become something of a standard in the
research community, with tools like SciPy, NumPy, and SAGE widely
used, though Perl has a library comparable to NumPy in PDL, and there
is a SciRuby also, of course, LISP.

On the statistical side there is R and Excel and LibreOffice Calc.

Then there is MATLAB, Mathematica, MAPLE, and even Maxima is still around.

I suppose we might also have some Visual Basic and C# users around

So who is using what? What do people like?

I would think that ruby would be a good candidate due to its close 
tie to OpenStudio and measure writing.

I started using Ruby because the SketchUp API is in that language, and I
think it is a great language with thousands of freely available modules,
tutorials, documentation, etc. It also allows multithreading, which is
awesome.

Some people say it is slow, but since I usually mix Ruby with Radiance, the
slowest parts are always due to the ray-tracing process (increasing
performance on the script will reduce the run time very little).


I understand a lot of people uses Python, though... I have not been able to
get used to that language.

Best,

I'm under the impression that people choose programming languages based on
the APIs that make them necessary. Projects that allow us to start from
scratch using any language of our choosing are quite rare once we move past
the level of a school homework assignment.

I use C# for Rhino/Grasshopper, 3ds Max, and Autocad plug-ins, Ruby for
SketchUp, C for Radiance programming, and good old DOS and Bash for
Radiance scripting because those are the languages supported and/or
languages used in others' work that I've adapted. For small projects that I
really can start from scratch, I use Java because it's the first language I
learned.

My two cents on this thread: Pick the language that is appropriate to your
project, not the language that you've heard is "popular".

Bingo.


My two cents on this thread: Pick the language that is appropriate to your project, not the language that you've heard is "popular".

Bingo, again.

As for me I use Ruby for scripting (now), precisely for the API reason Nathaniel stated above. SketchUp's API is Ruby, so the OpenStudio team exports the C++ codebase to Ruby too, and that's how our internal scripts or "measures" are written. Prior to that though, I used Python, at Schorsch's urging (this goes all the way back to 2003). Still using bash too though. For stats and dataviz, I'm trying to use R and JavaScript libraries, but also fall back on Excel/VBA because I know it. R is great for large datasets though. If I was still doing a lot of Python, I imagine the same could be accomplished with matplotlib/numpy though. Nathaniel said all of this more succinctly. I'm out!

I focus on bash because little snippets help just as much on the standard terminal as they do in a script. I'm not writing plugins so I've never thought about API compatibility, but only how quickly I can figure out how to do what I need. I had two intro courses to C++ long ago in high school and college, so as my "native tongue" of programming, anything I can relate to that tends to be most comfortable to me.

I've picked up a few python snippets from the web for large data file manipulation. I don't find the language very intuitive from the few examples I've used, but it definitely handles data well.

I've never even investigated Ruby or PERL. Do both handle large data sets quickly and efficiently? Is either one more relatable to bash or C++?

Regarding Randolph's original question, I suppose I've had some LISP exposure through AutoCAD but not at all recently. And more recent working experience with MATLAB and Mathematica.

Ruby and Perl are both more relatable to Bash, as they all are interpreted
loosely-typed languages.

For a trivial example of transposing a matrix tab delimited data file... which of these is most easily understood, reproducible, and fastest. Also note, I couldn't find a working Ruby example...


perl -anF'\t|\n' -e'$n=@F-1if!$n;for(0..$n){push@{$$m[$_]},$F[$_]} END{print map{join"\t",@$_,"\n"}@$m}'
^^ this takes a quarter of a second on 148K file, and doesn't look particularly clean but I could probably figure it out by researching the documentation

python -c "import sys; print('\n'.join(' '.join(c) for c in zip(*(l.split() for l in sys.stdin.readlines() if l.strip()))))"
^^ this takes half a second on 148K file but looks a bit baffling to me

awk '{for (f=1;f<=NF;f++) col[f] = col[f]":"$f} END {for (f=1;f<=NF;f++) print col[f]}' | tr ':' ' '
^^ this takes 2 seconds on 148K file which isn't very good, but probably the easiest to interpret by eye, in my opinion

ruby -e 'puts readlines.map(&:split).transpose.map{|x|x*" "}'
^^ I couldn't make this or any other Ruby examples I found online work, which might mean I have a basic misunderstand of how to type this in a single line workflow on the terminal. And all the examples I could find look like a black box to me because apparently there are functions built in to do this task.

echo '' >tmp1;  cat m.txt |while read l ; do paste tmp1 <(echo $l | tr -s ' ' \\n)>tmp2; cp tmp2 tmp1; done
^^ this series of commands is basically disqualified because it takes far too long

In alphabetical order: bash, c, c++, clojure, haskell, java, R.

Haskell is often the quickest to write and and runs as compiled code --
comparable to intelligently written but un-optimized c, c++ and Java. The
learning curve is painfully steep.

I would agree with a lot that's been said so far. My two cents:

Pick the language that's best for the project at hand, not one you just
"know".

For me, a quick script is best written in Python (I'm very familiar with
syntax/semantics of the language), but if I'm starting a "real" project, I
would look at the tasks needed to be done and how best to do them (e.g.
available data structures, API's, object oriented or not) then look at
different languages, first the ones I know, then even check out others.

Sometimes, however, with larger projects where speed is starting to be a
concern, you need to pick languages based on computation. For example, C
and Fortran are much faster than say Matlab for large matrix manipulation.

This is a very DEEP topic, which some EECS/CS people spend their whole
lives answering.

Good luck in your projects!

Oh, my! I wasn't trying to start a "Which language is best"
discussion, truly, I wasn't.

Personally, in participating in a large long-standing research,
engineering, or design community I'm inclined to stick with the common
languages of the community, at least when I can afford them.
(Autodesk, I'm looking at you.) So that was the basis of my question;
what would fit in in this community? The answer, so far, seems to be
that there are multiple communities of Radiance users who use varied
tools. Hunh. Some tools that aren't being spoken for here: I know
there are people using MATLAB with Radiance, for instance, and none of
them have spoken up.

I'm surprised that higher-level tools aren't getting any play in this
discussion; things NumPy, SciPy, and SciRuby. Why, after all, write
your own transpose routine when you can download a tested one, and
also get a tested package that includes more difficult operations like
inversion and calculation of eigenvalues? Perhaps only Greg and Andy
and a few others need the really fancy math here?

My first "major" language was Autolisp (the veterans here will 
remember).
That got me hooked on the functional approach, which I still value today
in other languages.

Then I found that the API had a very nasty bug (IRRC, "(entget)" without
picking anything crashed Autocad R7 on SunOS), which made me look into 
C.
There I learned that even a seemingly "simple" language can give you
tremendous power.

Next I learned the object oriented approach with Oberon. Directly at
the source and on the original Oberon hardware (never met Wirth himself,
though). Since then, encapsulation and inheritance come naturally to me,
but I also detected that I didn't like the overly verbose Pascal syntax.

While working on a Radiance GUI in Autolisp (yes, that's a thing),
I discovered a then rather new and largely unknown language. It combined
functional and object oriented features (both optional), and had a 
simple
syntax that would not get into the way.
The current incarnation of Python is still my language of choice.
Fortunately, most relevant 3D software (minus Sketchup) has a Python
API nowadays.

Working on code from others, I gradually acquired the basics of C++.
While that one makes memory management simpler than in C (using
predefined classes and templates), I'll probably never manage to dig
into most of the more complicated features in there.

And more recently, I did some deeper excursions into JavaScript.
That's the price to pay when you want to bring interactive 3D
graphics to the web...

Follow up question:

Using gendaylit rather than the gensky sky generator we have additional 
-O options. -O 1 for W/m^2/sr solar radiation.

    /From the gendaylit man page:
    The output can be set to either the radiance of the visible
    radiation, the solar radiance (full spectrum) or the luminance.
    //*-O*//[0|1|2] (0=output in W/m^2/sr visible radiation (default),
    1=output in W/m^2/sr solar radiation, 2=output in lm/m^2/sr luminance)./

Looking at the source code it appears the -O 0 option divides 
illuminance by 179 whilst the -O 1 and -O 2 don't. I couldn't see how 
the units are outputted from gensky (in relation to the 179 multiplier) 
to allow me to compare it to the gendaylit options.

One might assume that the -O 0 option would be set to similar units as 
the gensky generator.

 From this confusion what multiplier should be used with the falsecolor 
program when using gendaylit options 0, 1 and 2 remembering that 
falsecolor has the default -m 179?

(I all cases I would be using the rpict -i option and looking for units 
in W/m^2)

To further expand on the multiplier question? here?s my interpretation to be corrected if anyone understands differently?
-O 0 would give Watts of energy within the visible spectrum in the sky model, and apply the default 179 multiplier to convert to lumens in any outputs.
-O 1 would give Watts of energy across the full solar spectrum in the sky model, and typically would have to set a multiplier of 1 to keep Watts in any outputs.
-O 2 would give lumens of energy in the visible spectrum in the sky model, and you would have to set a multiplier of 1 to keep that in any outputs. I agree I?m not sure why to do this instead of the default 179 multiplier.

Yes, there is a -m multiplier option to falsecolor, which defaults to    -m 179    and should equate to lux or cd/m?. Luminance in cd/m2 is the default label to display luminance unless you give the   -l lux     option for example for illuminance ? both related to the 179 lumen/Watt multiplier.

However for Watts you can use    -m 1    in your options to falsecolor along with    -l W/m2    to change the label to display as W/m2. That is presuming your image is calculated with -i option for irradiance. I don?t think people would normally expect to see a Watts based radiance image in W/sr/m2.

This is also presuming the intent of your image takes into account all the shortcomings that Achim noted.

Message-ID: <002201d196fa$d73d3c40$85b7b4c0$@ilek.uni-stuttgart.de>

Hello,

 

I have a problem with su2rad. I am using SketchUp Make 2015 and
su2rad_daysim_r03. Unfortunately, the export doesn't work, neither by
colour/layer nor by "daysim". 

Exports by colour and by layer generate the .rif file and a few directories,
but as I try to import it into daysim, the following error message appears:

"Cannot find files:

.\radiance\medium

.\radiance\ambfiles\untitled1.amb

.\1)"

Export by "daysim" doesn't work at all. The following error message appears:

"Error reading file: prefs.dat"

 

Moreover, the material assignment doesn't work as well. It's impossible to
drop the radiance materials over the SketchUp elements.

 

Can anybody help me? I would really appreciate it.

 

Weidenmeise

Message-ID: <5710FA25.6060502@epfl.ch>

some more explanations:

about gendaylit:
to understand the output you have to know what gendaylit does and on 
what models it is based:
Gendaylit uses
- a sky luminance distribution model according to Perez ( details and 
publication reference see manpage),
- a luminance efficacy model according to Perez(details and publication 
reference see manpage), because the conversion factor between solar 
spectrum units and photometric units (=luminance efficacy) is changing 
depending on the sky type and situation (for example, close to sunset, 
the infrared proportion of the radiation increases a lot)
- it generates automatically the skytype based on the radiation data 
(and time and location)
Gendaylit assumes, that the input is given via the -W (direct 
normal,diffuse horizontal) or -G (direct horizontal and diffuse 
horizontal) is radiation in the solar spectrum.
The output option -O 1 does not apply any luminance efficacy model, but 
is using the Perez sky distribution.  Therefore when you "put in" solar 
spectrum you get also radiometric units as output. e.g. if you run 
rtrace -I , then the output is directly W/m2.
The output option -O 2 applies the the Perez sky distribution AND the 
luminance efficacy model. The output units are directly in photometric 
quantities. e.g. if you run rtrace -I you get directly a lux value.
The output option -O 0 (default) does the same as the -O 2 option EXCEPT 
the output is divided by 179. This is mainly done to be consistent with 
the output of gensky.


about gensky:
it generates sky distributions according to the CIE model. you have to 
specify explicitly the sky type (sunny, overcast...)
gensky does not apply any luminance efficacy model (at least I don't 
know any option to do so) . So you get as output unit what you put into 
it! So if you put in a solar spectrum power, then your output is also 
radiometric. If you put in only the power in the visible range, then you 
get the photometric quantities.
But don't put in radiometric and then expect the output to be 
photometric quantities!! The 179lm/W conversion is not a luminance 
efficacy model, it is just a "chosen" convention to calculate from the 
radiation (in the visual spectrum) to the photometric quantities. It 
does not take into account, that for example the luminance efficacy of 
the sun is between 80-100 lm/W (or during sunset it drops to 50 lm/W), 
whereas an overcast sky has about 130 lm/W.

as conclusion:
When you are just interested in the solar spectrum, then the difference 
for a specific skytype (e.g. completely sunny) between gendaylit  -O 1 
and gensky is "only" the sky luminance distribution.
When you are interested in photometric quantities AND your input data is 
based on the solar spectrum(e.g. from a EPW file or measured), then you 
should use gendaylit only (except you calculate externally the luminance 
efficacy and run then gensky).

Somewhat off-topic, but...

Out of curiosity, I played around with those examples a bit.
I had to slightly modify all of them, first to get Perl and Ruby to run
at all, and then to make sure all of them produce tabs instead of 
spaces.
Btw: The Perl version adds an extra tab at the end of each line.


perl -anF'\t|\n' -e'$n=@F-1 if \!$n;for(0..$n){push@{$$m[$_]},$F[$_]} 
END{print map{join"\t",@$_,"\n"}@$m}'

python -c "import sys; print('\n'.join('\t'.join(c) for c in 
zip(*(l.split() for l in sys.stdin.readlines() if l.strip()))))"

ruby -e 'puts readlines.map(&:split).transpose.map(){|x|x*"\t"}'


The result shows (as expected) that this kind of comparison is utterly
meaningless. There are simply too many factors out of your control
that can influence the result. Between Perl and Python, the
executables that happen to be installed on my box pretty much get the
opposite result than you reported. Maybe my Python is in better shape
than yours, because it gets more exercise... ;)

I'm actually a bit surprised by the bad performance of Perl. One of
the reasons may be the suboptimal algorithm, which explicitly loops
through the data in the interpreter. The other two use a functional
approach, where the heavy lifting is handled in C. Ruby has a slower
startup time, but its operating performance is much closer to Python.
I also didn't expect that much of a speed-up with Python 3 over 2.

The Python version is easy to understand, once you know that the
builtin function zip() is equivalent to Rubys transpose(). The rest
is IO and string manipulation. You also may not be familiar with
generator expressions. Very powerful stuff!

Schorsch, Thanks! Precisely the type of response I was trying to poke for. I threw something together in a few minutes from a quick google search just to steer the conversation. I certainly didn't do much quality comparison, and zero thinking about if any of these are really the right way to do it. My primary note is that we can debate the optimal, but the collective mental barriers and user-group predisposition, and size or quality of searchable online resources should be considered. I'm not the best person to consider them since I have very little depth in any language, but just noting to keep novices like me in mind. I honestly don't know if those make a case for any one language, but I felt compelled to add my two cents - since everyone else was talking about APIs which I have no concern for.

I always wish that threads like this one gave me more definitive suggestions for putting more effort in any one language (which, of course, is asking too much!).

The "definitive suggestions" you're hoping for will always necessarily
be highly subjective. If you want help deciding which language to
learn next, you'll have to ask more specific questions.

My personal preference is no secret. Now the discussion here (and on
radiance-dev) has prompted me to finally have a much closer look at
Ruby than before. Unfortunately, that hasn't really improved my
opinion about it...

But is that relevant to you? Since I don't know what you're actually
looking for, I have no idea.

Cheers

I had recently been assuming python would become our go-to for data manipulation based on popularity, but I'm learning that shouldn't be my assumption within the Radiance community - which I bet was Randolph's original intent in this thread.

Maybe I'll attempt Ruby for the next solution I need to sort out.

For me personally, I'll probably never really "learn" any of these, I'll just Google search snippets to cobble together whatever I need - but only when bash can't do it well and the internet can present a better solution   : )    I suppose I could say I've "learned" bash because I've examined enough snippets and written enough from scratch for multiple years, but unless I attempted to abandon bash and tried to do all of my six-scripts-per-year in python/ruby/etc I'll remain a newbie in each one.

Sorry - didn't mean to hijack the thread - just throwing in an extra perspective. I don't really need any specific guidance at the moment.

-Chris

Hi Chris,

I have the same issue with passing familiarity with too many languages.  Despite having written a whole GUI in Tcl/Tk, I have a horrible time understanding even what I've written in the language.  In contrast, even the most obfuscated bit of code in C seems easy enough to follow.

Perl is somewhere in-between for me.  It's a bit ugly, but similar enough to C for me to follow along without having to struggle too much.  I can't say the same for Python or even C++, mostly because I never really got comfortable with the object-oriented approach, despite having spent more than half my programming career employing it.  I'm definitely one of those reluctant adopters, where most of my C++ code follows a strong procedural bent.

I agree with what you said earlier about the advantage of scripting is that you can go freely between command-line and batch file.  It makes the evolution from running a few commands until you get it right to putting what you need in a script so much easier.  Unfortunately, there isn't one command interpreter that works cross-platform, which is why we have the issue with too many C-shell utilities in Radiance.

-Greg

Subject: [Radiance-general] Annualised Radiation Mapping
Message-ID: <5715E5E3.1080807@ocpms.com.au>

I have been looking into the radmap script (available from 
http://www.bozzograo.net/radiance/index.php) of Francesco Anselmo. Apart 
from converting the .pic files to .hdr and adding an extra line at 711 
to remove 'rvu' rather than 'rview' from the viewfile lines the script 
runs on the more updated versions of radiance available today. (Pity it 
doesn't use rpiece to utilise multiple cores though...)

 From what I can see radmap uses gensky throughout - therefore the CIE 
standard sky and horizontal direct irradiance from the weather file.

Has anybody done work utilising the Perez sky model (gendaylit) for 
annualised irradiation/illumination mapping or created newer 
methodologies for annualised mapping?

I wouldn't jump to any conclusions about overall "popularity" from the
few responses to this thread. Of the people out there who have actually
written and published tools for Radiance, most did not respond.

On the other hand, Python versions of a number of the common scripts
in Radiance will be added to the distribution in the near future.
That will simplify a few things, especially for Windows users.
Of course that still doesn't mean that anyone has to learn the language
who doesn't otherwise care about it.

Cheers

Dear Thomas,
 
unfortunately it doesn?t help. I?ve already tried it out with SketchUp Make 2015 and 2016. Could there possibly be any problem with the ?Make? version or with my Windows version? I use Windows 7 Enterprise Service Pack 1 (64-bit). I would be grateful for any hint.
 
Best regards,
Marzena

Please update to the latest release su2rad_2014.0.0. This should fix the problem. You can download it via the link below:

Moreover, the material assignment doesn?t work as well. It?s impossible to drop the radiance materials over the SketchUp elements.
 
Can anybody help me? I would really appreciate it.

Hi

In the framework of an european project done several years ago, I built monthly and annual mean sky models using gensky and some additional home made programs. You may read about this in the report available here (especially chapter 3.2.1):
https://multidoc.eia-fr.ch/record/396?ln=en

The stuff I developed is still working properly but I cannot distribute it because no proper documentation is available. However if you need, I could provide you with such sky models (as radiance scene files) for a few locations.

Hi

I just tried it with SketchUp Make 2016 on a Windows 10 system. I'm pretty
sure there isn't a general problem with Windows 7 or I'd have heard about
it by now.

Can you try to export again with the Ruby console window open, please?
There should be some information when the script starts and especially when
there is an error. Please copy the output and send it over.

Regards,
Thomas

Dear Thomas,

 

unfortunately it doesn?t help. I?ve already tried it out with SketchUp Make 2015 and 2016. Could there possibly be any problem with the ?Make? version or with my Windows version? I use Windows 7 Enterprise Service Pack 1 (64-bit). I would be grateful for any hint.

 

Best regards,

Marzena

Hi Marzena

 

Please update to the latest release su2rad_2014.0.0. This should fix the problem. You can download it via the link below:

Hello,

 

I have a problem with su2rad. I am using SketchUp Make 2015 and su2rad_daysim_r03. Unfortunately, the export doesn?t work, neither by colour/layer nor by ?daysim?. 

Exports by colour and by layer generate the .rif file and a few directories, but as I try to import it into daysim, the following error message appears:

?Cannot find files:

?\radiance\medium

?\radiance\ambfiles\untitled1.amb

?\1)?

Export by ?daysim? doesn?t work at all. The following error message appears:

?Error reading file: prefs.dat?

 

Moreover, the material assignment doesn?t work as well. It?s impossible to drop the radiance materials over the SketchUp elements.

 

Can anybody help me? I would really appreciate it.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Preview error - unknown object type "ashik2"
Message-ID: <57189862.2060501@stuba.sk>

Hello,

please I need help. Whenever I run objpict or objview or rvu, I get the 
same warning each and every time:
/rpict/ (or rvu accordingly)/: warning - unknown object type "ashik2" /
This error repeats no matter what I try to preview, a simple chair or a 
more complex model.
The preview than is/is not produced - I was not able to identify the 
trigger.

I am new to Radiance (and Linux). I got aware of this problem since I 
reinstalled Radiance from the NREL Radiance releases (I did this because 
I realised I was missing some files).

If I do understand it well, ashik2 should be an anisotropic BRDF model, 
describing the appearance of a material, and it is a calculation model - 
so "something built in".

Please, how do I fix the problem? Can please someone explain what went 
wrong?

I also get an X11 error. /

/This was already once discussed on the mailing list, but was not 
somehow resolved. I have tried to upgrade the graphic card driver, but 
with no impact. Please, did someone solve this?

Thanks,

I?m not sure about the first one, but your problem about X server :0.0 is possibly because the value for your DISPLAY number in your regular terminal doesn?t match your DISPLAY number in X11. I?ll give you some advice based on how it works on a Mac, but your mileage may vary. Open an X11 terminal window (for Mac I do this from the Applications/Utilities folder) and type:

echo $DISPLAY

Check what number is returned. If you?re the second user on the machine to start X11 it?s probably :1.0  so go into your regular terminal window and type

export DISLAY=?:1.0?

To make a more permanent solution you could make such an entry in your .profile or .bash_profile shell login/startup file. You might have to change it each time you restart your machine if your users log in by different order each time you restart (the DISPLAY values are assigned sequentially). You?re probably best off googling this or getting more expert advice specific to your system. But I could try help if you don?t find a clear solution.

Interesting. Chris Rush gave a number of things to look at regarding the X11 issue; as for the "unknown object type" error, could you post a link to some of these scene files you're trying to look at, so I can try to replicate the problem? Also, what version of the NREL installer did you use?

The 'unknown object type' error is caused by reading in a frozen octree (generated with "oconv -f") on an older version of Radiance, before this type was added.  You need to update your copy of Radiance from https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases

Chris has the right advice on X11.

Cheers,

Is there any documentation on how to actually use this material?
So far it is only mentioned in a release note and on some presentation
slides, but not explained at all.
What are eg. useful input values for "specular power"?

Hi Schorsch,

The Ashikhmin-Shirley reflectance model is a kind of anisotropic Phong model made physically plausible.  It's main advantage over the standard anisotropic model in Radiance is that it includes a Fresnel modifier, which I use for perfectly smooth surfaces.  Best to read their original paper:

	www.cs.utah.edu/~shirley/papers/jgtbrdf.pdf

I added this model to Radiance a few years back with help from Nicolas Bonneel, as we were trying to run some comparisons.  Peter Apian-Bennewitz also had requested it, so it seemed worthwhile to add.

Cheers,
-Greg

Very interesting, thanks.

My conclusions go like this:

* The useful range of the exponents seems to be between 0 (fully
   diffuse and 10000 (mirror-like). Between 5 and 100 looks like the
   most interesting range.

* To create a plastic-like appearance, the specular reflection should
   be desaturated.

* For a metallic appearance, the specular and diffuse reflections
   should have a similar tint.

Remaining questions:

* What happens when specular and diffuse colors are vastly different?
   I'm expecting something rather psychedelic... Do actual materials
   like that exist?

* Do the diffuse and specular color values depend on each other?
   Eg. should their sum be less than 1?


Cheers

Yes, unlike the other Radiance materials, you need to consider the sum of specular and diffuse components to determine whether you are within physical limits.  The standard "plastic" and "metal" (likewise "plastic2" and metal2") simply make a binary choice between colored and uncolored highlights.  The "ashik2" type allows you full control.  I don't know what materials this is useful, however.

Cheers,

So does that mean that the right sphere in the slideshow reflects
26% more light on average than the left one?

void plastic2 mat1
4 0 1 0 .
0
6 .3 .7 .5 .26 .1 .02

void ashik2 mat2
4 0 1 0 .
0
8 .3 .7 .5 .26 .26 .26 150 5000

Its hard to tell from the images, but it does appear slightly brighter.

Hmmm...  I guess it reflects about 22% more light, because of the way the specular reflectance reduces the effective diffuse reflectance in plastic2.  The total reflectance is about (1-.26)*.56+.26 for plastic2, and simply 0.56+0.26 for ashik2.

Hi,

Thank you all for help.
I have once again reinstalled radiance (5.0.a.8) - it seems to work now 
- no more ashik2.
Regarding the display/ x11 issue - still working on it - but thanks for 
the hint.

Kind regards,

Paul?na

Hi Prudhvi,

You are correct that changing the luminaire output with ies2rad would be a very inefficient way to go about things.

The best method is to add together illuminance or image results for your separately controllable luminaires using the appropriate dimming factors.  If all of your luminaires are controlled by a single sensor, then this is equivalent to adding a scaled "electric lighting only" component to a "daylight only" component.  This can be accomplished with pcomb like so:

	pcomb -o daylight.hdr -s 0.7 -o electric.hdr > total.hdr

In this example, I assume that your dimming level is set to 70% output.  If you have three separately controlled luminaire banks, your command might look like this:

	pcomb -o daylight.hdr -s 0.25 -o bank1.hdr -s 0.5 -o bank2.hdr -s 0.65 -o bank3.hdr > total.hdr

Here, I have set bank1 to 25%, bank2 to 50%, and bank3 to 65% output.  To compute each of these banks, you will need to render your scene without daylight and with the other banks turned off, somehow.

If you are computing illuminances rather that images, you can use a spreadsheet or similar to apply your dimming factors to the calculated illuminance components in a similar fashion.

If you have individually controlled luminaires, it might be more efficient to use rcontrib to compute the contribution of each luminaire without having to perform multiple rendering calculations.  This is a bit more involved, but you might be able to figure it out from the examples given in my talk from the 2012 Radiance workshop:

	http://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2012-copenhagen/Day1/Ward/Rtcontrib_tut1.pdf

I hope this is enough to get you started.

Best,
-Greg

You will need to use a spreadsheet or custom program to add together illuminance values rather than pcomb, which is for images.  As for computing the dimming levels to achieve the desired illuminance on the work plane, that's a linear optimization problem that shouldn't be too hard to solve using least-squares or similar, but I don't have a ready-made tool to help with that.  Again, Excel or Matlab might be useful for that.

>> Is it possible to simulate such a scenario using radiance. My aim is to find the dimming level when the 500lux is achieved on the work plane.

>> From what I gathered, I can have a multiplication factor in ies2rad. I think this is ineffecient because I will need to generate an octree again. I couldn't find a better alternative.
>> 2. Is there a way to automatically dim the luminaire to meet a certain criteria on illuminance ?

Picking this thread back up on the mailing list to present the solution:

First of all: Please check https://github.com/tbleicher/su2rad/releases for
updates to the su2rad exporter. The current release is 2014.0.0.

The problem is not with su2rad but with DAYSIM and its limited
understanding of the Radiance scene file format. The errors messages

?Cannot find files:

?\radiance\medium

?\radiance\ambfiles\untitled1.amb

?\1)?


show that DAYSIM interprets instructions for 'rad' like AMBFILE etc as
scene files. Some documentation on how to import Radiance files
successfully would be useful.

The way how I managed to do it in the end is this:


   - Open Daysim and create or open a project
   - Use the geometry import option to import **.mat, *.rad, *.sky* files
   - Select the *'materials.rad'* file from the su2rad export folder and
   click the *'Add'* button. (The file will be listed in the box).
   - Select the scene files from the* 'objects'* directory one by one and
   click the *'Add'* button each time.
   - When all files are added to the list, continue with the import. Daysim
   will now convert the materials and geometry.


This will only work if the scene has been exported 'by material' or 'by
layer'. A nested export of SU groups and components will not work. IIRC the
'daysim' option in su2rad was created to provide a 'flat' single file
export option that simplifies the import into Daysim but I have to check
the source again.
