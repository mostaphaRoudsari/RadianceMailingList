Hi Andrei,

This probably belongs on the radiance-general list, since it's not really a code issue.  I am cross-posting there.

There may be something amiss with your Mockup_Lamp_BeamPattern.dat file to brightdata.  How did you create this file, and what values are in it?

I don't know why this would affect the colors, unless there is clipping going on in your rendered images.  This could just be a magnitude issue.

Hello Radiance Experts,

I want to model an LED monitor with a measured beam pattern. Also, I want to superimpose an image on the monitor such that the light projected through the image is affected by the monitor's beam pattern.

I'm running into trouble with my current procedure (INCORRECT IMAGE COLORS -  TOP IMAGE), it produces a monitor image that appears to be color inverted, also the image surface has 0 radiance even though it is applied to a light primitive that has a radiance definition.

See top display image doesn't look like the bottom one, also the top image has no light output: https://s31.postimg.org/8cal8he6j/Monitor_Dif.png

******* INCORRECT IMAGE COLORS -  TOP IMAGE ********

Why is the top definition, using brightdata, produce a color distorted image, that has no luminance? Advice on modelling a monitor will be much appreciated!
I originally posted this on the developer forum but received no replies so I posted this on the general forum.

Thank you for your time,
Andrei Kolomenski

This is really impressive, Mark!  I'll have to try it out next time I have access to a GearVR.  Did you create your own dynamic meshing algorithm?

Mark! That is awesome!

I've been playing around with 360 stereo renderings in Radiance too. I use
google cardboard and created an rcalc command for generating view rays
based on this:
https://developers.google.com/vr/jump/rendering-ods-content.pdf
I was planning to present some of my renderings at the workshop in August.
But your video puts my renderings to shame!

Earlier this week I was looking at image.c to see what it would take to add
native support for equirectangular view types, including both mono and
over-under stereo. I think the awkward part would be specifying the pupil
spacing for stereo renderings. I think we could use the length of the
direction vector for pupil spacing, but this would prevent adding depth of
field blur.

Greg,

The mesh is the set of computational elements for the fluid
simulation, and, yes, a lot of the effort went into creating a dynamic
mesh refinement and re-coalescence algorithm.

Make sure to download the mp4 when you get your hands on a
GearVR---the quality through YouTube leave a lot to be desired, though
it does give some of the feeling of being enveloped by this writing,
grey mesh.

Andy,

I didn't see that document before I took on this project, but I think
my method was pretty similar. If it wasn't, I'm not about to re-render
this one. It'd be great if you shared your method to the list!

Note that the Samsung Internet movie player (for playing YouTube
movies on GearVR) expects your movie data to fill the 16:9 frame,
otherwise it won't map correctly. The Oculus player (for movies
downloaded to your phone+GearVR) is a little smarter, though, and will
play both 3840x1920 (2:1) or 3840x2160 (16:9) just fine.

I'm happy to share, though I think your cal file is more useful to others.
Especially since i didn't comment my script. The main difference between
what I did and the pseudo code in the pdf file linked was that I added
pixel jittering by adding a random number from 0 to 1 to the pixel position.

As for the viewer, I used mobile-vr-station (
https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mobile-vr-station/id959820493?mt=8) on my
iphone with google cardboard viewer and your video worked perfectly. The
mobile-vr-station app itself is a pain in the rear, but I haven't found
anything better for downloading and storing VR images or videos on the
iphone.


here's the script I use:

#! /bin/bash

## Viewpoint Coordinates
vpx=4200
vpy=-1520
vpz=163

## Image Resolution
res=16384

## Octree file
oct=octs/octree.oct
amb=octs/ambient.amb

## Image filename
out=image.hdr

## distance between pupils (for different model units)
# #Inches
#  ipd=2.48031
# #Feet
# ipd=0.206693
# #cm

Subject: [Radiance-general] Gendaymtx and ground
Message-ID: <CA+U776D2PBpdnyxDme3KM8ADTp+BYkd4C03s-6T1f2crmq=UtA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am trying to understand how to use the results from gendaymtx when my
ground is not flat but it is represented by a generic surface.

The first patch generated by gendaymyx is for the ground and it has the
units of W/sr/m2. It has a constant value for each direction below the
horizon.

If I consider a surface dA placed 1 m above the ground (assumed flat for
now) and pointing downwards, I would measure:

g x 2 x Pi [W/m2]

This is assuming that I have used the typical descriptions for the ground
geometry as an hemisphere below the horizon and that there are no
obstructions as these would change the light that is reflected from the
ground.

Is this correct?

If it is, then in order to consider grounds with generic surfaces I should
ignore the first value in gendaymtx and use the actual geometry for the
ground.

Does this make sense?

Thanks

Hi Ruggiero,

If you have ground surfaces in your model (which you should - it's good
practice) you should still use the first value in gendaymtx. The
contribution from your ground surface will be included as reflected light
from sky patches. But, the gap between your ground surface and the horizon
is filled in with the ground patch luminance from gendaymtx. This is
illustrated by figure 7 & 8 in the three phase tutorial (though the advice
is also relevant for daylight coefficient simulations):
http://radiance-online.org/learning/tutorials/Tutorial-ThreePhaseMethod.pdf

Best,
Andy

Hi Andy

I think I got it now. My plane cannot be infinite so I need the first value
in gendaymtx for every ray (pointing towards the lower hemisphere) that
does not intersect the provided ground surface.

Cheers
Ruggiero

Hi,

I am working with Evalglare for my project. Some of the contents of the outputs are not clear, exactly how they meant. I got the following output

Could some one explain

1. difference between E_vert, Edir and if indirect vertical illuminance which is not shown here could be defined as (E_vert- Edir) ?
2. What are Eglare_cie and Lveil_cie? if you could explain in simple terms it would be good.
3. How is the lum_sources calculated? is it area weighted or just the average of luminance sources?
4.difference between Lveil and Lveil_cie?
5. what is band_avlum? every time i get -99 as its value.
6. Why is the last column for each glare source repeated i.e i think its sigma which is repeated? is it on purpose or its a bug?

If you have some documentation which can explain this, that would be very useful.



Thanks & Regards,
Raghu

Since it seems that the attachment was stripped from my original
message, here are the contents of the 3d360.cal file that I used:

{
  3d360.cal

  Definitions for full 360 over-under stereo equirectangular projection

  (c)2014 Mark J. Stock

  Use it like this:
  X=2048; Y=2048; cnt $Y $X | rcalc -f 3d360.cal -e
"XD=$X;YD=$Y;X=0;Y=0;Z=-0.1;IPD=0.06;EX=0;EZ=0" | rtrace [rpict
options] -x $X -y $Y -fac scene.oct > out.hdr

  Parameters defined externally:
  X : neck rotation origin x
  Y : neck rotation origin y
  Z : neck rotation origin z
  XD : horizontal picture dimension ( pixels )
  YD : vertical picture dimension ( pixels )
  IPD : inter-pupillary distance
       this is between 0.055m and 0.07m on most humans
  These don't seem to work all that well:
  EX : forward distance between neck rotation center and bridge of
nose (between eyes)
       this is between 0.05m and 0.07m on most humans
  EZ : vertical distance between neck rotation center and eye
elevation when altitude is 0 degrees
       this is around 0.1m on most humans
}

{ Direction of the current pixel (both angles in radians) }
px = $2;
py = YD - $1;
frac(x) : x - floor(x);
altitude = (frac((py-0.5)/(YD/2)) - 0.5) * PI;
{ to do over-under stereo, azimuth is easy }
azimut = px * 2 * PI / XD;

{ Transformation into a direction vector }
xdir = cos(azimut) * cos(altitude);
ydir = sin(azimut) * cos(altitude);
zdir = sin(altitude);

{ Transform the viewpoint to account for the eye position }
dx = EX;
dy = if($1 - YD/2, 0.5*IPD, -0.5*IPD);
dz = EZ;
xpos = X + xdir*dx - sin(azimut)*dy + cos(azimut)*zdir*dz;
ypos = Y + ydir*dx + cos(azimut)*dy + sin(azimut)*zdir*dz;
zpos = Z - zdir*dx +           0*dy + cos(altitude)   *dz;

{ Output line to rtrace; each ray needs: xorg yorg zorg xdir ydir zdir }
$1 = xpos; $2 = ypos; $3 = zpos;
$4 = xdir; $5 = ydir; $6 = zdir;

{ EOF }

Note that the above will generate a 1:1 ratio final image, with left
on the top half and right on the bottom. To knock that down to 16:9
for Youtube, I used the following mencoder command:

mencoder "mf://@allframes.txt" -mf w=3840:h=3840:type=png:fps=30 -o

Hi  Raghu,

the answers in detail below.
There will be released a new version soon (before the radiance workshop) 
with plenty new features (masking, zones, other indexes) and also a huge 
speed increase.
I have already tested the new version on more than 1000 different images 
and it is reproducing the data to 100% with an average speed improvement 
of factor 15 (for the images I have).
To extend the test I'm looking for approx. 5 volunteers doing some 
beta-testing with the new version in the next weeks. Operating systems 
for the test are Mac or Linux preferably.
If someone is interested in this new version, please send me a message.

E_vert is the Illuminance calculated from the image (usually vertical 
illuminance)
E_dir is the illuminance just by the detected glare sources (needed for 
the CIE glare index)

these are disability glare values, for details read the documents on 
disability glare from the CIE

It is the average luminance of all glare sources, weighted by the solid 
angle   equation: 
Lum_sources=(L1*omega_1+L2*omega_2+...Ln*omega_n)/(omega_1+omega_2+...omega_n) 

> 4.difference between *Lveil* and *Lveil_cie*?
Lveil is the disability glare according to Pointer. Lveil_cie according 
to CIE.
> 5. what is *band_avlum*? every time i get -99 as its value.
you should read the manual page;-) , it is explained there as well. If 
you define a horizontal band, then you get the average luminance in that 
horizontal band calculated. If you dont activate the option, you get 
-99. The new upcoming version will have a separate output section for 
the band evaluation, showing more data within the band. So the last-line 
output for the band (and the -99 for non-activation) will disappear.

some values are the same for each glare source, some of them differ. 
That's why. Sigma is an angle needed to calculate the position index.
The actual official version, distributed from the Radiance-web-site, is 
bug-free as far as I know. A nasty output will be created, when no glare 
source is found (some results are nan or -inf). this is fixed for the 
upcoming version.

Hi Jan,

Thank you very much, that clears most of the questions. Rest I will go through the sources you mentioned. In the next 2-3 weeks i will be extensively working with Evalglare for my new project, if you could share the new version i could test as well as it would help me, And I could report  bugs if any. 

Best Regards,
Raghu

Subject: [Radiance-general] Annual simulation with electrochromic glass
Message-ID: <CD24FBB6-2ECC-4336-89BE-7F9B99D5A330@estia.ch>

Hi, 

I would like to achieve annual simulation of an electrochromic glass (tint change) with Radiance to obtain room illumination. 

I am interested in the 3 phases method, but the glass xml file defines a constant behavior for each hour of the year.

Is it possible to create a file containing the evolutionary behavior of glass every hour?
Or is there another way to simulate this kind of glass (other than one simulation per hour)?

Thanks in advance,
Best regards,

Julien

Julien,

A while ago I saw THESE SLIDES
<https://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2014-london/presentations/day2/Mardaljevic-Electrochromic.pdf/view>by
John Mardaljevic... maybe they can help you.

On the other hand, the method I would choose for simulating electrochromic
glass would be using Daylight Coefficients. It may take longer (depending
on the number of windows and states you want to simulate), but it will
consider the true specularity of the glass (BSDFs used in the 3-phase
method will not allow that).

What I often do is to perform a DC simulation for every state of the office
(I usually work with simple offices with a small amount of windows), and
then use a script or spreadsheet to select what is the state at each hour.
The calculation of the state of the window at each hour will depend on the
control strategy...

I hope this helps

Hi Jan,

In one of my simulations, I got Max_Lum as 8047776.5. I expected  Max_Lum to be maximum of the luminance of all the pixels in the image, on a brightest sunny it could be 120000 lux, but how is this value higher than the later? Let me know if this variable  means some thing different. I am using version 1.17

From Yesterdays questions, What does Indirect vertical Illuminance  mean(Is this the effect of Background Luminance)? does this satisfy the equation E_vert=E_dir+E_indir ? where E_indir is Indirect vertical Illuminance.

I could find some docs which explains Lveil_cie but i am not clear. What does its value signifies? Similarly with Eglare_cie


Thanks & Regards,

Just to clarify a bit (hopefully), what German means is that by simulating the glass *as glass*, and tracing rays through an actual glass material to the sky, you will get better results than if you use a BSDF, in the case of a specular transmitter like clear glazing. The standard Klems resolution for the BSDF (and this is what you have available if you use the standard Radiance tools for annual daylight coefficient simulations) will "smear" the spiky direct solar contributions into a single patch subtending 17 degrees, or worse, take that radiation and spread it among three Klems patches. By doing a separate annual daylight coefficient simulation for each tint state of your EC glazing, you can then mix and match the hourly values. As German said, this is what he does with his tools, and this is also what we do with OpenStudio for EC glazing simulations.

Julien,

A while ago I saw THESE SLIDES <https://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2014-london/presentations/day2/Mardaljevic-Electrochromic.pdf/view> by John Mardaljevic... maybe they can help you.

On the other hand, the method I would choose for simulating electrochromic glass would be using Daylight Coefficients. It may take longer (depending on the number of windows and states you want to simulate), but it will consider the true specularity of the glass (BSDFs used in the 3-phase method will not allow that).

What I often do is to perform a DC simulation for every state of the office (I usually work with simple offices with a small amount of windows), and then use a script or spreadsheet to select what is the state at each hour. The calculation of the state of the window at each hour will depend on the control strategy...

I hope this helps

Hi,

I would like to achieve annual simulation of an electrochromic glass (tint change) with Radiance to obtain room illumination.

I am interested in the 3 phases method, but the glass xml file defines a constant behavior for each hour of the year.

Is it possible to create a file containing the evolutionary behavior of glass every hour?
Or is there another way to simulate this kind of glass (other than one simulation per hour)?

Thanks in advance,
Best regards,

Julien

Hi Julien,

You can simulate an estimate of electrochromic glass performance fairly
easily with SPOT Pro <http://www.daylightinginnovations.com/spot-home>.  It
is a work-around and performance estimate but does not have the limitations
(smearing that Rob mentioned) that a daylight cofficient approach might
have with a specular product.  You can also control the electrochromic via
an actual exterior photosensor signal or using advanced manual control
algorithms.

In SPOT to simulate electrochromic glazing, you just apply a "multiplier"
glazing as the window treatment.  Your base window might have the ~58%
transmittance of a clear state.  Then, say, the most tinted state is ~1%,
you can define a 1.7% transmittance glass and apply as the window
treatment.  This is not the most accurate way to model in Radiance as it
introduces another uneccesary surface and reflectance interactions but
should work well enough for annual space performance analysis.  This only
models the top and bottom tint state, but I think it comes pretty close to
simulating annual performance as I am not sure how often in between states
are even used.  As a designer or an occupant, I would want to have the
darkest tint if I was under direct sunlight and the clearest tint
otherwise.  They exist, but there are limited hours where there is no
direct sunlight but the clouds/sky are just too bright.  SPOT would not
capture these 2nd and 3rd state conditions.

A more accurate generic electrochromic model is in the works and will be
included in an upcoming SPOT release.

Cheers,
Zack

Hi Mark,

this is absolutely fascinating, thank you very much for joining the video and also your procedure.

?

I just tested it with a current project (no video just a rendering) and it is amazing.

?

One thing that came up. My rendering seems to be mirrored about the vertical axes. That means left and right is switched. Pflip does the job, no problem. But I am just curious, maybe I did something wrong.

?

This is my command:

cnt 3000 3000 | rcalc -f 3d360.cal -e "XD=3000;YD=3000;X=62.854;Y=29.687;Z=7.1;IPD=0.02;EX=0;EZ=0" | rtrace -ab 3 -x 3000 -y 3000 -n 12 -af pano_ambs_ol -fac T1_ol.oct > Pano1_ol.hdr

?

X, Y an Z is the Position of the Head. And I did not change anything in the 3d360.cal

?

On the iPhone I use the Mobile VR Station and there I use the 3D Spherical Top/Bottom Playback Type.

?

Many thanks and best regards

Martin Klingler

You need to share the material specification that is generating your error.  Most likely, the function file is missing (or not needed).  In this case, you should give a single period ('.') in place of the function file name.

I just realized that the ashik2 type never got into the Radiance reference manual, which is something I will remedy for the next release.

Cheers,

Message-ID: <CAOn=hKEQakoJgOZSPrFKE++1GotFYBAQBAkLoM4M1pPZuFt4Og@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,


I am trying to install the BSDFViewer on a Lubuntu 64bit virutal machine in
VMWare. I have installed all the packages necessary for the compilation,
and making some changes in the install.sh, as suggested in this previous
post
http://radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-February/010784.html,
I was able to compile and run the viewer. However, I still have a problem
with the visualization of BSDF with tensor tree resolution; please have a
look there https://www.dropbox.com/s/byi4gsdkuknoi5l/tensortree.png?dl=0 ,
the values of transmission are wrong.

On the other hand, the Klems visualization works fine.


Any help or advice would be apriciated.

Best,
*Giuseppe *

Hello!
I can't run Radiance on my computer. I must be doing something wrong...
This is the link where I downloaded it:
https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases
I have tried with this: *radiance-5.0.0-win64.exe*
<https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/download/5.0/radiance-5.0.0-win64.exe>
It seems like I install it normally but then I just can't find the acces to
the program.
When I ask fot the desktop acces it installs an acces to Autocad.
Is that ok??

Thank you

Hi Violetta,

There is no "Radiance.exe"; there is no manageable way to provide desktop icons for all the Radiance tools. They are intended to be called from the command line interface (CLI). The whole process of getting a Radiance model to produce meaningful results is very tunable, and relies heavily on the unix "toolbox" model, where you pass in some stuff on one program, and take the output of that program and send it to another one in the tool chain. It's wholly different from double clicking on an icon and accessing menus, and in my opinion, it's way more fun.

The NREL Windows installer places all the Radiance programs wherever you ask it to. Normally, this is in "C:\ProgramFiles\Radiance\bin", or something similar. You need to add this location to your system PATH, and also the "C:\ProgramFiles\Radiance\lib" directory to an environment variable called "RAYPATH".  There are other posts on this list and on the internet(s) that describe how to set these environment variables, if you are not familiar. Once these things are done, you would call the tools you need directly from the CLI, e.g.:

oconv.exe my_model.rad > my_model.oct
rcontrib.exe [options] my_model.oct | etc...

Hi Violeta,

Unfortunately, the command-line tools in Radiance are difficult to use if you are not used to them.  I am not sure what options Axel Jacobs uses for WebHDR, but you can try the following:

falsecolor -s auto -i input.hdr | ra_tiff - falsec.tif

This will result in a linear luminance scale.  If you want a log scale with 1000:1 range (10^3:1), use:

falsecolor -log 3 -s auto -i input.hdr | ra_tiff - falsecl.tif

If you have a Mac, you can download Photosphere, which has a more familiar application GUI from:

http://www.anyhere.com/

Best,
-Greg

Hi.
I've been using the R-Y-O demo (http://www.jaloxa.eu/webhdr/demo.shtml) to get luminance false color images, but it says that the program is currently down.
I know there is a way to get those images from Radiance. I?ve been looking through the documentation posted on the web site but its been really difficult for me to understand.
I was wondering if there's an easier way to do it, since it was really easy to do it on R-Y-O.

Thank you very much

Dear Radiance Community,

Please consider submitting an abstract to Building Simulation 2017- the biennial conference of the International Building Performance Simulation Association (IBPSA). The conference will be held in San Francisco from August 7-9, 2017. This is the first time it has been held in the US since 1995.

Abstracts for peer-reviewed papers are due August 10th, 2016. Oral presentations without papers will be solicited later in 2016.

IBPSA is encouraging submissions from all areas of building performance, including but not limited to: lighting, daylighting, acoustics, HVAC, CFD, controls, policy, and BIM. More information about the conference can be found on http://www.buildingsimulation2017.org/

Many Thanks!

Hi Giuseppe,

I've had mixed feedback with the linux version of BSDFViewer. And since I
don't have the hardware of knowledge, I can't debug and fix whatever is
causing mixed results. I'm sorry, but I don't think I can offer any help
beyond what has already been posted. It seems like your libraries installed
properly and something is going wrong after the values are returned for the
BSDF query.

For this reason I'm planning to remove support for tensor tree in the Linux
version when I get around to the next update. Tensor Tree support may be a
Mac only feature in upcoming releases.

Best,
Andy

Hi Andy and Randolph,



Thank you for the answers. Randolph, I really appreciate your support.
Before to throw the towel, I would like to try your installation and linux
version.



Cheers,

Giuseppe

Message-ID: <1B23446CBF250648A2FC775DE3FE7E80FF442CD2@OC11expo28.exchange.mit.edu>

Dear RADIANCE community,



We are pleased to announce that the registration<http://diva4rhino.com/diva-day-2016> for DIVA Day 2016 is now open. DIVA Days is an annual symposium to discuss the use of DIVA and associated environmental analysis tools in design practice, research and architectural education. Previous events were in 2015<http://diva4rhino.com/diva-day-2015> at the Architecture Association, 2014<http://diva4rhino.com/diva-day-2014> in Seattle, 2013<http://diva4rhino.com/diva-day-2013> at Thornton Tomasetti's offices in New York and 2012<http://diva4rhino.com/diva-day-2012> at MIT. DIVA Day 2016 will be hosted by the John H. Daniels Faculty of Architecture, Landscape and Design at the University of Toronto on Friday, September 30.



In addition to the symposium, we will be offering a full day of DIVA training<http://www.eventbee.com/v/diva-day-toronto> on September 29. Classes will range from the basics of daylighting modeling in Rhino to more advanced parametric modeling in Grasshopper using DIVA 4.0.



As in previous years, we are organizing a student competition<http://diva4rhino.com/diva-day-2016/student-competition> with the winning team having the opportunity to present at DIVA Day. This year's prize money will be $US 1500.



We are looking forward to welcoming some of you at these events,

The Solemmas

Dear Radiance users:
I ran into a rendering error and hope someone can help me out.
I want to explain my procedure first. My apologies if this message is much
too long ...
I built the model in DIVA and exported the model into .obj.
Then I used obj2rad to convert the model and created the material file
accordingly.
After that, I used oconv to create the .oct file and used rvu for
rendering.
Meanwhile, for the sky model, I tried several examples from Rendering with
Radiance, for instance $gensky 7 1 12 +i -a 37.97 -o -23.50 -m -30.
However, the results don't look right. The results only show direct
sunlight without diffuse light, I speculate that there is something wrong
with my model that influences the sky model. I am sharing my model,
material, and view files below.
Please help me to solve the issue.
As always, thak you all.

Hi

Apparently the sky vault is missing in the sky.rad file.
You just need to add the following lines:

skyfunc glow sky_glow
0
0
4 0 0 1 180

And be sure that you use the parameter -ab to set the number of ambient bounces if you're running commands yourself. The sky vault source that Raphael mentions is only considered in the ambient calculation. Higher values for -ab (within the range of usually 2 to 6 or maybe more) increases accuracy wherever reflections between surfaces are important.

Hi

Apparently the sky vault is missing in the sky.rad file.
You just need to add the following lines:

skyfunc glow sky_glow
0
0
4 0 0 1 180

Rapha?l

However, the results don't look right. The results only show direct sunlight without diffuse light, I speculate that there is something wrong with my model that influences the sky model. I am sharing my model, material, and view files below.

Hello Raphael:
Thank you for your solution. I added the sky vault and it works now.
Again I really appreciate your quick reply.

Hello Christopher:
Thank you for your reminder. I will add -ab in rvu from now on.

SimAUD2017 ? Call for Submissions  [ http://simaud.com/2017/call_for_submissions.php ]

To respond to the increasing complexity of cities and buildings, computer simulations for the built environment are not only required to support both specific disciplinary expertise and interdisciplinary collaborations, but also address all scales of the built environment, from exploring new urban configurations to the design of building components. Consequently, innovation in computer simulations questions disciplinary boundaries and derives from the convergence of knowledge from different fields. The 8th annual Symposium on Simulation for Architecture and Urban Design (SimAUD) tackles the interdisciplinary aspects of the development and use of simulations to measure, predict, assess, comprehend and manage the performances of buildings and cities, in regard to their technical and non-technical requirements. SimAUD offers the opportunity to present innovative simulation methods and techniques and to discuss their roles in urban planning, architecture, engineering, construction, and management. This year's event will be held at the MaRS Discovery District and at the University of Toronto in Canada, in the heart of one of the largest urban innovation hubs.

In past years, attendees have included researchers and practitioners in the fields of urban planning and design, architecture and building science, visualization and construction, as well as software developers, managers, educators, and business professionals. Past SimAUD symposia have attracted exceptionally high-quality submissions (papers, notes, works in progress, datasets, and videos). We highly encourage you to take advantage of the free downloads of previous years' proceedings<http://simaud.org/proceedings/>.

We invite you to submit and present an original contribution for SimAUD2017. All submissions are peer-reviewed and considered for selection by the Scientific Committee. All accepted full papers (8 pages) will be published in the ACM Digital Library<http://portal.acm.org/dl.cfm>. However, all the accepted submissions (both full and short papers) will be published in SimAUD?s proceedings. Please observe the submission types and deadlines on the Symposium website. SimAUD is run collaboratively with ACM/SIGSIM<http://www.sigsim.org/> and is sponsored by The Society for Modeling and Simulation International<http://www.scs.org/>.
