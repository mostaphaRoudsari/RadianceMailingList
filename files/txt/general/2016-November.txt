Subject: [Radiance-general] Radiance-general] Radiance-general] rpict
 command for photon mapping
Message-ID: <c5ruxd1pgcgymtvjjvhpm7lp.1477990933062@email.android.com>

Hi Katsuya,

Check the output of getinfo on the photon map. Check the extent (bounding box) to see the photons are where you expect them to be in your scene. Also check the flux in Watts for an absurdly low or high value.

Hi Roland,

Thank you for your advice.
I tried getinfo and got following result.
global.pmap:
        #?RADIANCE
        mkpmap -apg global.pmap 50000 -t 60 model.oct
        43666 photons @ (1.55e+000, 1.38e+000, 1.17e+000) avg watts
        Extent [2356.115, -840.531, 5.277] [2429.861, -780.744, 120.050]
        FORMAT=Radiance_Global_Photon_Map
        VERSION=160

But I am not sure whether this value is reasonable or not. Can you give me any thought on this value?

Regards,
Katsuya

Hi Greg,

I have tried regenerating octree and run rpict again as following command.

mkpmap -apg global.pmap 50000 -t 60 model.oct
I could run successfully until mkpmap and got global.pmap. But when I tried to run rpict as following, I get test.txt file just repeating following command.
rpict -t 60 -ap global.pmap 50 -ab -1 -vf view.vf model.oct >> test.txt

Are there any way to confirm whether calculated photon map file( in this case global.pmap) is correct or not?

Hi all,

Indeed intriguing. But how did Katsuya get mkpmap to generate a photon map in the first place? It uses the standard octree parsing routines.

Yes, there must be something wrong with the rpict command on your system.  Try running "rpict -version" and "rpict -defaults" with no other options.

If those don't return, then rpict is completely broken on your system.  Perhaps it is a 64/32-bit mode issue.  I have no idea.

Hi Greg,

I even don?t get ?0% done?.
Followings are the result when I tested your suggestion.
1.What happens when you run the same command without the photon maps?
I tried rpict ?t 60 ?ab 1 ?vf view.vf model.oct >test.result. Even in this case, I couldn?t get ?0% done?.
2. What happens when you run with the photon maps and -ab -1?
I tried rpict -t 60 -ap global.pmap 50 -ab -1 -vf view.vf model.oct >test.result. Also in this case, I couldn?t get ?0% done?.

Does this mean that I have problem in rpict command not in photon maps?

Thank you for your help.
Regards,
Katsuya

Hi Katsuya,

With the -t 60 option, you should at least get a "0% done" message after initialization.  Is that message even showing up?  You might not see reports every 60 seconds if the scanline writes take longer than that, but you should at least get the initialization output.  If you are not seeing that, then something else must be wrong with your command, or the photon map(s) are not loading correctly.  I don't know how to verify this, other than regenerating the maps and trying again.

What happens when you run the same command without the photon maps?  What happens when you run with the photon maps and -ab -1?

Does anyone else have experience/suggestions to offer?

Cheers,
-Greg

Hi Greg,

Thank you for your reply.
Below is the command I tried to run for rpict.
rpict -t 60 -ap global.pmap 50 -ap caustic 200 -ab 1 -vf view.vf model.oct

Following your advice, I changed the command to add output redirection as below.
rpict -t 60 -ap global.pmap 50 -ap caustic 200 -ab 1 -vf view.vf model.oct >test.result

It seems that I could run command but it does not report any progress. Are there any specific format I should specify for output file?

Thank you!
Regards,
Katsuya

Can you offer any details about what process is starting all the (unsuccessful?) rpict commands?  It seems that there is no output redirection, so this is not even a command you would normally run.  What is running it for you?

Best,
-Greg

Hi all,

I am trying to create rendering image using photon map.
Following the photon map extension user manual, I could run mkpmap command.
But when I try to run rpict command, it seems that they keep trying to run the command and failing as following image.
Can anyone advise me what is causing this problem and how to solve it.
Thank you very much for your help!

Hi Katsuya,

I am still not sure exactly what you are doing when you get this error.  What is the test.txt file, if not one you created using the rpict command?  Why are you outputting an image to a ".txt" file?  What actually command are you running on the command-line?  Or, if it is some other program/script running rpict, can you share that script with us?  The circumstances of this error are very important if you want others' help debugging it.

Cheers,
-Greg

I have not seen this problem before.  Usually, if there is a problem with the octree, it will report an error an exit.  How was the octree generated?  Did you try re-generating it and running rpict again?

Hi Greg and Jon,
This is an indirectly lit surface (a ceiling).  I am not seeing the same
patterning I get with -aa >0.  In a small test scene, I see the normal
pertubation if I apply a specularity to the material, but not if it is
purely diffuse, images below are with a diffuse material.  In longer runs
that clean up the noise I see the same lack of pattern:

vwrays -ff -vf 1.vf -x 400 -y 400 | rtrace  `vwrays -d -vf 1.vf -x 400 -y

Hi Stephen,

I only now realize that I misread your initial post, thinking you were talking about the -ab setting rather than -aa.  Mea culpa.

Are you sure the texture isn't just being masked by all the noise you get with -aa 0?  Is it indeed a texture rather than a pattern you have applied?  In either case, it should have some effect whatever your -aa setting.  If you increase the -ad setting and decrease the -lw setting to 1/(ad) accordingly, the noise should go down to where you may be able to discern the texture again.  Can you share what texture you are using, exactly?

Cheers,
-Greg

Hi Greg,

here is my cal file to simulate metal decking:

{
A1 = length of 1 period
A2 = angle of ribs (0-90)
A3 = bottom length
A4 = top length
}
angle = A2*DEGREE;

F1 = A3/A1;
F2 = (A1-A3-A4)/2/A1 + F1;
F3 = A4/A1 + F2;
inc = frac(Px/A1);
zcor = if(and(inc-F1,F2-inc),cos(-angle),if(inc-F3,cos(angle),0));
xcor = if(and(inc-F1,F2-inc),sin(-angle),if(inc-F3,sin(angle),0));
ycor = 0;

and here is the material I am applying:

void texfunc NS
6 xcor ycor zcor ./decking.cal -rz 14
0
4 .667 71.5673 .1808 .3186

NS plastic NSdeck
0
0
5 .8 .8 .8 0 0

here is the same scene with the geometry physically modeled, the pattern is
more prominent because of self shading, but I would expect to see something
like this because of the normal perturbation (even with the noise).

and here is the scene run with higher settings (-ad 20000) to reduce the
noise (still no discernible texture):

Hi Stephen,

Perfect -- thanks for the additional explanation and renderings.  Now I know what's happening, which I should have known had I only remembered the age-old limitation built into the indirect calculation from the beginning.

The basic problem is that the perturbed normal cannot be used to assign the sampling hemisphere, because this would inevitably lead to sampling behind the surface, which would introduce nasty light leaks in many situations.  This is one of the main problems with "bump mapping" as it is commonly referred to in graphics, and Radiance adds some special tests in the specular material sampling routines to avoid generating rays that penetrate an opaque surface.  Modeling the object as actually geometry avoids this problem, and is really the best way to get an accurate result if you don't mind all the extra polygons....

The trick I employ when using the ambient cache is to take the calculated "rotational gradient" and apply it using the perturbed surface normal to simulate the cosine effect you get with a different surface orientation.  Thus, the hemispherical ray samples are generated based on the unperturbed normal, but the perturbed normal is used to adjust the final value.

This trick doesn't happen with -aa 0, because I don't bother to calculate the rotational gradient, figuring that I'm not caching any values so I won't need it.  However, I *could* calculate it in cases where there is a normal perturbation, and use it in the same way I do with the irradiance cache on.  I don't think it would be that much trouble to add this capability after looking again at the code, so I might send you a version to try a little later today.

Cheers,
-Greg

Hi all,



How can I render Reinhart MF:4 sky for a given location, date and time using command prompt in Windows?


Thanks
Best regardsSandeep

Hi Sandeep,

Did you include the falsecolor rendering so as to say, "I'd like to render something like this?"  Otherwise, it looks like you already figured it out.  Where did you get the image?

If you want to render a hemispherical fisheye projection but not in false color, you can use the following command to create a set of component images:

	vwrays -vth -vp 0 0 0 -vd 0 0 1 -vu 0 1 0 -vh 180 -vv 180 -x 512 -y 512 | rfluxmtx -fac -x 512 -y 512 - rh4sky.rad

where "rh4sky.rad" contains:

###############
#@rfluxmtx h=u o=rhsky%04d.hdr

void glow groundglow
0
0
4 1 1 1 0

groundglow source ground
0
0
4 0 0 -1 180

# Sky glow inherits previous o= setting
#@rfluxmtx h=r4 u=+Y

void glow skyglow
0
0
4 1 1 1 0

skyglow source sky
0
0
4 0 0 1 180

###############

This will create 2306 uncompressed picture files in the current working directory.  On some machines, you need to increase the number of open files allowed.  Honestly, I don't know how to do this under Windows or if it's a problem.

If you prefer an angular fisheye, which would include visibility of the ground in the corners, change "-vth" to "-vta" in the vwrays command.

To generate a particular sky, use genskyvec with dctimestep like so:

	gensky 11 2 12:30 [meridian, latitude, etc.] | genskyvec -m 4 | dctimestep rhsky%04d.hdr > sky11_2_1230.hdr

If you then want to convert this to a false color representation, you can use:

	falsecolor -i sky11_2_1230.hdr -log 5 -s auto | ra_bmp > sky11_2_1230fc.bmp

I just want to add that using rfluxmtx to generate 2306 uncompressed pictures, each of which has just a few white pixels, is pretty wasteful of CPU time and disk space.  You can run each of the images through "ra_rgbe -r" to reduce their size, but the calculation is still pretty bad.  There are better ways to do it, but none that are very convenient.

I should also mention that there was a bug that was recently fixed related to the numbering of output pictures in rcontrib, so you will need to have the latest HEAD release for all this to work.

Cheers,
-Greg

Hi Katsuya,

Without knowing your input, it seems reasonable. The photon seems a bit high for a realistic scene maybe.

Subject: [Radiance-general] genBSDF and Klems output
Message-ID: <0B3ECCD9-1BB1-4AFD-BD48-1C3E68AFCAF2@gmail.com>

Dear Advanced Users,

If you have been applying genBSDF to create Klems files using any of the HEAD releases since March 2015, including the latest official release (5.0), then your XML files may contain significant inaccuracies.  David Geisler-Moroder and Christian Knoflach discovered an issue with the solid angle correction in genBSDF (actually in wrapBSDF) that was introduced back in spring of 2015.

This issue has been corrected in the latest HEAD, but we have not made an official release yet with the updated version.  If you are relying on genBSDF or any XML files generated by it with the Klems distribution, you should probably regenerate them using the latest HEAD version.

This problem does not affect tensor tree XML files generated by genBSDF, nor Klems files created using bsdf2klems.

Best,
-Greg

Message-ID: <SG2PR01MB15948898EDBBBC99035E6486FBA00@SG2PR01MB1594.apcprd01.prod.exchangelabs.com>

Dear All,

I am looking for a method to investigate external glare from building facades using forward ray tracing to predict critical locations and then quantifying reflected daylight received at the critical positions with a backward ray tracing time-series simulation (reference paper attached - Yang et al. 2013, Simulation of Reflected Daylight From Building Envelopes). I have been using DIVA for Rhino/Grasshopper  but as far as I'm aware this is incapable of forward ray tracing to predict critical locations. Also as I am interested in reflected light primarily from the building being investigated at the locations of interest (rail corridor),  any glare studies I run at these locations do not provide the results I am after. As light direct from the sun is included in the results.

I'd appreciate any help in advice or in directing me to applicable Radiance docs.

I'm new to Radiance but have programming experience.


Thanks,

Tom

Message-ID: <AAD4C5B99DCE7E4EA05016103A8F236B2E0E38@E-AEXMBX10.global.arup.com>

Hi all,

When I was following the tutorial "The Three-Phase Method for Simulating Complex Fenestration with Radiance", I could not run the command "gensky 1 12 11|genskyvec -m 1>skyvec_1-21-11_1.skv"(p3) because there is no genskyvec.exe file in my Radiance/bin folder.
Instead of genskyvec.exe, I found genskyvec.pl. Additionally, I found some command is in perl formal, not in exe format.
Can anyone tell me why some command is writtern by perl file?
And also are there any document how I can use these perl file through command prompt?(ex. What is the argument etc)

Thank you.
Regards,
Katsuya

There are a few Radiance programs that are not compiled C code but rather
are interpreted programs, generally written in Perl (but a few
csh dinosaurs remain). In order to use them, you need to have Perl
installed, and properly configured. Once this is complete, that
perl program will execute just the same as any regular Radiance executable.
The man page for genskyvec is here:

Hi Katsuya,

You can find Windows exe files of all the Radiance Perl scripts on my web site:
http://www.jaloxa.eu/resources/radiance/radwinexe.shtml

just drop the exe files into the Radiance bin folder.

Kind regards

Axel

Hi Axel,

Thank you for your reply.
You are doing so great work!
Following your instruction, I could run all the exe file except for genskyvec.exe.
When I tried to run genskyvec, I get following error message.
"The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process."
Do you have any idea what is causing this error?

Thank you.
Regards,
Katsuya

Hi Katsuya,

I've never seen this error message, but it sounds like some Windows
file locking thing.  Do you have the file you're trying to process
open in a text editor?

Cheers

Axel

Hi Axel, Greg, Katsuya,

I get the same error on Windows when using dctimestep. Here's a sample
output:

cannot access the file because it is being used by another process.

Note that for the perl scripts, I'm referencing them from my clone of the
NREL git repo, so they should be up to date.

I'm not sure if the messages indicate that anything bad has happened, as
dctimestep is still generating output.

Hi Katsuya,

I suggest to follow the advice from Rob. I usually run the 3-phase method
on Windows OS using the last Radiance release (5.x.x) and it works fine
with the perl program. Just install the perl interpreter (I use this one
<http://strawberryperl.com/>) and run the command for genskyvec with the
.pl extention, like:
gensky 1 12 11|genskyvec.pl ?m 1>skyvec_1-21-11_1.skv

best,
Giuseppe

Hi Giuseppe,

Well, I am using Strawberry perl (I've also tried other perl interpreters),
and I am using the latest Radiance release (5.0.a.12), and I am still
having this issue.

Message-ID: <CAHH+Y=o018qcNa2FdvbG7Ys7R2yabidVsP4Ar7v=sxRzm3ZMdg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Greg and Radiance List,
Concerning the genBSDF inaccuracies, for windows OS is genBSDF.exe
similarly affected? How about any XML files generated using Window7.4 (I
assume only if the shading layer was made with post Mar2015 genBSDF)? Is
there any plan to update the NREL Radiance win64 release with a corrected
genBSDF.exe?
Best,
Brandon

Yes, this affects the Windows version of genBSDF (actually wrapBSDF, which it calls) as well.  I don't believe there has been an update to the Windows installers since the fix, which went in mid-October.  We were hoping to make a new 5.1 release, but have been delayed by some fixes we need to make to the photon-mapping code.  Roland is recovering from surgery.  Please take the opportunity to wish him well!

Cheers,
-Greg

Hi Giuseppe,

Well, I am using Strawberry perl (I've also tried other perl interpreters), and I am using the latest Radiance release (5.0.a.12), and I am still having this issue.

Hi Katsuya,

I suggest to follow the advice from Rob. I usually run the 3-phase method on Windows OS using the last Radiance release (5.x.x) and it works fine with the perl program. Just install the perl interpreter (I use this one<http://strawberryperl.com/>) and run the command for genskyvec with the .pl extention, like:
gensky 1 12 11|genskyvec.pl<http://secure-web.cisco.com/11h2b4hjqlKVj0HetF9cYfs-QdQKgcshHvH_IXss6JZX33B9gmeErbc-TZuqCuEMLfpFNCa3y_pUfx5yBvFE8Lpy990aQsAzFEptiWY8p2Ik0V7heu3eNFLYD5jHE_YtSCT1PyGvlapRMNNo8NU9oyxZMDI4iSHd5Yt0eV9TLBGFnpnqKE6kaKAm1CAhQXn2F8DSgAGxeWGJwpye-ryNnBqWFYwkNHXaKYoeuMbBkpd4/http%3A%2F%2Fgenskyvec.pl> ?m 1>skyvec_1-21-11_1.skv

Hi Axel,

Thank you for your reply.
You are doing so great work!
Following your instruction, I could run all the exe file except for genskyvec.exe.
When I tried to run genskyvec, I get following error message.
"The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process."
Do you have any idea what is causing this error?

Thank you.

Hi Katsuya,

You can find Windows exe files of all the Radiance Perl scripts on my web site:
http://www.jaloxa.eu/resources/radiance/radwinexe.shtml

just drop the exe files into the Radiance bin folder.

Kind regards

Yeah, the latest Windows Radiance installer we have posted at github/NREL was created on Oct 3 -- about ten days ahead of that fix, unfortunately. I'm not super motivated to release another installer until the photon map stuff is all working again on the Windows side.

In the meantime I'm taking this opportunity to publicly wish Roland well as we recovers from surgery! Come on back, mon!

Yes, this affects the Windows version of genBSDF (actually wrapBSDF, which it calls) as well.  I don't believe there has been an update to the Windows installers since the fix, which went in mid-October.  We were hoping to make a new 5.1 release, but have been delayed by some fixes we need to make to the photon-mapping code.  Roland is recovering from surgery.  Please take the opportunity to wish him well!

Hi Greg and Radiance List,
Concerning the genBSDF inaccuracies, for windows OS is genBSDF.exe similarly affected? How about any XML files generated using Window7.4 (I assume only if the shading layer was made with post Mar2015 genBSDF)? Is there any plan to update the NREL Radiance win64 release with a corrected genBSDF.exe?
Best,
Brandon

University of Technology and Design (SUTD) who is the main developer of
DIVA for Rhino and has done extensive studies on daylight and glare,
especially the impact of glare generated by the reflection of solar panels
near airport to the airplane flight path, if I recall correctly. - Ji

Hello Tom,

Since I've been mentioned by name, I thought I'd reply :). As far as I 
know, no GUI is perfect for your study right now, but since you are 
using DIVA, here are some thoughts about how you could proceed.

  * DIVA does have support for the photon map extension through rendered
    images. Under Advanced Parameters, just click 'Run Photon Map.' This
    will turn Radiance into a forward ray tracing mode. I have been
    meaning to for a while, but have not implemented this on the rtrace
    / sensor-based calculation side yet. I recommend to set the photon
    port material to the specular material you are using to reflect rays.


  * Another option is to use a mirror material to track the locations of
    solar reflections as per this presentation by Stephen Wasilewski
    <http://radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2015-philadelphia/presentations/day3/150816_radconf_wasilewski.pdf>.
    The advantage is that standard Radiance can be used, and the method
    will work in renderings and grid-based calculations in DIVA. The
    downside is that having many mirror materials in a scene will make
    the calculations substantially slower. If your glare-causing facade
    is curved, you will need to turn it into faceted pieces before using
    this method.

  * Finally, Ji references our paper on reflected solar glare
    <http://asd.sutd.edu.sg/dcc/papers/Jakubiec,Reinhart_2014_AssessingDisabilityGlarePotentialDueToSpecularReflections.pdf>.
    This was using standard Radiance renderings for a single point of
    view (you can assign multiple points of view in DIVA and run them
    with one command). We just rendered images for every 10 minutes of
    sunlit time in the year and used pcomb to combine them into spatial
    time maps (see Figures 5 and 6 in the paper). I guess you are
    primarily a GUI user from your post; however, I'd be happy to share
    the old scripts with you if they might be useful.

Best regards,

Alstan

Hi XuCe,

you need to make use of the ?mirror? material in that case, if you use the classic back-ward mode in Radiance. It will generate a virtual light source for a flat surface. Make sure that the surface normal points to the correct direction.

An example:

void mirror mirrorMat
0
0
4	.9	.9	.9

Please check ray.html as coming with Radiance (directory ray/doc) for details.

Cheers, Lars.
