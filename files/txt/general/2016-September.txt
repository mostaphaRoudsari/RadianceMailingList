Hi Wouter,

Did you create a Klems or a tensor tree representation of your perforated material?  Are the perforations on a rectangular or hexagonal grid?

In either case, I suspect you want your "up" vector as specified by the 3rd-5th string arguments of your "BSDF" primitive to be the Z-axis (0 0 1) rather than the Y-axis (0 1 0).  The latter is more appropriate when the surface is aligned in the X-Z or Y-Z plane.  Although your lamellas curve, so long as they do not curve to a vertical orientation, and +Z up vector should work for you.

The main problem, however, is that you should set your thickness to 0 and don't give front & back surfaces.  Front and back surfaces are only appropriate when you are creating "proxy geometry" for the BSDF.  Here, you are intending the BSDF to substitute for the real geometry, not just serve as a proxy for it.

You could of course create a full model with perforated lamellas and run it through genBSDF without this extra step.  That might even be more accurate, though I appreciate the challenges with creating perforated, curved geometry using commonly available tools.

Cheers,
-Greg

Does anyone have a copy of "cloudy.cal" ?

I seem to have lost the copy I had - might have been replaced by "clouds.cal", but not sure it's the same thing.

Subject: [Radiance-general] Questions concerning rcontrib &
 three-phase-method
Message-ID: <CAEV5Nyf_qXrKkLjmNoz9=HnEyF3hyCyMYVfW8-X2Jvv7_EzAyw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Radiance Users:
I am learning rcontrib & three-phase-method recently and I have a few
questions.

1) In rcontrib_less 4.3, I ran the command to produce point illuminance:
$ cat data/photocells.pts | rcontrib -h -I -fo @rtc.opt -e MF:1 -f
reinhart.cal -b rbin -o results/sensors/p%03d.dat -m sky_glow -w
restroom_whitesky1.oct

However, the error I got is:

rcontrib: fatal - unspecified or illegal bin count for modifier 'sky_glow'

2) In 3-phase-method, When I run the command to generate two view matrices:

$ vwrays -ff -vf views/back.vf -x 600 -y 600 | rcontrib 'vwrays -vf
views/back.vf -x 600 -y 600 -d' -ffc -fo -o images/vmx/window_%03d.hdr -f
klems_int.cal -b kbinS -bn Nkbins -m windowglow -ab 12 -ad 50000 -lw 2e-5
model_vmx.oct

I got:   rcontrib: fatal - missing required modifier argument

I couldn't get much information to solve either of the issues above from
the mailing list. Any suggestion is appreciated.

Thank you,

Hello Zhe,

It's unfortunate that at the moment, we have only incomplete or withdrawn tutorials covering the 3-phase method.  I hope we will be able to remedy this at some point.  You are actually better off using rfluxmtx instead of rcontrib in most cases, as it simplifies operations and incorporates a more generalized version of genklemsamp.

For example, your first command, which must be the basic daylight coefficient (2-phase) method:

	cat data/photocells.pts | rcontrib -h -I -fo @rtc.opt -e MF:1 -f reinhart.cal -b rbin -o results/sensors/p%03d.dat -m sky_glow -w restroom_whitesky1.oct

will run if you add the option "-bn Nrbins" near the "-b" option above, but can be replaced with the simpler call to rfluxmtx:

	rfluxmtx -I @rtc.opt -w - sky.rad -i restroom_nosky.oct < data/photocells.pts

Do not forget the lone hyphen ('-') above -- it tells rfluxmtx to read the sender positions from stdin rather than generating them itself.  Also, the receiver file "sky.rad" should not be included in the octree "restroom_nosky.oct", but should look like this:

##############
#@rfluxmtx o=results/sensors/daycoeff.dat

#@rfluxmtx h=u
void glow groundglow
0
0
4 1 1 1 0
groundglow source ground
0
0
4 0 0 -1 180

#@rfluxmtx h=r4 u=+Y
void glow skyglow
0
0
4 1 1 1 0
skyglow source sky
0
0
4 0 0 1 180
##############

The special comments are very important, as they tell rfluxmtx how to handle each hemisphere and what to do with the data.  (You could also have used the -o option on the command line as before in this case.)  Note that I have removed the "%d" from the file name, because you would have ended up with two sets of coefficients for each sensor point in bin #0.  I am not sure about the rest of the commands in your sequence, so you'll have to figure out how to work with the rearranged output, which will now be in columns of triplets, one triplet for the ground followed by a triplet for each of the 145 sky patches.  Each sensor will thus be represented by 146x3 coefficients in each row of the output matrix "results/sensors/daycoeff.dat".

Some of this is explained in my 2014 "What's New" talk from London:

	http://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2014-london/presentations/day1/Ward_WhatIsNew.pdf

Your second command can also be replaced with a simpler rfluxmtx version, but the actual problem appears to be your substitution of single quotes (') in place of the special back-quote character (`) when you call vwrays with the -d option to set the output image dimensions.

Best,
-Greg

Dear Andy,

I've got two more questions about Radiance.
1) I'm using only 'light' type of source for rtrace operation, the output
of which contains a lot of rays that didn't hit the source in the end.
Loading the ray information of such output takes a long time. I'm curious
if it's possible to export only valid rays that connects receivers with
sources through radiance operation?

2) Another question is about the specular rays and diffuse rays. Is it
possible to specify specular ray from diffuse ones via Radiance operation?
Or have you already counted the energy distribution of these two types of
rays via cosine law in Radiance?

Thank you very much for your help.

Cheers,
Mengdi

Subject: [Radiance-general] How to generate the image of shadow range?
Message-ID: <CACHiZWGfDjErKcRPznvQV13aDeo9OAzJarFRcbGCQV2HD-E9Rw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Radiance users,

I would like to generate a shadow range image to show the shadow movement
in a period of time.
I searched some reference and some of them indicate "pcomb" is able to
combine a bunch of pictures into one hdr image.
So I tried to use pcomb script to combine the hourly daylight images I have
generated, but the overlaid part completely become dark color.
I am not sure is this the correct method to do shadow range because I am
not familiar with this script.
I am wondering if you have any tips or examples can actually generate
shadow range image?

Cheers,

Hi Wen-Hsin,

What is a "shadow range image?"  Can you send a URL with some examples?  As near as I can tell from a Google search, it is just an average image, which is similar to the sum of images you would get from pcomb with multiple HDR inputs and no special arguments.  You could also generate an image of minimum values, where anyplace a shadow fell at any time would appear dark.

The pcomb tool can combine HDR images in many different ways.  You have not shown how you are currently using this tool (the exact command) or what output you are expecting versus what you are getting.  This is essential information for anyone to help you with your problem.

Best,
-Greg

Hi Mengdi,

Did you try using the 'T' option of rtrace, e.g., "-oTMv" will report materials and values for each ray traced.  The lower case 't' leaves out rays to light sources specifically, since there are so many of them in general.  To filter out just the source rays, you need to check the deepest-level (most tabbed) reports in the output and check that the material matches one in your scene description that is the "light" type.

There is no easy way in Radiance to differentiate "specular" from "diffuse" rays in the calculation.  Within the code itself, you can get clues from the ray type, but this isn't one of the things reported by rtrace.  You can of course hack the C code if you like.  That's what it's there for....

Cheers,
-Greg

The desirable condition is: for a bundle of rays hitting the surface, 1) 70% of the rays will follow specular reflection, 30% will be scattered after reflection. 2) for the scattered part, I want them to be reflected within an angle (e.g. 30 degree) to the specular reflected ray.

However the actual number of rays spawned are controlled by the -ad parameter for diffuse rays and -ss parameter for specular rays, with the caveat that only one ray is traced for the specular reflections if the roughness is 0, otherwise you'd be tracing the same ray several times.

If by even you mean that you don't want a cosine factor on the distribution of rays, you should look at plasdata. If however by evenly distributed you don't want them to be randomized, I'm not sure that's possible without going into the Radiance code, and doing this will result in a biased estimate.
