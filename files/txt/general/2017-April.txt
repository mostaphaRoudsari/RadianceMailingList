Christopher,

I think that you bring some interesting points, but I am afraid that you
are mixing few things here. Lets try to untangle it a bit:

- Haze measurement is simplified measurement, but for relatively thin
samples it is reasonably accurate. It does not give you directional
accuracy, nor spectral info, but overall specular vs. scattering split is
pretty good.
- Thick scattering samples are difficult to measure accurately, period.
Haze meter or not. My colleague here at LBNL is working through NFRC and
ICG TC10 to establish criteria how to properly do it. As it turns out large
integrating sphere or full goniophotometer is required to correctly measure
thick samples. Potentially, a correlation could be developed that would
allow measurement using smaller integrating sphere, but that is yet to be
found.
- Fabrics measurement according to EN standard - I am presuming that you
have in mind spectral measurement using ISO 9050 (or EN equivalent). If
not, let me know what EN measurement method you have in mind. One general
observation, though. Fabrics are thin scattering products, so their
measurement is not questionable. EN does not offer any advantage to what we
have developed through the new AERC organization, which will be published
as series of standards later this year.

To summarize, thick scattering samples need to be measured using large
integrating sphere, so neither haze meter nor Spectrophotometer with 150 mm
sphere is adequate. Thin scattering samples, fabrics included can
reasonably be measured with haze meter and Spectrophotometer with 150 mm
sphere, with the provision that haze meter does not give you any spectral
level information or directional resolution, just split between specular
and scattering.

Hi Charlie,
Thanks for the note of confidence in haze factor. I guess if I see a third-party lab ASTM D1003 report for a material, I might consider it for developing an approximate a radiance material definition.

At what thickness do you think haze factor (if reported) might not be reliable for a radiance definition? 5mm acrylic? 10mm laminated glass with diffusing interlayer? Multi-pane IGU maybe 30mm with diffusion applied to on one or more faces or interlayers?

My ASTM / EN comparison with fabric testing was not related to spectral data, but visible transmittance values given according to EN14501 with Tv,n-n & Tv,n-h (maybe the ASTM equivalent is E903 which I believe might be less accurate). Apologies I didn?t think to include those in my previous message, and may have been misleading since not directly related to glazing.

Thanks,
Chris

Wouldn't simple model (based on simple haze value) for Radiance be a BSDF with specular (diagonal) portion being 34% and lambertian portion (uniform diffuse in all directions 66%)? For this specific sample         Tdiff = 0.4686, Tspec = 0.2414. Calculation done using logic below (H=Haze as a fraction).


        Tdiff = H*Ttot
        Adding other fundamentals
        Ttot = Tdiff + Tspec
        Tspec = Ttot-Tdiff = (1-H)*Ttot

HI!

I am trying to model a panel of polycarbonate (modeled as a surface facing the sun).
My goal is to determine the annual solar radiation behind it.

Since I have the following values:

-          Transmission 71%

-          Haze 66%
I am trying to model the polycarbonate as a ?trans? material in Radiance.

Then, I perform the radiation analysis (I use DIVA4RHINO and Daysim model) with the following parameters for the trans material:

void trans polycarbonate
0
0
7 0.972 0.902 0.835 0.07 0 0.706 0.344

But? I obtain very low radiation values (from 30% to 50% of radiation loss).
Does this loss seem unreal as a result?
Do you think that ?trans? material is the right choice for the polycarbonate?

Any suggestion?

Thank you in advance

Erika

Subject: [Radiance-general] Meaning of EPW file's minute field and why is it
 60 in TMY2-based EPW and 0 in TMY3-based EPW?
Message-ID: <CAP+EAU7jXEO2cY=ePtk=7u_PgSqu_SF=FjzGyqtur6GEr4cC1Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I am new to EnergyPlus, Daysim and Radiance. I am looking at the process of
converting EPW files to WEA files.

I am trying to understand the meaning of the minute field in an EPW file.

I read in
http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2012-October/008968.html
that the minutes field does not relate to '*the time when the measurement
was recorded, but to the **recording interval'.*

The EPW Data Dictionary (
http://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/8-3/auxiliary-programs/energyplus-weather-file-epw-data-dictionary.html#field-minute)
is not useful for understanding the meaning of the minutes field, as it
simply says:

* Field: Hour - This is the hour of the data. (1 - 24). Hour 1 is 00:01 to
01:00. Cannot be missing.

* Field: Minute - This is the minute field. (1..60)

If I take the EPW file for Gatwick Airport in London (
https://energyplus.net/weather-location/europe_wmo_region_6/GBR//GBR_London.Gatwick.037760_IWEC)
I see that its minute fields are set to 60 (hours and minutes in bold):

...

DATA PERIODS,1,1,Data,Sunday, 1/ 1,12/31

1991,1,1,*1,60*,...

1991,1,1,*2,60*,...

...

If instead I take the TMY3-based EPW file for Central Park in New York (
https://energyplus.net/weather-location/north_and_central_america_wmo_region_4/USA/NY/USA_NY_New.York-Central.Park.725033_TMY3),
I see that its minute fields are set to 0 :

...

DATA PERIODS,1,1,Data,Sunday, 1/ 1,12/31

1976,1,1,*1,0*,...

1976,1,1,*2,0*,...

...

Yet if I take the TMY2-based EPW file for Central Park in New York (
https://energyplus.net/weather-location/north_and_central_america_wmo_region_4/USA/NY/USA_NY_New.York.City-Central.Park.744860_TMY2),
I see that its minute fields are set to 0:

...

DATA PERIODS,1,1,Data,Sunday, 1/ 1,12/31

1976,1,1,*1,60*,...

1976,1,1,*2,60*,...

...

Can someone please explain in simple terms what the meaning is of the
minutes field?

Why is there a difference in the value of the minutes fields in the
IWEC-based EPW file for Gatwick (value is 0) and in the TMY3-based EPW file
for Central Park (value is 60)? What is the minutes field telling me about
the data?

Why is there a difference in the value of the minutes fields in the EPW
file for Central Park depending on whether it is TMY2-based (in which case
the value is 60) or TMY3 based (in which case the value is 0)?

Thank you in advance for your help,

Philip Schwarz

If you take a look at the tmy2 man page, you'll see that illuminance is for
the 60 minutes preceding the time. Thus, the values for a time of "10:60"
maps to the hour starting 10:00:00 and ending at 10:59:59.

Sorry, that sent before I was ready. Similar verbiage is found for TMY3 on
http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy08osti/43156.pdf. My best guess for why there is
a zero in the minutes for Gatwick in the TMY3 and a 60 in the TMY2 is that
someone made a mistake. But I'm sure a more precise answer will emerge on
this list.

A bit more info...

The minute field in the EPW has little meaning (ever) for hourly based
files. Frankly the TMY2 should have been 00 rather than 60. They have some
meaning for subhourly files but aren't ever parsed for EnergyPlus usage.

Note that the TMY3 files on EnergyPlus.net are not updated to the latest
version (TMY3a) from January 2015 (correcting illuminance, precipitation
and a few other issues).

Up to date TMY3a data are available from http://climate.onebuilding.org .
The zips there also include .WEA (Daysim format) as well as EPW, CLM (ESP-r
format)  along with substantially expanded statistics. Climate.OneBuilding
has more than 2,200 locations throughout the world -- many not available on
EnergyPlus.net.

Message-ID: <CAGV9VE03tFGhwpa-as-YVxr3xnpOA9raBj4G_Nf-9V6=05Xwuw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Guys,

I am writing mainly to understand Radiance more on different methods on
irradiance calculation on surface point while maintaining accuracy and
speed.

- I can use rtrace with irradiance interpolation turned on and rely on high
-ad( >1024) for direct light from sky.
running Radiance on Windows, it didn't seem to do run it in multi
processing(-n). I am not sure if this is supported on Windows?
Also breaking the points in chunks and running separate rtrace processes
didn't seem to speed it up much.
I don't go mad with -a numbers but the time tends to increase, sometimes up
to an hour for a room on complex models.

- I tried mkillum to increase the speed/accuracy but as the model is all
triangles I get the "aiming failure" error messages,
 and it was mentioned in another post that triangles are poor choice for
light sources(due to the way Radiance samples
direct lighting.) I guess mkillum may not be advised in this case? also the
calc time increases linearly with with more illums in the model.

- rtrace with interpolation switched off, seems to be pretty quick. but as
it is blind monte carlo there is a concern on accuracy on
direct lighting I guess(unless using high -ad). I have seen the window
glazing defined as glow in three phase method(and later to use genbsdf for
T).
I am not quite familiar but if glow material is part of the direct
lighting, would this make it a better approach than pure MC?

thanks and apology for this long post,
Ali

Hi Ali,

Multiprocessing is not supported under Windows using rtrace, unfortunately.

Mkillum is not advisable if you are just computing illuminance points.

Turning interpolation off with rtrace (-aa 0) is a reasonable thing to do for point calculations, especially if you have only a handful of values you are computing.  The payoff for the ambient cache is when you have many bounces and/or many calculation points.

Best,
-Greg

Just a quick note about -aa 0.  I've found that illuminance result without
the ambient cache is lower than the result with an ambient cache and the
same simulation settings.  I recommend decreasing -lw substantially when
-aa 0 is used. Convergence testing with a few points furthest from the
window is always a good idea, particularly when using -aa 0.

And a quick trick that used to work is to run several iterations and average them, if you are only testing a single point.
It is more precise than a single shot.

Subject: [Radiance-general] epw2wea and how it processes EPW field 'Number
 of Records per hour'
Message-ID: <CAP+EAU46JsyAoEM+AQJfjyPQi5NcLdRpPOc1YW0Ka2Sj6a-M1Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

In the EPW data dictionary documentation (http://bigladdersoftware.com/
epx/docs/8-3/auxiliary-programs/energyplus-weather-file-epw-
data-dictionary.html), I see the following:

================================================
DATA PERIODS,
N1, \field Number Number of Data Periods
N2, \field Number of Records per hour
...
A weather file may contain several ?data periods? though this is not
required (and, in fact, may be detrimental). In addition, *a weather file
may contain multiple records per hour* BUT these must match the Number of
Time Steps In Hour for the simulation.

================================================

If I look at the program that converts EPW files to WEA files (
http://www.radiance-online.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/ray/src/cv/epw2wea.c),
It seems to make use of the  'Records per hour' field. I see that the code
has a 'minute' variable that it initialises to 60, and it also has the
following chunk of logic that manipulates the minute variable:

	fprintf(WEA_FILE,"site_elevation %s\nweather_data_file_units 1\n",elevation);

	fscanf(EPW_FILE,"%*[^\n]");fscanf(EPW_FILE,"%*[\n\r]");
	fscanf(EPW_FILE,"%*[^\n]");fscanf(EPW_FILE,"%*[\n\r]");
	fscanf(EPW_FILE,"%*[^\n]");fscanf(EPW_FILE,"%*[\n\r]");
	fscanf(EPW_FILE,"%*[^\n]");fscanf(EPW_FILE,"%*[\n\r]");
	fscanf(EPW_FILE,"%*[^\n]");fscanf(EPW_FILE,"%*[\n\r]");
	fscanf(EPW_FILE,"%*[^\n]");fscanf(EPW_FILE,"%*[\n\r]");
	fscanf(EPW_FILE,"%*[^\n]");fscanf(EPW_FILE,"%*[\n\r]");
		
	/* read in time step interval */
	fscanf(EPW_FILE,"%[^,]s",keyword);
	fscanf(EPW_FILE,",%[^,]s",keyword);
	fscanf(EPW_FILE,",%[^,]s",minute_string);
	minute=atoi(minute_string);
	if(minute==1)   /* one measurement per hour equals a 60 minute time step */
		minute=60;
	fscanf(EPW_FILE,"%*[^\n]");fscanf(EPW_FILE,"%*[\n\r]");

	while( EOF != fscanf(EPW_FILE,"%d,%d,%d,%d",&year,&month,&day, &hour_in)){
		
		fprintf(WEA_FILE,"%d %d %.3f ",month,day,hour_in*1.0-minute*(0.5/60));


If we look at a sample EPW file, e.g. https://energyplus.net/we

================================================

then it seems to me that the chunk of logic is targeted at the 'Records per
hour' field. When execution reaches the logic chunk, the program has just
finished processing line 1 of the data,

LOCATION,New York Central Prk Obs Belv,NY,USA,TMY3,725033,40.78,
-73.97,-5.0,40.0

so it skips seven lines and gets to the following:

DATA PERIODS,1,1,Data,Sunday, 1/ 1,12/31

It then skips 'DATA PERIODS' and the first '1' and reads the second '1'
into the minute variable. It then looks at the value in the minute
variable, and if it is one, it overwrites that value with 60.
(Why overwrite in with 60 if it was already initialised to 60?)
I then goes into a loop in which it repeatedly
* reads in year, month, day and hour_in
* writes out to the WEA file the month, day and hour_in, but in doing so,
it adjusts hour_in based on the content of the minute variable:
hour_in*1.0-minute*(0.5/60).
It looks like it is adjusting say 9 (9AM) to 8.30 when minute=60 and
leaving 9 alone when minute=0.

Can someone please explain why the code is doing that?
Why does it set the value of the minute variable if the 'Records per hour'
field is 1, but not if it is other values? What other values can it be? 0,
2, 3, 15, 30, 60, other?

Thank you in advance for your help,

Philip Schwarz

Message-ID: <CAGV9VE3Roo0CN=Z2DMbdpeADo5J8mW0-jUoBOmRtCGqxWDZAsA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello guys,

I am a bit struggling to make sense of numbers I get. I might have done
something wrong.
The rtrace gives roughly same irradiance figures(apart from the exponent
component) for overcast sky generated with -b 10, -b 100, -b 1000,
or any other power of 10, while -b 1 gives slightly higher value.

rtrace -w -h -I -ab 12 -ad 10000 0 -as 4096 -aa 0 -ar 0 -lw 1E-05 room.oct
< pnt.txt

!gensky 3 21 10 -c -a 51 -o 0 -m 0 -b 1

-b 1:       9.245390e-002   9.245390e-002   9.245390e-002
-b 10:     9.045287e-001   9.045287e-001   9.045287e-001
-b 100:   9.023538e+000   9.023538e+000   9.023538e+000
-b 1000: 9.039278e+001   9.039278e+001   9.039278e+001

This is a simple room with an opening and no glazing.

Thanks,
Ali

Hello Ali,

I think you are missing the "order of magnitude" (i.e. the eXXXX value
after the number) of the scientific notation. In "normal math", the numbers
you are getting are:

which are different in one order of magnitude, just as your -b input.

Thanks for your reply.

I think I expect to get at least same digits for the first few places. The
- b 10, 100, 1000 share equal first two digits that is 9 and 0(apart from
the exponent).
so I expect to see -b 1 to come as -b1 : 0.090..

Ali,
If you run the same commands multiple times, do you always get similar results? Does -b 1 always give proportionally 2% higher value than the higher orders of magnitude if you repeat the process multiple times, or does it vary?

If you change the ?ad or ?lw parameters do you get any different degree of consistency?

Hello guys,

I am a bit struggling to make sense of numbers I get. I might have done something wrong.
The rtrace gives roughly same irradiance figures(apart from the exponent component) for overcast sky generated with -b 10, -b 100, -b 1000,
or any other power of 10, while -b 1 gives slightly higher value.

rtrace -w -h -I -ab 12 -ad 10000 0 -as 4096 -aa 0 -ar 0 -lw 1E-05 room.oct < pnt.txt

!gensky 3 21 10 -c -a 51 -o 0 -m 0 -b 1

-b 1:       9.245390e-002   9.245390e-002   9.245390e-002
-b 10:     9.045287e-001   9.045287e-001   9.045287e-001

This is a simple room with an opening and no glazing.

Yes the posted figures are sort of avg of multiple runs.

I noticed for -b 10, 100,... options the -ad has to be increased to some x4
more to get same accuracy as -b 1.
But I am not sure if this is expected in Radiance.

I don?t think I?ll have the answer to your question, but to be sure we all understand? although you get more consistent values between ?b 10, 100, and 1000, when you increase ?ad they all converge toward the trend you would expect from ?b 1?

Hi Ali,

I agree that this is an interesting and unexpected result.  I've looked over the code, and I suspect the cause is having so many ambient samples for a small starting radiance is causing the ambient super-sampling code to hit the 1e-7 (FTINY) threshold for ignoring differences between adjacent ambient divisions.

What happens to your series when you use -as 0.  I would expect the errors to go up for all brightnesses, but hopefully you will at least get the same errors for all gensky -b settings at that point.  This would confirm my suspicion, and allow me to implement a fix.

Cheers,
-Greg

Hi Greg,

True that was the cause :) It gives ~same results with -as 0 for all -b
values though less accurate.

Thanks, Ali, for the quick confirmation.  I just checked in a fix for the -as option to the CVS head.

Cheers,

I've looked over the code, and I suspect the cause is having so many ambient samples for a small starting radiance is causing the ambient super-sampling code to hit the 1e-7 (FTINY) threshold for ignoring differences between adjacent ambient divisions.

Subject: [Radiance-general] 16th Annual International Radiance Workshop
Message-ID: <CAJgQ_PN3fjO0nJudwH6Spycv1ZyAf3cCkbx63s0p3O9sAAqG5w@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings daylighters,

The Energy Studies in Buildings Laboratory (ESBL) is pleased to host this
year's International Radiance Workshop at the University of Oregon campus
in Portland, Oregon, USA!

The event will begin with an optional viewing of the 2017 total solar
eclipse on the morning of Monday, August 21st. The traditional 3-day
Radiance workshop will then continue from Tuesday, August 22nd through
Thursday, August 24th. And finally, Friday, August 25th will feature an
optional one-day hands-on Radiance training aimed at professionals and
students looking to learn more about Radiance daylighting simulation.

Details on registration and fees will be made available shortly, with
another e-mail reminder to follow. The eclipse viewing and Radiance
training events will each be available as separate and optional additions
to the general admission for the traditional 3-day Radiance workshop.
Students will also receive a 50% discount for the optional hands-on
Radiance training.

*The call for presenters is live!* We invite you to share your work with
the Radiance community in a 30-minute presentation format. Presenters and
students will receive a 20% and 40% registration discount respectively for
the traditional 3-day workshop. If you are interested in presenting your
work please go to https://radiance.uoregon.edu/call-for-presenters/ and
submit a short abstract (up to 250-words; 1 optional figure/image; submit
by June 1st, 2017). Multiple proposals per presenter are acceptable!

The event website is available at https://radiance.uoregon.edu. Any
inquiries can be directed to Stephanie Luiere (sluiere at uoregon.edu) or
myself (alen at uoregon.edu).

We look forward to seeing you in Portland!


Sincerely,

Alen Mahi? and Kevin Van Den Wymelenberg, ESBL, University of Oregon

Subject: [Radiance-general] Readability of the Radiance website
Message-ID: <CAAKioo1cXfoOEn5OAGfm3kVkypcDDSOtT-tMg418ufCSqC8asQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear group,

After many years I have become one of the older (in age) users of Radiance.
Although I am more or less retired I still enjoy to work with Radiance. My
problem is that, due to the extreme low contrast between the text and the
b(l)ackground, I do have more and more difficulties to read the website.
For example pages like this one:
https://radiance-online.org/learning/documentation/manual-pages
are hardly readable for me.
I asume that I have to ask Andy to please consider to edit the text colors
of the site to give the text a higher contrast with the background. After
all this is a lighting program and lighting is all about the right contrast.

Kind regards,

Laurens Zonneveldt
