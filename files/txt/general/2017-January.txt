Dear users,
Happy New Year.?I am looking for the best way to represent a gray semi transparent solar screen in radiance. Would it be to represent is as a sheet of glass with the total light transmissions or?The screen is placed on the exterior side of the window and has a solartransmission of 6%, light transmission of 6% and an openness factor of 4%.The colour rendering index is 100.The total light transmissions of the screen and glass is 4%.

If you use the ?glass? material type, you would get varying reflection/transmission at certain angles based on Snell?s law, refractive index, critical angle, etc. ? on both sides of the glass, which might not be representative of your system. You could consider one surface/layer to represent the glass (?glass? material type might be good enough approximation) and another layer to represent the screen (maybe ?trans? material type unless you want to specify angular-dependent properties). If you want to combine the effect of glass with screen into one surface/layer then you probably need to consider something more complex if the different reflective properties on each side of the system are important. There are also more accurate ways to model glass if it has specific coatings, etc. that are important to the results.

Hi Per,

The Radiance "BRTDfunc" material offers the most control over these parameters, and can be done with a single surface.  The "glaze" script can get you pretty close to what you want by simulating your system as a single-pane fritted glazing.  I generated the following using a 95% coverage (corresponding roughly to a 4% visibility factor):

% glaze
###
### NOTE: Using internal demo database!
###

Enter the number of panes in the system: 1

Window normal faces interior

  | |
  | |
  | |
  | |-->
  | |
  | |
  | |
 s1 s2

Supported surface types are:
   1 - clear glass
   2 - VE1-2M low-E coating
   3 - PVB laminated
   4 - V-175 white frit
   5 - V-933 warm gray frit

What is the type of s1? 5
What is the type of s2? 1
Enter fraction coverage for s1 (0-1): .95

Based on the output above, the gray frit I used (V-933) is not dark enough to simulate your system, since the tranmission is about twice too high (0.129616 instead of 0.06).  This is mostly in the diffuse transmitted part, so you can probably adjust the 0.0855 values above to something like 0.02 (three times) to get close to your 6% total transmission.  I have no idea what the diffuse reflection values should be, since you didn't give us those measurements.

Cheers,
-Greg

HI Per,

I changed the subject back to the original, but I see that you sent this reply to me alone.

The BRTDfunc type is a material in Radiance, so it should modify a surface directly, not another material.  Therefore, you should apply your "glaze1_unnamed" material directly to the polygon of your window.

Your changes to the arguments are as I suggested to get the desired total transmission.  If light reflection is 76% and our frit coverage is 95%, that means that the "back side" diffuse reflection should be much higher -- around 78% or so.  I would suggest changing the specification as follows:

void BRTDfunc glaze1_unnamed
10
    sr_frit_r sr_frit_g sr_frit_b
    st_frit_r st_frit_g st_frit_b
    0 0 0
    glaze1.cal
0
11 0.0722 0.06935 0.06745 0.78 0.78 0.78 0.02 0.02 0.02 1    .95

The actual reflection on the exterior of the building will matter more to outside views than inside views and illumination.  Do they give any information about interior reflection for the shading system?  This would affect what we specify for the first three arguments.

Cheers,
-Greg

Hi folks,

When simulating linear electric lights, setting -ds 1 seems to spread the luminous flux over the entire emitting surface. When those sources are reflected however, the reflection shows the output as if -ds isn't set, like this:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/6lddahgf716yzip/reflection.JPG?dl=0

Is there a way to force direct sampling into reflected sources? Or perhaps something else is going on I'm confused by... Thanks for any tips!

Hi Michael,

You may be confusing your options.  The -ds option subdivides light sources, and -ds 1 is a rather large value to apply.  Better to use a smaller-than-default value if you want better soft shadows.  The default is "-ds 0.25" and you could try "-ds 0.1".  You should also try setting the "-dj" option to randomly sample your light sources.  Setting "-dj 1" should sample the full source area, which is why I think you may be confusing your options based on what you said.

This is not the reason you are seeing stuff in the reflections, however.  You are seeing them there because the reflections are maybe 4% as bright as the non-reflected portions, and the latter are clipped so as not to be visible.  If you reduced your exposure, I expect the pattern would look the same.

Cheers,
-Greg

Ah, thanks Greg. For many settings I often mix up low quality vs high quality limits (is -ds 1 really good? or is it -ds .01 that's really good?...)

Your reminder got me on the right track, and -ds did in fact solve the reflected source issues:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/as336wx434x1gbi/reflection_ds.JPG?dl=0

For my future search of this question on the archives - when simulating reflected linear electric sources, set -ds to .1 or less (but not 0)!

Mike

Hi Greg,
Thank you for your reply. It is much helpful.The data sheet holds no information on the interior reflection so no help there. The material composition is 64% PVC & 36% fibreglass if that is of any help based on you experience.

HI Per,

I changed the subject back to the original, but I see that you sent this reply to me alone.

The BRTDfunc type is a material in Radiance, so it should modify a surface directly, not another material.? Therefore, you should apply your "glaze1_unnamed" material directly to the polygon of your window.

Your changes to the arguments are as I suggested to get the desired total transmission.? If light reflection is 76% and our frit coverage is 95%, that means that the "back side" diffuse reflection should be much higher -- around 78% or so.? I would suggest changing the specification as follows:

void BRTDfunc glaze1_unnamed

The actual reflection on the exterior of the building will matter more to outside views than inside views and illumination.? Do they give any information about interior reflection for the shading system?? This would affect what we specify for the first three arguments.

Hi Per,

I am re-editing your subject line again.  Please, when responding to the mailing list especially, make sure that your subject line stays consistent for searches, and it is best *not* to include the entire digest, as it often contains different threads (though not in this case).  The instructions regarding the subject line are repeated below, so no excuses.

Unfortunately, I cannot glean much useful information based on the material composition.  I'm not a material scientist, but presumably they could put any number of dyes and pigments in their PVC/fiberglass mix.  If the exterior reflectance is 76%, however, I would expect the interior reflectance to be similar unless there is something unusual about the construction.  The glass will reduce this slightly (88% squared), so it is probably reasonable to set the interior diffuse reflectance to something like 0.66 for the first three values:

void BRTDfunc glaze1_unnamed
10
    sr_frit_r sr_frit_g sr_frit_b
    st_frit_r st_frit_g st_frit_b
    0 0 0
    glaze1.cal
0
11 0.66 0.66 0.66 0.78 0.78 0.78 0.02 0.02 0.02 1    .95

The above is a reasonable guess, I believe.

Cheers,
-Greg

Hi all,

Does anyone know how can I get size (x-size, y-size) and number of pixels
of an 1) HDR picture which was made in Radiance but these parameters have
not been defined when 'rpict' was used to make them, and 2) HDR pictures
that were not made in Radiance?

Cheers,
Parisa

Hi,

I have a rather basic question about color definition for plastic material and hope someone could help me.

mod plastic id
0
0
5 red green blue spec rough

Does the red, green and blue define diffuse reflection or total reflection?

For example, if a material reflect 40% light diffusely and 10% specularly, is it correct to define this material as:
Void plastic testMaterial
0
0
5 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.1 0

I was checking with the spectrum data from SUTD http://www.lighting-materials.com/materials/648

And it seems they are using the other approach which defines R G and B with total reflection and the material will be
Void plastic testMaterial
0
0
5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.1 0

Hello Xiaoming,

If I understand the Materials documentation
<http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/materials.pdf> correctly, I would
say that the Red, Green and Blue are total reflection. If specularity is
non-zero, the diffuse reflection is reduced by this amount:

rho_d = p*C*(1-specularity)

At least, that would be my guess.

Best!

Hi Germ?n,

Thank you very for your reply and suggestions. I am still not sure what values I should put in the material definition. According to the definition in:
rho_d = p*C*(1-specularity)

For a material with 50% of incoming light reflected diffusely and 10% specularly then

C= 0.5/(1-0.1) = 0.555

Shall I define the material as follow?

Void plastic diffuse_50
0
0
5 0.555 0.555 0.555 0.1 0

Regards,
Xiaoming

Hi Xiaoming,

mmm... I would say you are looking for a 60% reflective material (10%
specular, 50% diffuse).

In that case, I would choose a1, a2, a3 = 60% and the specularity would be
(C-rho_d)/C = 16,666%. (16.6666%*60% = 10%).

It seems that I have the same issue as you, though.... my calculation of
total reflectance is not correct when comparing to Lighting Materials
website.

Anyone actually know these things?

Kind regards,

Xiaoming -- the calculation you performed based on the correct formula Germ?n gave you should yield a material with 50% diffuse and 10% specular reflectance.

The reason the Radiance material parameters are defined as they are, and "trans" is much more confusing than "plastic" or "metal", is so that there are clearly physical and non-physical ranges for each value.  As long as you are between 0 and 1 in the first four parameters for "plastic" or "metal," you know your material will not reflect more light than reaches it.

Cheers,
-Greg

Hi Germ?n, Xiaoming,

Thank you both for pointing this out and having me go back to check the 
work on specular materials. I indeed made a pretty critical mistake by 
momentarily forgetting the tricky procedural nature of Radiance 
materials... and then never noticing. This is rather a shame after 
spending a long time getting a trans material just perfect earlier in 
the week. First of all, big apologies for the mistake. All diffuse 
materials, metals, and the specialized PV materials should be correct on 
the website. Things with specularity will have some errors, and I will 
fix this soon.

In the interim, the specularity and total reflectance values on the 
website are correct, and you can fix individual R, G or B coefficients 
with a little math:

(R_Website - Specularity_Website) / (1-Specularity_Website) = R

So in the case of the material referenced earlier 
<http://www.lighting-materials.com/materials/648>,

R = (0.3517 - 0.0218) / (1 - 0.0218) = 0.3373
G = (0.3480 - 0.0218) / (1 - 0.0218) = 0.3335
B = (0.3313 - 0.0218) / (1 - 0.0218) = 0.3164

Again, I apologize for the mistake. I will post a public message here 
when all is corrected on the website.

Germ?n, I owe you a separate e-mail and will reply soon afterwards :).

Xiaoming, to answer your question: If you want a 50% diffuse and 10% 
specular material, then indeed the R/G/B coefficients are 0.5556 and the 
specularity is 0.1 as far as I understand the functioning of the 
material models. Germ?n, R_specular is simply equal to the specularity 
in the plastic material. In that sense, Red, Green and Blue are not the 
total reflection (that's the mistake I made). Rather they represent the 
percentage of the leftover light after specular reflection that is then 
reflected diffusely.
R_diffuse = 0.5556*(1-0.1) = 0.5
R_specular = 0.1
R_total = R_diffuse + R_specular

Best,
Alstan

Hello All,

Thank you for sharing a link to the http://www.lighting-materials.com/ database. This is a useful reference to have.

I want to understand how R_reflectance, G_reflectance, B_reflectance are calculated, as defined for a material in the online database. Can someone please explain how these were calculated? Is the Radiance RGB triplet (as obtained from xyz_rgb.cal) simply scaled by total reflectance to obtain these?

Radiance 5.0 official release contains a script, colorcal.csh, does this script convert spectral reflectance straight to a RGB material primitive definition, or does the resulting RGB triplet need to be scaled by total or diffuse reflectance?

As I understand from previous posts for the red channel, R_material definition = (R_website - Specularity_website) / (1 - Specularity_website). Can someone please clarify how R_website was determined.

I want to clearly understand how a Radiance material definition is generated from spectral reflectance.

Thank you for the help,
Andrei Kolomenski

Hi Germ?n, Xiaoming,

Thank you both for pointing this out and having me go back to check the work on specular materials. I indeed made a pretty critical mistake by momentarily forgetting the tricky procedural nature of Radiance materials... and then never noticing. This is rather a shame after spending a long time getting a trans material just perfect earlier in the week. First of all, big apologies for the mistake. All diffuse materials, metals, and the specialized PV materials should be correct on the website. Things with specularity will have some errors, and I will fix this soon.

In the interim, the specularity and total reflectance values on the website are correct, and you can fix individual R, G or B coefficients with a little math:

(R_Website - Specularity_Website) / (1-Specularity_Website) = R
So in the case of the material referenced earlier<http://www.lighting-materials.com/materials/648>,

R = (0.3517 - 0.0218) / (1 - 0.0218) = 0.3373
G = (0.3480 - 0.0218) / (1 - 0.0218) = 0.3335
B = (0.3313 - 0.0218) / (1 - 0.0218) = 0.3164

Again, I apologize for the mistake. I will post a public message here when all is corrected on the website.

Germ?n, I owe you a separate e-mail and will reply soon afterwards :).

Xiaoming, to answer your question: If you want a 50% diffuse and 10% specular material, then indeed the R/G/B coefficients are 0.5556 and the specularity is 0.1 as far as I understand the functioning of the material models. Germ?n, R_specular is simply equal to the specularity in the plastic material. In that sense, Red, Green and Blue are not the total reflection (that's the mistake I made). Rather they represent the percentage of the leftover light after specular reflection that is then reflected diffusely.
R_diffuse = 0.5556*(1-0.1) = 0.5
R_specular = 0.1
R_total = R_diffuse + R_specular

Best,
Alstan

Hi Xiaoming,

mmm... I would say you are looking for a 60% reflective material (10% specular, 50% diffuse).

In that case, I would choose a1, a2, a3 = 60% and the specularity would be (C-rho_d)/C = 16,666%. (16.6666%*60% = 10%).
It seems that I have the same issue as you, though.... my calculation of total reflectance is not correct when comparing to Lighting Materials website.
Anyone actually know these things?
Kind regards,

Hi Germ?n,

Thank you very for your reply and suggestions. I am still not sure what values I should put in the material definition. According to the definition in:
rho_d = p*C*(1-specularity)

For a material with 50% of incoming light reflected diffusely and 10% specularly then

C= 0.5/(1-0.1) = 0.555

Shall I define the material as follow?

Void plastic diffuse_50
0
0
5 0.555 0.555 0.555 0.1 0

Xiaoming

Hello Xiaoming,
If I understand the Materials documentation<http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/materials.pdf> correctly, I would say that the Red, Green and Blue are total reflection. If specularity is non-zero, the diffuse reflection is reduced by this amount:
rho_d = p*C*(1-specularity)

At least, that would be my guess.

Best!

Hi,

I have a rather basic question about color definition for plastic material and hope someone could help me.

mod plastic id
0
0
5 red green blue spec rough

Does the red, green and blue define diffuse reflection or total reflection?

For example, if a material reflect 40% light diffusely and 10% specularly, is it correct to define this material as:
Void plastic testMaterial
0
0
5 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.1 0

I was checking with the spectrum data from SUTD http://www.lighting-materials.com/materials/648

And it seems they are using the other approach which defines R G and B with total reflection and the material will be
Void plastic testMaterial
0
0
5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.1 0

Hi Andrei,

The R, G, and B triplets on the website (at least those measured by me) 
are directly translated from explicit photometric measurements using a 
KM 2600d spectrophotometer. We use the same scripts that are in the 
Rendering with Radiance book for doing this. If I recall correctly, the 
X, Y and Z tristimulus values are calculated simply by using the 
spectral measurements with the color matching functions (via 
cieresp.cal), and then xyz_rgb.cal is invoked.

The spectrophotometer takes measurements with specular component 
included (SCI) and with specular component excluded (SCE). Since plastic 
specularity is equal energy, specularity is simply Reflectance_SCI - 
Reflectance_SCE. The error in the database I referred to was something 
naive I wrote long ago and never noticed: the R, G and B values 
displayed currently (R_website) come directly from the SCI measurement; 
therefore, they contain the specular portions of the measurements. They 
should be based on SCE values (diffuse reflections) and be further 
scaled by 1/(1-Specularity) in order to be photometrically correct. 
Hence the correction equation I posted earlier in this thread. Come 
tomorrow morning (Singapore time), the issue should be fixed.

In good news, for 99% of the materials on the website, this makes little 
or no difference. For highly specular plastics, the extra diffuse 
reflection which results can be moderately large.

Roughness values are not calibrated for most materials, and if they have 
been, it is simply by an eye test.

Best,
Alstan

Hello everyone,

I am happy to report that the lighting materials website 
<http://lighting-materials.com/> is back up, and specular plastics now 
reflect the correct diffuse values. Thank you to everyone for the 
helpful discussion, and I will also be uploading some new materials soon!

Picking a random, highly specular measurement (Greg's stainless steel 
sink in 1995 <http://lighting-materials.com/materials/1444>) should show 
that the diffuse characteristics are now correct.

    R_diffuse = (0.3937*0.265 + 0.3734*0.670 + 0.3281*0.065)*(1-0.0821)
    = 0.345
    R_specular = 0.0821
    R_total = R_diffuse + R_specular = 0.4271

Subject: [Radiance-general] DEM to .rad pipeline
Message-ID: <CAFPP+oKiS=Yzw6s-paROSRaf+B=_67yD1PP9sLXOXsJ149i_Ng@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Radiance community,

I am very new to radiance and thus this may come across as a novice or
naive question. I hope to use radiance to model daylight on exterior
surfaces. The geometry I work with are DEMs typically coming in raster
(geotiff) format.

Can anyone suggest a most efficient (or path of least resistance) workflow
to translate the DEMs into Radiance scene description file?

I can convert the raster DEM into one of the many vectorized mesh-based
formats (i.e., some type of CAD format); but am hoping the community may
have some insight here to help narrow this down for me (best CAD file
type). It seems a triangle-mesh file would be ideal; wonder if there is
software that export this file type?

Any advice, references to plug-ins or tips would be most appreciated!

Sincerely,
Ian
