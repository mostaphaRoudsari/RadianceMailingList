Hi Laurens,
Dan Fuller maintains all the Plone settings for the radiance-online
website, which includes colors and font sizes. I'll forward your request
for improved contrast to Dan.

Dear list,

I've managed to create unwanted diffuse "ripples" within diffuse pools of light. I'm working with -aa 0 renderings, and having a tough time smoothing things out.

In this example,<https://www.dropbox.com/s/fr23tpnv5uqlhxg/clear_section.jpg?dl=0> the diffuse bit of sky component directly below the skylight has subtle ripples of darkness in the pool of light, and also in the bright ceiling above the patch of direct sun...

With a trans material in the skylight<https://www.dropbox.com/s/ptco2powrlhy48x/diffuse_section.jpg?dl=0>, the pattern is even more noticeable, and you can see it mapped onto the walls of the scene as well...

Settings for these runs (which are oversampled x12):
-dp 4096 -ms .14 -ds .1 -dj .9 -dt .05 -dr 3 -ss 16 -st .01 -ab 3 -av 0 0 0 -ar 0 -ad 64 -as 0 -aa 0 -ps 1 -pt .04 -lr 12 -lw 1e-5

Things I've tried with no luck:
- big and small -ar values;  300, 800, 3000 (I recall an old tip from Mark Stock to crank -ar with -aa 0 to get rid of halos?)
- various -ad settings (16, 32 64, 200) while keeping -as 0
-turned on -as with -ad 64 and -as 32
- tried a negative value for -lr
- tried making -lw super small; 1e-10

I'm using the rad program to turn on penumbras - maybe there's something in the -dx, -sx, or -px settings I'm unaware of?

Many thanks for any ideas...

MM

Hi Michael,

Shouldn?t really happen, nonetheless perhaps it is possible that there?s some weird alias like effect happening with this geometry and the very small ad.

Do your renderings have to be aa 0, and have you tried larger ad values?

Cheers
John

Are you using pcond on the image? I had a similar looking issue caused by

Hi Michael,

Adding back original message, which somehow got lost in my spam folder...

Which version of Radiance are you using?  (I.e., what does "rpict -version" say?)  I found a couple of minor sampling issues in the interreflection code, though I'm not sure if they could cause this effect.  The last fix was a couple of weeks ago, so pretty recent by Radiance standards.

-Greg

P.S.  If you send me your scene in a private e-mail, I'll have a closer look when I get a chance.

I've gotten this error on multiple projects, It's visible in rvu, rpict
results and images made with rtrace.  It is most apparent on -ab 1 so it
comes from either the light through the skylight direct from skyglow (with
a clear material) or the first ray through the trans material from a direct
source.  Small openings have more pronounced patterning compared with
larger openings (large opening at top small opening at bottom:
https://goo.gl/photos/stsFoix8s4cE3wk46).  It looks like a diffraction
pattern and kind of behaves like one (smaller opening, more prominent),
does something in the ray sampling explain why the apertures act like
diffraction slits?  would it go away with a really high -ad?  is it also
there with ambient caching, but the interpolation smooths it out?

This artifact appears to be fixed in the CVS head.  It must have been related to sample collision avoidance, which I was doing in a rather ham-fisted way in the first Hessian implementation.  (And yes, it affected results with -aa 0 more noticeably.)  The newer version of ambcomp.c uses a more subtle and successful rejection sampling method, which doesn't bias the original samples.

I put this fix in back in October, but we've been waiting on some unrelated code changes before building the changes into the latest Windows distro.  So, if you're working from that, or you haven't installed the more recent binaries for Linux or Mac, you should do that first.

Cheers,
-Greg

Ah! Nothing better than new source code to fix your problem... Just installed the latest HEAD and everything looking great with rpict version 5.1a<https://www.dropbox.com/s/41rx9ii17qwepgi/51a.jpg?dl=0>.

Thanks for the feedback everyone.

I had originally run with version 4.3a (eesh - old...). Tried with 5.0 official release, still no good<https://www.dropbox.com/s/cx83dihv0uucyf0/50.jpg?dl=0>.

Stefan - glad I wasn't the only one...

Andy - yep, using pcond but as Stephen mentioned, it was visible any way you looked at it.

John - I've been using more and more -aa 0 runs for models with more and more detail. This one doesn't require it, but is a set of tests trying to fine tune settings for -aa 0 runs to be accurate enough and fast enough compared to a 'traditional' run.

Thanks again,

Subject: Re: [Radiance-general] ripples in my pools...

This artifact appears to be fixed in the CVS head.  It must have been related to sample collision avoidance, which I was doing in a rather ham-fisted way in the first Hessian implementation.  (And yes, it affected results with -aa 0 more noticeably.)  The newer version of ambcomp.c uses a more subtle and successful rejection sampling method, which doesn't bias the original samples.

I put this fix in back in October, but we've been waiting on some unrelated code changes before building the changes into the latest Windows distro.  So, if you're working from that, or you haven't installed the more recent binaries for Linux or Mac, you should do that first.

Cheers,

I've gotten this error on multiple projects, It's visible in rvu, rpict results and images made with rtrace.  It is most apparent on -ab 1 so it comes from either the light through the skylight direct from skyglow (with a clear material) or the first ray through the trans material from a direct source.  Small openings have more pronounced patterning compared with larger openings (large opening at top small opening at bottom: https://goo.gl/photos/stsFoix8s4cE3wk46).  It looks like a diffraction pattern and kind of behaves like one (smaller opening, more prominent), does something in the ray sampling explain why the apertures act like diffraction slits?  would it go away with a really high -ad?  is it also there with ambient caching, but the interpolation smooths it out?

Hi Michael,

Adding back original message, which somehow got lost in my spam folder...

Which version of Radiance are you using?  (I.e., what does "rpict -version" say?)  I found a couple of minor sampling issues in the interreflection code, though I'm not sure if they could cause this effect.  The last fix was a couple of weeks ago, so pretty recent by Radiance standards.

P.S.  If you send me your scene in a private e-mail, I'll have a closer look when I get a chance.

Hi Michael,

Shouldn't really happen, nonetheless perhaps it is possible that there's some weird alias like effect happening with this geometry and the very small ad.

Do your renderings have to be aa 0, and have you tried larger ad values?

Dear list,

I've managed to create unwanted diffuse "ripples" within diffuse pools of light. I'm working with -aa 0 renderings, and having a tough time smoothing things out.

In this example<https://www.dropbox.com/s/fr23tpnv5uqlhxg/clear_section.jpg?dl=0> <https://www.dropbox.com/s/fr23tpnv5uqlhxg/clear_section.jpg?dl=0>,<https://www.dropbox.com/s/fr23tpnv5uqlhxg/clear_section.jpg?dl=0> the diffuse bit of sky component directly below the skylight has subtle ripples of darkness in the pool of light, and also in the bright ceiling above the patch of direct sun...

With a trans material in the skylight<https://www.dropbox.com/s/ptco2powrlhy48x/diffuse_section.jpg?dl=0> <https://www.dropbox.com/s/ptco2powrlhy48x/diffuse_section.jpg?dl=0>, the pattern is even more noticeable, and you can see it mapped onto the walls of the scene as well...

Settings for these runs (which are oversampled x12):
-dp 4096 -ms .14 -ds .1 -dj .9 -dt .05 -dr 3 -ss 16 -st .01 -ab 3 -av 0 0 0 -ar 0 -ad 64 -as 0 -aa 0 -ps 1 -pt .04 -lr 12 -lw 1e-5

Things I've tried with no luck:
- big and small -ar values;  300, 800, 3000 (I recall an old tip from Mark Stock to crank -ar with -aa 0 to get rid of halos?)
- various -ad settings (16, 32 64, 200) while keeping -as 0
-turned on -as with -ad 64 and -as 32
- tried a negative value for -lr
- tried making -lw super small; 1e-10

I'm using the rad program to turn on penumbras - maybe there's something in the -dx, -sx, or -px settings I'm unaware of?

Many thanks for any ideas...

MM

Just a reminder not to include large attachments in posts to any of the Radiance mailing lists.  The mailer can't really handle it.

Also, might I suggest posting this to Unmet Hours <https://unmethours.com/questions/> instead?  The community there is more up on OpenStudio than the general mailing list, and your initial question lacks the appropriate detail needed for a good response.  Unmet Hours offers the opportunity for comments, feedback, and editing of posts.

Message-ID: <23F8AE3E-BE1D-48D4-AA22-EB3C9D74D462@lunet.lboro.ac.uk>

Hi everyone!

I have a doubt on how gendaymtx works. Or better, what?s the difference between the Perez model implementation in gendaymtx and in gendaylit?

I was comparing the output of these two methods, for each hour of the year:
gendaymtx -m 1 GBR_London.wea > London.dmx
gendaylit 1 4 9.5 -a 51.15 -o 0.18 -m -0 -W 178 76 | genskyvec -m 1 >  london_0104h9_rad.skv

And I was expecting to get an identical result, but instead the two data series are somehow different. The data I used for the gendaylit -W option are taken from the same .wea file I used for gendaymtx.

Sorry if you discussed about this previously, I searched a bit in the mailing list but I didn?t find a precise answer.

Thanks a lot!
Eleonora

Hi Eleonora,

The gendaymtx command and gendaylit are separate implementations based on the Perez model with no code in common.  The gendaylit program was developed first, long ago by Jean-Jacques Delaunay, then more recently expanded, updated and improved by Jan Wienold and Wendelin Sprenger.  In contrast, the gendaymtx program was derived a few years ago from C code provided by Ian Ashdown.  The two programs have been spot-checked against each other, but as far as I know, no one has done a thorough comparison of either the methods or the outputs to ensure they behave the same.  In fact, there is some room for interpretation in Perez's model, and numerous places where exceptional values must be caught and dealt with.  Finally, I don't think all the options of gendaylit are included in gendaymtx.

If you can be more specific by checking when, where and by how much your output vectors differ, this would help.  Or at the least, attach the relevant part(s) of your London weather file so we can check ourselves.

Cheers,
-Greg

Hi Eleonora,

I had a presentation at the radiance workshop in Boulder (uff I think 
this was in 2013) - there you can find how gendaylit treats 
"problematic" cases (close to sunrise and sunset).
I assume (and hope), that the differences are only for these hours. The 
core code of gendaylit was checked several times against the publication 
from R. Perez and was not changed in the last 20years.

best,
Jan

Thanks Greg and thanks Jan.

Jan, I had a look at your presentation and tried a comparison with the -i 60 option in gendaylit, but that did not improve much the correlation with gendaymtx.

Over the whole year the differences are really not that big, the coefficient of correlation for the London wea file is 0.97. Only cause I was expecting identical results, I was worried I had left something out in the gendaylit command options, that might have been important.

I attached a scatter plot with the results for the whole year, and a temporal map with the R coefficient over the sky patches for each hour. Some of the ?worst' correlations (still minor) are for high sun angles.

The wea I used was derived from the epw available from the Energy Plus website, using epw2wea (https://energyplus.net/weather-location/europe_wmo_region_6/GBR/GBR_London.Gatwick.037760_IWEC).

Thanks again
Eleonora

Are you sure about the units? 2000W/m2/sr would mean more than 350000 
cd/m2. On the other hand, if the graph would show luminance, then this 
must be just one patch looking to the north? Already for the timestep 
you sent (with low irradiation data) it gives me more than 30000 cd/m2 
close to the sun position (using gendaylit).

Besides the units (I assume you plot cd/m2 for one patch towards the 
north), looking at the graph I think it is necessary to look into that 
deeper to find out the reasons for the deviations. As far as I can see 
this is not caused by the routines we added to gendaylit in order 
prevent problems around sunset/sunrise.

A high r2 does not mean there is no problem- looking at the figure you 
can see a systematic behavior: at high values, gendaymtx delivers higher 
values than gendaylit, for lower ones it is the opposite. The vertical 
line for low gendaylit values could be caused by the sunrise/sunset 
corrections. Especially for the lower values around 2000 there seems 
like a deviation around 40-50% between the two implementations - this is 
definitely too much. Actually the implementation should really deliver 
the same values (except for the sunrise/sunset) - of course 
rounding/variable types and so on could lead to some small deviations, 
but not like this and also not as systematic like this.

cheers

Jan

Hi Jan

Mmm? I used the units as specified in the man page for gendaylit, it says the default output is in W/m2/sr. All the 146 patches are plotted in the graph, at all time steps during daylight time (there are 146 x 4586 points).

Running exactly the same analysis without the sun in the sky description (-s option in both gendaylit and gendaymtx) led to a more symmetric correlation (attached).

Maybe the assignment of the sun contribution to the three nearest sky patches is done slightly differently in genskyvec and in gendaymtx?

Cheers
Eleonora

Jan, I had a look at your presentation and tried a comparison with the -i 60 option in gendaylit, but that did not improve much the correlation with gendaymtx.

Over the whole year the differences are really not that big, the coefficient of correlation for the London wea file is 0.97. Only cause I was expecting identical results, I was worried I had left something out in the gendaylit command options, that might have been important.

I attached a scatter plot with the results for the whole year, and a temporal map with the R coefficient over the sky patches for each hour. Some of the ?worst' correlations (still minor) are for high sun angles.

The wea I used was derived from the epw available from the Energy Plus website, using epw2wea (https://energyplus.net/weather-location/europe_wmo_region_6/GBR/GBR_London.Gatwick.037760_IWEC).

Hi Eleonora,

I had a presentation at the radiance workshop in Boulder (uff I think this was in 2013) - there you can find how gendaylit treats "problematic" cases (close to sunrise and sunset).
I assume (and hope), that the differences are only for these hours. The core code of gendaylit was checked several times against the publication from R. Perez and was not changed in the last 20years.

best,
Jan

If you can be more specific by checking when, where and by how much your output vectors differ, this would help.  Or at the least, attach the relevant part(s) of your London weather file so we can check ourselves.

Hi everyone!

I have a doubt on how gendaymtx works. Or better, what?s the difference between the Perez model implementation in gendaymtx and in gendaylit?

I was comparing the output of these two methods, for each hour of the year:
gendaymtx -m 1 GBR_London.wea > London.dmx
gendaylit 1 4 9.5 -a 51.15 -o 0.18 -m -0 -W 178 76 | genskyvec -m 1 >  london_0104h9_rad.skv

And I was expecting to get an identical result, but instead the two data series are somehow different. The data I used for the gendaylit -W option are taken from the same .wea file I used for gendaymtx.

Sorry if you discussed about this previously, I searched a bit in the mailing list but I didn?t find a precise answer.

Thanks a lot!
Eleonora

Hi guys,

Not sure if gencumulativesky is part of Radiance package or specific to
daysim; but here is my question.

I know the two program(gencumulativesky & gendaymtx) output data in two
different units but I was hoping to get close values for a cumulative
tregenza sky created by
- gencumulativesky +s1 -a 51.15 -o -0.18 -m 0 -p -E -time 1 24 -date 1 1 12
31 GBR_London.Gatwick.037760_IWEC.epw

and adding up columns(hourly data) for each row in gendaymtx matrix(and
later to divide by 1000 as the above gives in kWhr/m2 sr)
- gendaymtx -r 1 -m 1 -c 1 1 1 "GBR_London.Gatwick.037760_IWEC.wea"

Have I made a wrong assumption?

Hi Eleonora,

Yes - if you include the sun then you get that high values for some 
patches. To compare the Perez-sky implementations, you should leave out 
the sun as you did now.

The graph looks better now- even though the spread cannot be explained 
by rounding etc. Now the deviation looks like randomly distributed 
(except the very low values, which is the sunset/sunrise issue).
One possible explanation for the spread would be that one of the tools 
gendaymtx or genskyvec is using the value in the middle of the patch 
where the other one is using an average of the patch. Since the Perez 
distribution is non-linear, those values could differ slightly in both 
directions. But I'm not deep enough into that, maybe someone else can 
explain it. If both tools are doing the same, then I have no idea at the 
moment where this deviation (rough guess: up to 10% ) is coming from. 
For a systematic error (like a mistake in one of the implementations) it 
looks too randomly distributed.

cheers

Jan

Subject: [Radiance-general] RAYPATH problems
Message-ID: <CAJMyNLcAm8qj9jwESSrnCv64=Z7bsfgWU4u6qPwbHmNU6hB2Jg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Everyone: I learned a little unix to be able to work with Radiance
(for some upcoming projects that require me to reconstruct very specific
lighting conditions), but I am running into some problems:

I followed the instructions for installing Radiance on Mac OSx (10.11.6)

created a file ~/.bashrc with the following arguments:
export PATH=/usr/local/radiance/bin:$PATH
export RAYPATH=.:/usr/local/radiance/lib

I followed Greg W's Radiance Ch. 1 tutorial and successfully modeled a
sphere on a pedestal and in a room (exciting).

However, when I tried to do more sophisticated work (the Image Mapping
tutorials by Axel Jacobs in the Radiance Cookbook), I received an error
that "picture.cal" does not exist.

I ran "ls -la /usr/local/radiance/lib" and noticed that picture.cal was
missing. After poking around, I discovered another path to /radiance/lib
and then ran "ls -la /opt/rad4/radiance-5.0.a.12-Darwin/usr/local/radiance/lib"
and found picture.cal as well as many other files not in the original
directory path above. I copied picture.cal into the directory for the
RAYPATH, but still received the error.

Anyway, I tried re-setting RAYPATH to
"/opt/rad4/radiance-5.0.a.12-Darwin/usr/local/radiance/lib"
(as well as =.:/opt/rad4/radiance-5.0.a.12-Darwin/usr/local/radiance/lib)
but I still received an error that picture.cal was missing. I finally
figured out a very kludgy way to get the missing files in radiance/lib to
work (by copying them into the current working directory), but I want to
get the RAYPATH working properly.

Does anyone have advice/help?

Thank you very much, David

Hi David,

It's difficult to say for certain, but you should know that altering your .bashrc file only affects the next open Terminal window.  It doesn't change the RAYPATH setting in the shell you already have running.

You should open a new Terminal window and enter "echo $RAYPATH" to make sure your environment setting is in effect.  If it is, and you can read the associated directory, then something else must be wrong.

Cheers,
-Greg

Check that picture.cal is indeed used as "picture.cal" and not as
"./picture.cal". The leading "./" will only search in the current scene
directory and ignore the RAYPATH settings.

You can also type

    source ./bashrc

in the terminal to reread the configuration and apply any changes you made
to the current bash session.

I recently did an NREL install. Just had a look and picture.cal.. plink.cal? the woodxxx.cal are not included in the library? at least I cannot find them.

Hi Everyone:
Thanks for the tips; much appreciated.

When I type in echo $RAYPATH, it returns  ".:/usr/local/radiance/lib"
When I type in echo $PATH, it returns "
/usr/local/radiance/bin:/usr/local/radiance/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/X11/bin"

picture.cal is entered properly in the .rad file (no directory paths in
front of the command)

Sorry this is giving you so much trouble. I still remember the excitement
I felt when I saw the Tutorial 0 scene appear in my rvu window the first
time! 

What *nix are you using, and which version of the Radiance installer did
you use? Also, did you follow the advice and either a) try the commands in
a new terminal window after making the changes to your ~/.bashrc, or, b)
type 'source ~/.bashrc? in the current terminal window?

Subject: [Radiance-general] RAYPATH problems 5
Message-ID: <CAJMyNLf=HVD-tBt8=1107H4O=j01rrKsnDccHOSO6hor+ULqbg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Everyone:

Thank you for your help. I just saw this message from R.G. and I now tried
source ~/.bashrc and the RAYPATH appears to work. So, should I change the
~/.profile file instead for a more permanent fix?

Thanks again, David

If the ?source? trick worked, then yours is already a more permanent fix.
It means that the changes you made to your .bashrc were applied to the
current terminal (and that they seem to work). Confirm this by opening a
new terminal and trying the radiance commands again. Should work fine, as
the new terminal will read the .bashrc file on startup. The .profile file
is simply another place you can put these kinds of environment statements;
it works much the same way as .bashrc does, except it is more general
(i.e., it?s used for other shells besides bash).

Subject: [Radiance-general] Problem with Trans material
Message-ID: <CA+pbveGw6otYzb-Y6SGnkYehh2=812rirxPvVESkmFaNd3Avbw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

I am trying to generate a BSDF of a complex translucent facade component.
One of the materials in the model is a fabric and I'm trying to simulate
its optical behavior using a Trans material, however I have some problems.
Creating a BSDF of the trans material (you can see the material definition
below), I have obtained a particular angular transmission behavior as
showed in the pictures below. There is a particular increment between 0?
and 30? of the incidence angle, instead i was expected something similar to
the dashed lines in the graphs. Is it normal to have this angular
transmission trend? If not, how can I fix this problem?

[image: Immagine incorporata 1]

Trans material
void trans Fabric
0
0
7 0.8 0.8 0.8 0.01 0 0.45 0

BSDF:
genBSDF -n 4 -c 4000 -dim 0.299 0.338 0.373 0.429 -0.018 0 -r -ab 10
trans_test_tr3.rad
For the test the material geometry is a rectangle.


Thanks in advance.
Best

Hi Andrea,

I don't think trans material is the right way to model fabrics, since 
fabrics change their behavior depending on the angle of incidence. And 
since you don't have an option to model an angular behavior with trans 
it is better to use another material type. One option doing it is using 
BRTDfunc and "control" the direct transmitted part via a cal file. 
Typical fabrics have a very constant total transmission until 75? and 
then a drop similar as a glass. This can be modelled with an additional 
glass layer with a very low refraction index. The direct transmission 
depends on the fabric type and weaving process - typically you have 
cut-off angles for the direct transmission between 60-75?. This behavior 
you can model with a cal file. I've done that recently for a big 
simulation study as basis for the new European daylight standard and you 
can come close to the real behavior of the fabrics with this modeling 
approach. We compared BTDF measurements with the model.

good luck

Jan

Hi Andrea,
I just ran your BSDF command and got a BSDF with 35.6% direct-hemispherical
transmission for all incident angles.
How are you calculating the transmission from the BSDF file? Can you send
me your BSDF file in a separate email?
Andy

Hi Andrea,

It is important to use the latest CVS head when generating Klems distributions with genBSDF.  David Geisler-Moroder and Christian Knoflach discovered a bug in the corrections for Klems solid angles built into wrapBSDF, which is called by genBSDF.  These errors are on the order of what you are seeing, so if you are using a distribution built before November of 2016, this could well be your problem.

Best,
-Greg

Subject: [Radiance-general] What is the default setting for rtrace
Message-ID: <AAD4C5B99DCE7E4EA05016103A8F236B066B0FA5@E-AEXMBX01.global.arup.com>

Hi all,

I am wondering what is the default value for each parameter we can set in rtrace.
Looking at website (http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/man_html/rtrace.1.html), I only can find what that parameter means.
Does anyone know where I can find those information?
If no, could you tell me what is the default value for -dr since I was wondering how this parameter affect to the daylight calculation with reflector.

Thank you.
Katsuya

Run "rtrace -defaults"

This works also for rpict, rvu, and rcontrib.

Subject: [Radiance-general] genBSDF and rcontrib errror on Windows 10
Message-ID: <AM4PR0501MB2194392C5EF71A155E19823E81F90@AM4PR0501MB2194.eurprd05.prod.outlook.com>

Hi Radiance Online,

I have been getting a recurring error while trying to run genBSDF through the git bash console on a Windows 10 system. I have searched through quite a few forums, and of these Radiance-Online repository?s, however no-one seems to have had quite the same error. I get the following error:

jamessheldon at ATELIERTENXXXX MINGW64 ~
$ genBSDF.pl C:/ladybug/Hyderabad/100mm_shading_screen/MSH2RADFiles/blinds.rad > C:/ladybug/Hyderabad/100mm_shading_screen/MSH2RADFiles/blinds_2.xml
rcontrib: system - cannot find function file "klems_full.cal": Invalid argument
C:/ladybug/BSDF/genBSDF.WPQU9v/behind.dat: cannot load matrix
C:\Radiance\bin\rmtxop.exe: operation failed on 'C:/ladybug/BSDF/genBSDF.WPQU9v/behind.dat'
Failure running rmtxop at /c/Radiance/bin/genBSDF.pl line 463.

I have changed the temp directory away from the traditional path variable in-case I didn?t have the right run-permissions for that folder. On our system, the C:/ladybug has read, write and execute permissions. Clearly this didn?t address the problem. My PATH and RAYPATH environment variables are as echoed:

jamessheldon at ATELIERTENXXXX MINGW64 ~
$ echo $PATH
/c/Users/jamessheldon/bin:/mingw64/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/mingw64/bin:/usr/bin:/c/Users/jamessheldon/bin:/c/Radiance/bin:/c/Program Files (x86)/Panda Security/WaAgent/Common:/c/Users/jamessheldon/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python35-32/Scripts:/c/Users/jamessheldon/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python35-32:/c/Radiance/bin:/c/DAYSIM/bin:/c/Accelerad/bin:/c/Strawberry/c/bin:/c/Strawberry/perl/bin:.:/usr/bin/vendor_perl:/usr/bin/core_perl

jamessheldon at ATELIERTENXXXX MINGW64 ~
$ echo $RAYPATH
.;C:\Accelerad\lib; C:\Radiance\lib;

I also receive the same error when trying to run the accelerad version of genBSDF. I am struggling to find a way of progressing with this error, as we get no further feedback from an error console or event viewer. Thanks in advance for any assistance ?

Warm Regards,
