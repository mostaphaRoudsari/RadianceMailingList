Subject: [Radiance-general] Emp: Another Radiance-based calculation engine
Message-ID: <CAF-iH4L-PLAw81enmZjiKdyFpkuy=2SzX644h3WU7iwAhOOc_g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello List,

As some of you might now, I have been developing Groundhog
<https://github.com/GroundhogLighting/Groundhog> for a few years now. Even
if its use has not spread too much, my students have help me improve the
usability, fixing bugs and understanding my users. Thanks to those
improvements, some Groundhog users have started to create models much more
large and complex than those it has been tested at, causing that an
important part of the processing time is not due to the Radiance
calculation, but by the pre and post processing of results (i.e.
Triangulation of workplanes, analysis of the hourly data on each of the
3892 sensors in a workplane).

In order to solve this problem, I re-writing the calculation processes of
Groundhog in C++. This re-writing has allowed me to re-think how things
were done, thus I quickly realized that this could become a separate
project that can be reused by others. This reusable C++ library is called
Emp_core <https://github.com/GroundhogLighting/emp_core>, is now as Open
Source on Github.

The testing of this engine is done using a program called simply Emp
<https://github.com/GroundhogLighting/emp>, which I expect to ship with the
next big release of Groundhog. Emp is a Lua wrapper to Emp_core, that tries
to provide Radiance with some features I think would improve it. Those are:

   - *Efficient out-of-the-box multicore processing across programs* (i.e.
   call several RTRACE or RCONTRIB threads at the same time)
      - *Out of the box script optimization, eliminating redundant tasks*
   (i.e. do not create two octrees for calculating the Daylight Factor and the
   Annual Illuminance... one is enough... but please reuse the ambient files
   when possible)
      - *Cross platform script-based model generation* (i.e. do not rely on
   Unix programs to generate complex geometry... on the contrary, allow
   including trigonometric functions, randomness, and more, in all platforms)
      - *Read and write several file formats* (i.e. allow me to draw my
   models in some modern 3D modelling tool)
      - *Simple automation of those tasks required on a daily basis*, so I
   can work faster and avoid errors (i.e. I do not want to write a script
   every time I want to perform a Climate Based Daylight Simulation)
      - *Cross platform consistency* (i.e. should I write rcalc -e "$1 =
   $1+$2" or rcalc -e '$1 = $1+$2' ?)
      - *Workplane interpretation as geometry, not a grid of points* (i.e.
   if I want to know the Spatial Daylight Autonomy of a workplane, I can
   probably describe a polygon that encolses it... but I do not want to write
   every point where the illuminance is measured)
      - *Post-processing capabilities* (i.e. my workplane contains 4,528
   sensors... I do not want to know, nor write down, the illuminance of each
   of them on each of the 8,760 hours of the year. Just return the CBD metric
   I asked for)
      - Do not create 3,125 files, please (i.e. there are several files I
   am not interested in, which are just intermediate results... please delete
   them afterwards)

These improvements are possible thanks to Intel TBB library, and some
triangulation libraries (for meshing workplanes) available in Github as
well.

As mentioned earlier, Emp_core is meant to allow integration to other CAD
tools (I am looking at you, Revit) and other formats (ESPr and EnergyPlus,
probably?). Emp, on the other hand, is meant to allow scripting. It is
possible to use scripts to just generate models, or to solving them.

If anyone is interested in knowing more, please let me know. All this is in
early stages of development, so it is still quickly changing.

Best,
