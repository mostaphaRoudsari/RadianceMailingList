Hi Bob,

Thanks for letting me know.  I have reinstated the link, but the  
hdrgen program has been subsumed as part of HDRcapOSX.tar.gz in the  
same directory, linked to the front page.

I have taken the opportunity to compile hdrgen as a universal binary,  
and added the "hdrcvt" command-line utility for converting between  
HDR formats.

-Greg

Subject: [HDRI] Cheap WLAN controller for Digital Cameras...
Message-ID: <8AB012A5-E117-4E89-8F2E-EB432B439013@mab3d.com>

I'm not sure if this is "old news" or not, but here is a link to  
Helmut Dersch's latest "experiment" - a bargain basement solution for  
controlling a camera over USB, but without a laptop. The premise is  
also that it utilizes WiFi and a browser-based Linux controller so  
the true "host" can be nearly anywhere.

http://webuser.hs-furtwangen.de/~dersch/gphoto/remote.html

I can imagine situations where time-lapse HDRs could be generated if  
either HDRcapOSX was recompiled for Linux, or if PTP camera control  
could somehow be "passed through" the Linux controller from an OSX  
remote system. Many other possibilities for the slightly more Linux-y  
folk...

-Mark

This discussion probably belongs on the HDRI mailing list, as opposed  
to radiance-general, so I'm cross-posting.

You might mention in your postings that Photosphere can output JPEG- 
HDR images suitable for web sites, which people who use Photosphere  
will then see as full HDR images.  You can even e-mail them -- there  
are quite a few examples buried on my site, such as:

TuolumneRiver4_lA64.jpg
	http://www.anyhere.com/gward/snaps/hawaii05/img/OutriggerLobby_lC7E.jpg

GrandCanyon3_lC21.jpg
	http://www.anyhere.com/gward/snaps/GrandCanyon2006/img/Sedona3_l1AF.jpg

Unfortunately, you just have to dig through my recent snapshots to  
find them...  Also, not everyone has Photosphere, being as more than  
half(!) the computing world is still using Windows, but the JPEGs  
view as tone-mapped images on other software, and you can download  
free converter programs from BrightSide Technologies to get you  
between JPEG and Radiance format images:

	http://www.brightsidetech.com/products/process.php

Since Photoshop CS2 (and I believe Photomatrix) can output Radiance  
format images, you can go from there to JPEG-HDR using the BrightSide  
conversion tools, and back again on the receiving end.  Hopefully,  
we'll have a plug-in for Photoshop before too long.

Special Issue on High Dynamic Range Imaging

High dynamic range imaging (HDRI) is an emerging technology, which has the 
potential to bring a new revolution in digital imaging. In HDRI, the image 
files record the actual colour and dynamic range of the real world scene 
rather than the limited gamut and dynamic range of the monitor or other 
reproduction media. This means that image processing, manipulation, 
display, recognition and other operations will no longer be limited by the 
number of bits used to represent each pixel. Therefore, HDRI will have 
widespread applications in digital cinema, digital photography, computer 
games, etc., and will open up many new possibilities, including 
dramatically improving the visual realism of digital photographs and 
videos, enabling the development of more accurate computational vision 
techniques, etc. Many in academic and industry have advocated that the 
future of digital photography and video is high dynamic range imaging. It 
is anticipated that in the next decade, the imaging industry will 
inevitably move to HDRI which will affect all aspects of the imaging 
pipeline, from capture (sensor, camera), to storage (compression coding) to 
reproduction (rendering, tone mapping, printing and display). New image 
processing and computational vision algorithms will also be developed 
around this new emerging imaging paradigm.

This special issue will highlight new research directions and the latest 
technological advancement in high dynamic range imaging and video by 
collecting papers in all relevant areas of HDRI. We invite researchers and 
practitioners to submit their original unpublished work to this special 
issue. We solicit papers dealing with high dynamic range imaging subtopics 
drawn from all stages of the high dynamic range imaging pipeline. This 
includes, but is not limited to, the following topics

?    Capture devices
?    Multi-exposure techniques
?    Response curve recovery
?    Noise
?    Ghost removal
?    Encoding for images and video
?    File formats for images and video
?    Applications of HDRI
?    Image-based lighting
?    Dynamic range reduction
?    HDR display devices
?    Validation of techniques and algorithms
?    Colour science
?    Colour appearance modeling
