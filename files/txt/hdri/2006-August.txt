The web version of the New York Times has an article about HDRI at:

http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/03/technology/03basics.html

It is basic and general, but I was surprised that it does not mention
Photosphere at all.
(maybe because there's no Windows version?)
anyway, I thought you might be interested, and perhaps someone more able
than me can write them to correct/expand the info?

Hi Santiago,

I did see this article, thanks.  I was annoyed that they didn't  
mention Photosphere or even HDRshop, but then neither are really  
commercial programs, and the article was clearly targeted at a more  
mainstream audience.  Judy Lai is in fact working on documenting  
Photosphere, and I have another friend working on a port for Windows  
and Linux.  So, maybe it will be commercial, one day!  In any case, I  
plan to continue to distribute a free version for the Mac, since it's  
a basic bias of mine...

How are things with you?  Do you think you'll make it to the next  
Radiance workshop in September?
-Greg

Hi Kirk,

I personally thought it was huge, fun, interesting and exhausting all  
a the same time. Pretty much par for the course at SIGGRAPH...

The full-day HDRI session on Sunday was really packed (despite being 8 
+ hours) and had some interesting presentations of opinions, research  
and (games) industry uses, and the birds-of-a-feather was also well  
attended. I never got my press-pass for the conference (they've upped  
the requirements for what is "press"), so I was prevented from taking  
photos during the sessions and at the show floor... I did get some  
HDR shots around Boston, and I can post a link to those soon.

Some of the highlights of the conference (for me, a non-researcher)  
were:

- Finally got to meet Greg Ward in person, but he was always too  
swamped with groupies to have a real conversation with. ;-)

- Streaming HDR video (using the new MPEG-HDR codec) shown on the  
Brightside monitors!

- Well, actually seeing any HDR image on the Brightside monitors was  
just too cool for words. Helge thinks something similar will be mass- 
market available in just 2 years thanks to display industry trends!

- Erum Khan's presentation on Image-based Material Editing (on HDR  
images):
http://graphics.cs.ucf.edu/ekhan/project_ibme.htm

- I had a great opportunity to talk to Erik Reinhard about (among  
other things) what passes for "HDR" and tonemapping on Flickr (and  
that NYTimes article highlights this as well).

- The realization that lots of interested and talented people have  
"heard of" HDRI, but there really isn't a central gathering/ rallying  
point for people bridging the gap between research and commercial  
implementations.

- To this end, I talked to 5 vendors of photographic hardware and  
software to actively encourage them to add HDR capture/ input support  
to their imaging products. (Again, they've heard of it, but didn't  
know all of the immediately marketable uses and sales angles.)


Naturally, this is only what one guy saw while wandering from Sunday  
to Wednesday. I never did meet up with Jack or Mark from this list,  
but I'm sure they were at some of the same sessions.

Hi Greg,

Great news about Photosphere (especially about the future free versions:)
And on the same subject, the last improvements were amazing. Thank you for
that. The false color images are great, I've been using them a lot. I just
wish there was a choice of a logarithmic scale.

As for me, I'm afraid I won't be able to get to this year's workshop. I
really am sorry since I wanted very much to get your tutorial on rtcontrib.
And the other titles seem very interesting also. And I'll miss meeting
everyone, for sure. I hope you all have a great time as usual.

Santiago

Hi Santiago,

The false color option in Photosphere does do logarithmic mappings --  
just specify a non-zero lower limit, and the scale becomes  
logarithmic.  (This is the default if the "Auto" box is checked --  
will be spelled out in the documentation, eventually!)

Sorry we'll miss you in Leicester!

Hi Santiago and All,

I've just had a look at this article, and the images are
quite obviously created with a program called Photomatix.
This program combines multiple exposures, and also has a
tone reproduction algorithm built-in.

Unfortunately, most people on Flickr using HDR are using
this program. My annoyance stems from the fact that the
tone mapping algorithm produces very unnatural results, and
is about the poorest algorithm that I know for dynamic range
reduction. It is very easy to recognize Photomatix output as
a result --- it looks too compressed with too much local
contrast.

The apologetic comments at the end of the NYC article about
the unnatural look of the Photomatix output makes no sense to
me. There is no good reason to offer such a poor tone mapper
as the only choice in any program.

As a result, the Flickr community is starting to equate HDR
with non-photorealistic rendering, which in my view is very
undesirable. The NYC article is not helping in that respect
either, as it does not present a balanced view of the state
of the art in HDR.

High dynamic range imaging is an exciting technology for many,
as it allows us to take pictures and do image processing that
we couldn't do before. However, I feel that Photomatix, in
combination with its apparent, but undeserved popularity on
Flickr, is doing more harm than good to help establish HDR as
a useful technology.

Right, that's me finished venting.

Cheers,
Erik

Photomatix is really very limited - I think the gallery images they  
show are not representative of typical output one can expect.   
Obviously tone mapping is a key ingredient in using HDR images on  
standard displays and print media.  I have found the tone mapping  
algorithms discussed in the text, and included on the accompanying  
DVD, of the HDRI book to be a great asset in exploring tone mapping.  
Anyone who is interested in tone mapping should really take the time  
to read the chapters in the book dedicated to this topic.   I am  
especially intrigued by the "photographic" tone mapping algorithm -  
in fact it inspired me to read all three of Ansel Adams' classic  
works on his photographical philosophy (The Camera, The Negative and  
The Print).  Implementing the Zone System in HDR tone-mapping is an  
interesting approach, especially with a basis on the neutral 17% gray  
card (Zone 5).  From a Radiance standpoint, is this 17% gray card in  
the macbeth.cal file?  It would be interesting to include it in  
renderings and use the Zone System with the photographic_tm tone  
mapping operator to explore various variations on the original, high- 
bit rendering output.

Thanks Eric!

Hi Erik,

You already know my opinion of Flickr and the over-Photomatixed  
results, but I see this article and the exposure and popularity of  
this "effect" on Flickr as both an expected and not entirely negative  
thing. The basics are that in the greater world of photo hobbyists  
(which Flickr represents) no one knows *what* HDR is, aside from the  
fact the letters mean "High Dynamic Range" and that Adobe put it in  
Photoshop CS2 and some other companies sell software to do something  
similar. Keep in mind these same people also have *no idea* what all  
can be done with HDR.

I would guess that the vast majority of photographers (pro, hobbyist,  
and "holiday snappers") only know what Adobe said in their marketing  
of this "new feature in CS2," or what the adventurous ones read on  
Luminouslandscape.com, and that is roughly that "HDR images can  
contain a greater range of tones and colors than other computer  
images, but it cannot be displayed on your monitor or manipulated  
much at this time." And most likely these same folks have *not* been  
struggling with the lack of range in "regular" photography - pros  
carefully choose their lighting conditions, and hobbyists frequently  
just don't notice. So the idea that HDR capture and processing are  
useful for extending the visual range of an image ends up getting  
lost when these same consumers see "well-tonemapped" results that  
look not too different from the original(s) or not too different from  
other photos they've seen. It is a lot of work to get what most  
people (I've talked to anyway) see as a very small visual difference.

Plus, in a content-competitive social community like Flickr (or even  
the NYTimes) you have to do something dramatically different to stand  
out. Pushing all the sliders in Photomatix "to 11" to get a wild,  
painterly and oversaturated compression of dynamic range is certainly  
different, and when people ask "how'd you do that" they can say "with  
that cool new HDR thing."  If all Photomatix output looked just like  
Photoshop's tonemapping, or just like a nice, well-exposed photo,  
very few would ask "how'd you do that" and HDR very well might not be  
mentioned in the New York Times at all. Again, I strongly believe  
that this is because the subtleties in a resulting "photographic"  
tonemapped image (as well as the greater impact on image-making and  
photography) is not as immediately noticeable to most people.

Finally, I think this "Flickr abuse" is somewhat typical of what  
happens when a "new" technology is first put into the hands of the  
mass-market;  people naturally try to push all the buttons and see  
what lights up, and in the end they decide what they like and what  
becomes popular for a time. I've watched this same process repeatedly  
over 20 years of "3D images" being publicized, and even now I don't  
think that a shiny car in a white void is any better than a chrome  
sphere on tiles, and "3D" is just beginning to be used judiciously.  
Of course I don't think what's on Flickr "is HDR" by any stretch of  
the imagination, but it *is* the most visually distinct result of an  
HDR process that people can access today. The true aesthetics of the  
process and technology are some time from shaking themselves out (and  
the use of HDR in video games is just another example of this).

The only suggestion to alleviate your particular frustration with  
Flickr and Photomatix would be to write to the makers of Photomatix  
(and Photoshop, et al) and ask them to include some of the existing  
different tonemapping methods in their next release. Then at least  
your tools would also be in the hands of the people on Flickr.

-Mark

BTW, you might obviously note that my opinions are those of an image- 
creator interested in the application of HDRI, not a researcher  
committed to its technical development and understanding. I feel the  
same need to vent when something I've created is grossly misused or  
misunderstood.

Hello Eric,

I also seldomly use the Photomatix algorithm for the same reason. I had 
several talks with the Author of the software about this and i think it 
should be mentioned that the current beta version includes a new global

Hi Erik,

I would be interested to know whether your rating of the tone mapper offered in Photomatix as poor 
is based on a comparative survey. If such a survey has been conducted, what were the criteria used 
for rating the algorithms? What was the background and number of participants of the survey? And 
which settings have been used for producing the Photomatix results?

Please note that only a fraction of the photos tagged with HDR at Flickr have been produced with 
Photomatix. There are other software offering tone mapping capabilities, and of course Photoshop 
CS2 is the most well-known and used by photographers. I believe you are grossly overestimating the 
popularity of Photomatix. Furthermore, most of the Flickr's images produced with Photomatix have 
been post-processed in other imaging software, and therefore are not the direct output of its tone 
mapper. 

Photomatix offers user controls to parametrize the algorithm to the user's personal taste, and many 
at Flickr seem to like to dramatize the effect with settings that are far away from the default values. 
The approach of Photomatix is to let the user decide what is best for his/her photos, and not have it 
imposed by the engineer who designed the algorithm. Photoshop CS2 apparently follows the same 
approach, as its "Local Adaptation" HDR Conversion method allows a great deal of control over the 
mapping, better than with Photomatix in fact. 

Why should a software be blamed for allowing photographers to adjust the settings and produce 
tone mapped images that specialists in HDR imaging consider non-photorealistic? 

Photomatix is intended for photographers and not for 3D artists or other categories of users. 
Photographers in general do not wish to produce photorealistic images. They are not interested for 
instance in adding motion blur to make their images look photorealistic, as motion blur is precisely 
what photographers want to avoid. The same applies to HDR and tone mapping: most photographers 
are not interested in taking several exposures for HDR if the final result is going to be a 
"photorealistic" image that looks like a dull Low Dynamic Range photograph.

This is a very interesting statement, especially in light of 3D  
modelers and renderers who are trying to produce "photorealistic"  
images by using HDR photographs as radiance maps and reflectance  
maps.  Fascinating philosophical point of view!  I guess it comes  
down to one's definition of what is "photorealistic".

Also shows how out of touch they are. They will represent a hurdle that
everyone involved in evolving the HDR technology will have to deal with from
this point on, thank you Photomatix ;)

The quoted statement makes little sense to me as well, but perhaps  
for different reasons.

"Photorealism" is a term that (I thought) means something "looks like  
a [traditional] photograph."  Of course, when anyone picks up a  
camera, they already have understood and accepted that the image it  
produces will (most likely) be a 2D, monocular view of the scene that  
is cropped by a rectangular sensor/ film plane, and subject to the  
technology of the capture method. The resulting image looks nothing  
like what a human would see at the time, but many people still enjoy  
photographs (!) because they communicate part of what was seen at the  
time by triggering the mind to have a reaction. Good photographers  
heighten the reaction to an image by choice of subject, framing,  
lighting, processing, etc. This is all a part of the subjective  
notion of "photorealism," and we see where this idea is stretched  
everyday in bleached out colors in car ads, heavily retouched fashion  
models, or even cropping a mother-in-law from a vacation photo.

What people have been trying to do since the inception of photography  
(the darkened room with a hole in one wall, or "camera obscura") is  
capture *some* of "what is seen by the eyes" at a specific time and  
place, and HDRI is trying to advance and redefine what is seen as a  
"traditional photograph" by capturing *more* of what is seen by the  
human eye (among other things). So, in my opinion, today's  
photographic HDRI (and tone-mapping) is quite "non-photorealistic."  
Isn't that the point? To reduce some of the limitations of photography?

Anyway, this is all "a storm in a teacup" to me. Every image that  
goes into or out of my computer is subject to my whims and the  
technology I have access to. I would imagine the same is true for  
most everyone else who takes photos - you post an image you  
personally think looks good. Plus, I've seen some truly awful results  
from other TMOs put into powerpoint presentations to show what is a  
"good result," but my idea of "awful" is just where the author's  
opinion departs from mine, as far as aesthetics are concerned. I  
don't see their example image or TMO as an obstacle to HDRI and  
tonemapping - next year (or next month) there will hopefully be a new  
advancement and maybe myself and many others will find a use for this  
new research as well... when it gets into our tools, that is.

You are right. I should have made it clear in what sense I used the term "photorealistic" here. By 
"photorealistic", I was referring to the attempt to mimic the effects of camera limitations in order to 
make an image (a computer generated one for instance) look as if it had been taken with a camera. 

If you ask a photographer what the biggest limitation of today's camera is, he will probably answer 
without any hesitation: dynamic range. So, because of this limitation, a photo of any high or medium 
dynamic range scene will end up with blown out highlights or undistinguishable shadows or both. 
Therefore, an image that does not show this limitation, i.e. that reproduces the details in highlights 
and shadows of the original HDR scene the same way a human observer had seen it, such image 
does not look like what people expect a photograph to look like. In this sense, such image is not 
photorealistic.

Photographers are not happy with the limitation of their camera, and this is what I meant by 
"photographers do not wish to produce photorealistic images". Photographers would like that their 
camera were able to reproduce that beautiful HDR landscape that captivated their eyes, but they 
know the camera will not collaborate... 

This is why the promises of HDR photography are so exciting for photographers. They are all looking 
forward for a camera that will give them directly an HDR picture. (Please note that I am intentionally 
using the term "picture" instead of "image" here, to make it clear that what photographers are 
interested in is the final tone mapped output and not the "raw" 32-bit HDR image itself.) 

By saying "HDR picture" a photographer would thus mean a tone mapped HDR image. Such image is 
technically speaking an LDR image, but for a photographer it reproduces the high dynamic range 
captured, and is thus referred to as HDR. A photographer will consider such tone mapped image as a 
good "HDR picture" if it succeeds in reproducing the highlights and shadows as he/she saw them at 
capture time. If the tone mapped image looks like a "photorealistic" blown-out image instead, it 
won't be considered "HDR" for a photographer. 

Let's take this example to illustrate that
http://www.hdrsoft.com/images/grandcanal/tm.html

Most people looking at the above tone mapped image (especially when they are not photographers 
themselves) will typically react this way: 
"This picture does not look natural. It looks more like a painting than a photograph". 

However, if you tell that to Jacques Joffre, the photographer who took the bracketed shots for this 
picture, he will reply: 
"But I was there and this is exactly what I saw! It is precisely because it looked so beautiful that I 
decided to shoot this scene. I would not have done it if it had looked like a dull photograph."

I won't claim that the tone mapper of Photomatix always succeeds in closely reproducing what the 
photographer saw. This depends on the image and the dynamic range, sometimes it works very well, 
sometimes it does not, and other tone mapping operators -or simply blending the original 
exposures- will work better. And of course, a user can always intentionally choose settings that 
make the image look "special" and far away from what it was in reality. But the same can be done 
with any TMO that offers sufficient user control, it is unfair to blame only Photomatix for that. 

My point is just that, in my opinion, we should not rate a tone mapping algorithm on how 
photorealistic its output is perceived to be, but rather on how well it reproduces what a human 
observer has seen.

Folks,

I just used the Linux version of the hdrgen program, and there 
appears to be a systematic error somwhere.

My first attempts were handheld, and alignment always failed. My 
attempt today was using a tripod in my living room, and the 
alignment error is very regular:

This was done with:
hdrgen dscn68??.jpg -o test.pic -r cam.rsp

Is there anything I can do about this?

Hi Mark,

I had something similar occur, however the scene was very different. In 
my case there was a cloud moving past a building. With automatic 
alignment turned on (default behavior) I got a result similar to yours. 
It seemed like the program was tracking on the brightest "source" in the 
set of exposures. I wonder during the time that you took your exposures 
was there a big change in the daylight coming into the space? What 
happens if you turn alignment off (-a included in the command line)?

Or alternatively, are you sure that you are passing only the exposures 
you want to hdrgen? I have done this in the past where I will take a set 
of exposures and part way through shooting the set I realize that I 
screwed something up so I will start over and in the process may change 
the camera position. However I forget to delete the previous set from 
the folder, so they get passed along to hdrgen as well.
