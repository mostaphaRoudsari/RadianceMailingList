Message-ID: <B7FC338D-00D0-43E7-9509-9DB978581900@mac.com>

does anybody know of anyone having measured surface reflectance (r  
table, illuminance / luminance coefficients) trough HDR imaging?

we are trying to set up such a system but  just wanted to double  
check before inventing the wheel, again :-)

thanks a lot
G.

Giulio,
I believe Marilyne Andersen at MIT has developed a method of measure
material surface characteristic. References listed below.

a look into the HDR-bible (ISBN: 0125852630) and on Paul Debevec's

Hi Guilio,

I haven't done this myself, but I see no reason why it wouldn't work,  
at least for Lambertian (or nearly Lambertian) surfaces.  You just  
need a suitable reflectance standard to set in the plane of the  
surface -- any of the commercially available gray cards would do.  To  
avoid issues with variability in the incident light, you should  
probably average surface values all around the gray card, rather than  
to one side of it, or cut a hole in the gray card and do the  
reverse.  People have also used polarizing filters to separate out  
the specular component if there is one.

If you can get a sample of your material, a scanner combined with  
macbethcal works even better.

-Greg

A big thanks to all of you!

Our idea is quite simple.
there are some angle related problems and optical issues but all is  
under control at the moment, I believe we are going to the right  
direction and we will be able to get an idea of the error related to  
the measurement.
your words are encouraging :-)
just now we have a lot of work to do :-)
will update if something happens..
ciao!
G.

Hello Greg

                 Based on your experience on ghost removal methods, which do
think are good implementations?

Tom

Hi Thomas,

What other methods are there besides the one in Photosphere?  I'm not  
up on other people's software, but I hadn't heard of other commercial  
or free packages that did this.  Do you have some results to point us  
to?  Or are you talking about exposure alignment methods?

Just curious.
-Greg

There is a manual approach in FDR Tools, as seen in the third  
tutorial movie on this site:
http://fdrtools.com/tutorials/tutorials_e.php

In my opinion quite tedious, and wasteful with the unmoving image parts.

best regards,
-Christian

I was actually refering to papers, sorry for the lack of clarity. I have
used FDRTools (as Blochi pointed out is a bit over kill when no moving
objects are not present) when needed, as well as other apps like HDRShop and
CS2.

Tom.
