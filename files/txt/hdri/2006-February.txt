Hi Mark,

The Canon SDK is supposedly compatible with versions 10.2 and later.   
I think this is a problem with Code Warrior, which is probably  
restricted to 10.3 and later.  Not much I can do about that,  
unfortunately...

P.S.  I can understand being one OS release behind, but two?

Hi Mark,

Before you go upgrading your system, you should double-check that  
others are having the same problem.  (Any 10.3.x users out there who  
can't get it working?)  It may be that it didn't get installed/ 
configured correctly.

As you know, I have had the 10.4 install disc on my desk for a while  
now, so with this dangling before me I just couldn't postpone it any  
longer. After some housecleaning, maintenance and the usual backup I  
successfully upgraded to 10.4.4.

Surprise! Your HDRcapOSX.app worked right away... (okay, there was a  
connection hiccup at first, but I power-cycled the DSLR and then it  
was golden). Pretty minimal, but it got my tethered Canon clicking  
away in no time. I have some questions about the operation, but that  
will be a separate email.

Something I also noticed when I unarchived the TAR in 10.4.4 was that  
a particular file (CanonHDRcap.app.BdF) was mis-named on extraction  
in 10.3 and 10.2, resulting in *two* "CanonHDRcap.app" files (one of  
which would be appended with a ".1" or "_1" depending on the  
extraction method).

Thinking the extraction might be the culprit, I copied this 10.4  
extracted set of files to 10.2 and had the same old error of  
"Application Launch Failure. The application "(null)" could not be  
launched because of a shared library error: ")<CanonHDRcap>  
<CanonHDRcap> <RCSDKCarbon> <>". So I think there is something in  
the .app that is not cool in 10.2.8 (and maybe not 10.3.9, but that's  
gone now...)

Let me know if anyone else can get CanonHDRcap.app to work under  
anything other than 10.4! But, hey, it's working! Supercoolness...

Message-ID: <03435DB0-D427-447E-A9D2-746715200AE7@mab3d.com>

Here is one for Greg (of course):

How does CanonHDRcap determine the "minimum" exposure that is  
relevant for an HDR capture dataset?
 From my observations it seems to "search" for the darkest exposure  
where a min. % of pixels are "blown out" and then start marching up  
the exposure scale from there based on your spacing and # of shots.  
I'm sure this is an over-simplification of things, but I tried (in my  
"tethered-to-a-G5-tower-in-a-windowless-office" tests) to find that  
threshold of minimal % where the limits of my camera's shutter speed  
would be hit.

Since I'm stuck inside with my workstation, the "best and brightest"  
to focus on is a 22w halogen bulb on the ceiling track lights. It  
seemed that under certain "ideal" camera conditions (f/8, ISO 100)  
the "searching" would stop at 1/500 sec., regardless of the step  
amount for searching (and 1 stop search takes a while). If I shot  
additional images I could march down to 1/2500 sec. and still have  
nearly the same # of blown out pixels in the image (after that I  
started to resolve the bulb and reflector).

I then checked to see if the captured image resolution has anything  
to do with it (a strict # instead of %) and found no difference. When  
I tested it under tungsten bulbs, it started the series at the point  
where *no* pixels were blown out, but perhaps this is due to my  
camera settings and the dimmer bulb. Again, this is without a laptop  
to go out and sample some serious range, but I'm working on that...

BTW, I shot 13 HDRs in 2 hours, including a disappointing panorama of  
the dusty floor of my office (without being able to "lock" in the  
settings after a "search," multi-shot panos are impossible - the  
range keeps adjusting).

Hi Mark,

I thought I had explained this at some point, but I guess not....

CanonHDRcap works as you surmised, but only looks at the image  
thumbnails, not the whole image (which would take too long).  As a  
result, it doesn't always pick the right exposure to start with -- if  
your bright spot takes up less than a pixel in the thumbnail, it may  
choose a shutter speed that's slower than it should to start.

The application actually keeps the exposure right before the one that  
was blown out, so sometimes you can capture this by setting a  
*larger* search step.  This also makes the capture sequence faster.   
You may end up with a bit of a jump between the shortest exposure and  
the next-longest, but you're more likely to capture that peak.  I  
wouldn't recommend a search step greater than 4, in any case.

I could be persuaded to add a parameter for the starting shutter  
speed.  If set to some positive value, CanonHDRcap would then start  
from the specified speed rather than doing its search.

Sorry, you explained it in your introductory post on this software...  
the problem would just be me not reading everything in the archives  
when I finally get the app up and running.

Hmmm... so is there any way in the Canon SDK for CanonHDRcap to look  
at the thumnails *without* transferring the full-res files from the  
camera over the USB/Firewire cable? For the ones it "keeps" it would  
simply be writing them to the CF card for later conversion to HDR.  
This would speed things up for those of us with the low-end cameras,  
but also for the high-end cameras that can knock out 8+ frames a second!

Okay, that explains the unusual HDRs produced from my experiments  
with 5 and 6 search steps! I was curious as to the 'jump" at the  
start of the series.

That sounds great for those situations where the range is already  
"known" and repeatability is required (and I run into that all the  
time). Actually, what would be great would be for a way in the  
CanonHDRcap.out screen to have it pause at the end of a cycle and  
then accept a keystroke to either "repeat" the series of shots it  
just did with no searching (for multishot panoramas, stitched ultra- 
res images, or the off-axis shot of a mirrorball), or to "restart"  
the process (allowing time for on-camera adjustments like aperture,  
ISO, etc.).

And then it would also be great to let CanonHDRcap do its magic and  
find the best starting point and proceed up until it either hits the  
# of exposures specified, or a shutter speed specified as an "ending  
limit" (to avoid those 15 sec. exposures).

Of course, the basics are already there (and it works great so far)  
so really these are situation-specific requests. Thanks a lot for  
this, Greg. It really will be a time-saver!

Indeed, this is what I originally had in mind, but I scaled back my  
ambitions after a little quality time with the Canon SDK  
documentation.  Saving to the card and downloading images later is a  
bit of a hassle, requiring figuring out rather a lot I don't  
currently understand...  If I just left the images on the card, that  
would be one thing, but I need to download them for my application,  
and figuring out which images were saved, where, and how they were  
named, and doing all the associated file management is rather  
painful.  Not having the images written to the card in the first  
place is a whole lot simpler, so that's what I did.  I may get around  
to the more sophisticated method at some point, but don't hold your  
breath.

Pausing for input with this stupid interface means using 100% of the  
CPU in a polling loop.  (CodeWarrior and the Carbon library needed by  
the SDK are incorrigible on this point.)  You can always run  
CanonHDRcap in auto mode first, check the exposures, then set the  
camera and put it in manual mode again (by setting the f-stop search  
step to 0).  I just added this feature.

Hmmm...  I can give you the code, and you can do what you want to  
with it.  I'm not quite so fussy, it seems.

The new version with manual control over the starting point is now on  
my website.  I've also made some enhancements to raw2hdr, which works  
for non-Canon cameras as well.

Message-ID: <482F71CB-952D-4369-A4DD-97DA7FBEEEBB@biomechanicsinc.com>

Folks, some of us on the HDRI forum are getting into the specifics of  
RAW and image management (and the future RAW) - well, when Apple came  
out with Aperture, a streamlined workflow for shooting RAW, I thought  
it was pretty cool, although the idea of buying a new G5 just to run  
it was a little iffy.  There were careful efforts to differentiate it  
from Adobe Photoshop, etc. with the rampant speculation about how  
Aperture and Photoshop would get along on the playground, etc.  Apple  
even noted that Aperture was equipped to launch an external image  
editor, like Photoshop, to retain the flexibility of Aperture's  
workflow without compromising the tool set of photographers.  Then  
the initial reviews of Aperture came out and were mixed.  I  
personally have never used it.

Enter Adobe ...

http://labs.macromedia.com/technologies/lightroom/#

Hmmm - I always wondered what Adobe had in store for Macromedia....   
Methinks Adobe has responded - and released the beta to the public  
for "testing" and "feedback".  I just downloaded the available beta  
to see what's up - thought i'd share the love.  Very interesting.  As  
long as Adobe keeps forging into the RAW-o-sphere, it would seem that  
proprietary RAW formats will isolate manufacturers that choose the  
encrypted, secretive path.  But then again, what do I know?  :-)

I have also noticed more and more commercial outfits making their  
betas available to the public - yea! for open source software that  
must be, in part, responsible for showing the big guys how to rally a  
community of devotees around their app.  Oh, what will be next?  I  
just installed OpenOffice for OSX last week and thought "how cool is  
this?"  hehehehehehehe!
