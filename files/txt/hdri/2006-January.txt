Hi Kirk,

Peter is quick.  He has just set up a new mailing list, hdri@radiance- 
online.org, which I suggest you subscribe to and we will move the  
discussion there.

HDRI generation is a separate issue from tone-mapping, and although  
Photosphere attempts to do both, it only makes a weak effort in the  
tone-mapping department.  Hdrgen makes no effort to tone-map images,  
and it should not.  In fact, I don't recommend tone-mapping HDR  
images into HDR, but directly into the destination display's color  
space, as an HDR image should maintain it's scene-referred color  
space.  Some of these issues are discussed and spelled out on  
hdrsoft's excellent FAQ page:

	http://www.hdrsoft.com/resources/dri.html

Since you bring up RAW (also discussed by hdrsoft), I should mention  
that although it is tempting to shoot RAW in preparation for creating  
HDR images, I have found it not to be helpful in most cases.  The  
additional range/resolution obtained is modest, and the confusion  
resulting from the many "development" options you mention means that  
reproducibility is an issue.  Unless you have a method to go straight  
from RAW into HDRI, you are better off shooting high-quality JPEGs on  
most cameras.

I'll make an announcement under a new topic about the HDRI mailing  
list, and let's continue the discussion there.

-Greg

1) Are there software tools or algorithms available to correct these images before they are converted into an HDR image?

Martin,

Photoshop CS2 has a Lens Correction filter that will help correct  
chromatic aberration, vignetting and barrel/pincushion distortion.   
Filter>Distortion>Lens Correction

However, I opened a HDR image (*.hdr) and the Filter>Distortion menu  
option was not available, leading me to believe that it will not  
operate directly on HDR 32 bit images.  Thus, it would seem that you  
would apply it to your LDR sequence images before converting to a HDR  
image.  The filter permits the applied settings to be saved, so you  
could open one image, applying the correction and then save the  
settings for the subsequent application to the rest of the image  
sequence, permitting automation in a batch action.  If your sequence  
is taken with a tripod and the images are registered prior to  
correction, I would guess that applying the same correction through  
saved settings should displace the same pixels in each image and  
preserve image registration.

I just upgraded to CS2 so I haven't played with it yet.

I could be wrong, but don't HDR creators need the original camera shot with
exif information? Doing Photoshop adjustments would lose that info. I'm
pretty sure Photosphere needs this, but I don't know if HDRShop does.

Hi Rob - FWIW, I've never had a problem with Photoshop stripping this  
info - EXIF is kept intact.  Good point to consider though.

I suppose that if you alter the image, the EXIF info will be wiped.

My last two messages to the list only went to the posters, as I  
hadn't set it up to automatically send responses to the list.

I have now done so, more for consistency with radiance-general than  
anything else.  You now need not use the "reply all" button to get  
your post to the list.  If you wish to reply to the poster privately,  
you will have to start a separate message, as you now do on radiance- 
general.

No luck with Photoshop lens corrections. This is like poor freehand drawing. All gridlines are not vertical or horizontal, but warped in interesting ways. 
 
Each square with barrel distortion has to be corrected individually. Greg needs to do take care of this right now :) This community needs a tool to shift pixels in a Radiance image around. Input could be a black and white grid image showing the barrel distortion. Output would be the image with straight lines. 
 
Greg, I can help you with the command line :) :
 
pcomb -f barrel.cal barrelgrid.pic original.hdr > corrected.hdr
 
See, Greg, we are already halfway there :)

HDRShop will permit you to manually specify the exposure increment between each image in a LDR sequence.

		Martin,

		Photoshop CS2 has a Lens Correction filter that will help correct chromatic aberration, vignetting and barrel/pincushion distortion.  Filter>Distortion>Lens Correction

		However, I opened a HDR image (*.hdr) and the Filter>Distortion menu option was not available, leading me to believe that it will not operate directly on HDR 32 bit images.  Thus, it would seem that you would apply it to your LDR sequence images before converting to a HDR image.  The filter permits the applied settings to be saved, so you could open one image, applying the correction and then save the settings for the subsequent application to the rest of the image sequence, permitting automation in a batch action.  If your sequence is taken with a tripod and the images are registered prior to correction, I would guess that applying the same correction through saved settings should displace the same pixels in each image and preserve image registration.

		I just upgraded to CS2 so I haven't played with it yet.

Has anyone tried "LensFix & PanoTools Plug-ins for OSX" ?
I haven't had much of a chance to try it but have heard good things  
about it.
I have a product description if that is of use.

Haha.  Very funny, indeed!

I just tried the lens warp with Photoshop CS2 on my Mac, and it did  
preserve the Exif information, so I think that process could work.

Pcomb does support limited filtering, which could include some  
warping, but you have to keep the scans within 32 pixels of each  
other (or so), and that might be a problem.  You would also want to  
implement a bicubic filter, I suppose.

The GIMP image manipulation package is available for OSX, and there are a
number of interesting plug-ins, including barrel distortion. Dunno if the
EXIF info is kept, but if not, you may just save it to a text file and
re-create an appropriate EXIF header once the dirty jobs are done.

There is also Hugin, a tool for stitiching panoramas. See here:
http://hugin.sourceforge.net/tutorials/perspective/en.shtml
how you can use it to correct barrel distortion. This is kinda
extreme-unbarrelling, though...

Subject: [Hdri] HDRI capture program for Canon EOS cameras under Mac OS X
Message-ID: <9B42FD91-C850-4505-BFF6-C38FE55776E2@gmail.com>

Hi All,

Under contract with LBNL, I have written an HDR capture program that  
works with the Canon EOS 5D camera under Mac OS X, and should work  
with other Canon EOS cameras as well.  When open from the Finder, the  
application triggers a sequence of image captures, saving them to the  
laptop across a USB or Firewire connection.  Setting the camera in  
manual mode, the sequence begins at the fastest available shutter  
speed and works its way down until it finds the first exposure with  
over-exposed pixels in its thumbnail.  It saves this image along with  
the previous one, and continues downward in the exposure range  
(longer shutter times) for the number of stops and images you specify  
in a configuration file.

Unfortunately, CanonHDRcap does not work from the command line, as  
the Canon software requires building with CodeWarrior and an outdated  
Carbon application package model, which doesn't support command-line  
operation.  However, using the OS X "open" command, you can run it  
from a batch file and determine when it finishes based on another  
output file it creates, specifying the names of the image files it  
has created.  (My next task is to build a script that runs hdrgen  
automatically afterwards, which should be easy enough.)

I've put the app. on my website for any masochistic beta testers who  
want to have a go with their Canon EOS camera.  It produces beautiful  
results, so long as you don't mind lugging a laptop and a tripod with  
you; it eliminates all camera movement and does a much better job  
capturing the full range than auto-bracket mode.  The link is below:

	http://www.anyhere.com/gward/pickup/CanonHDRcap.tar.gz

Most of the camera settings are left as set on the camera, including  
aperture, white balance, JPEG/RAW mode, etc.  The one thing I'm sure  
doesn't work is storing both JPEG and RAW images at the same time,  
but let me know if you run into any other problems.

-Greg

P.S.  The correct mailing address for the list is <hdri@radiance- 
online.org>, not <hdri@www.radiance-online.org> as we originally  
announced.  (Thanks to Rob Guglielmetti for pointing this out.)

I assume that these would be the cameras the EOS Capture software is
available for. On the Canon website the list is:

EOS-1D
EOS-1Ds
EOS-1D MkII
EOS 20D
EOS-1Ds Mark II
EOS 350D
EOS 5D
EOS-1D Mark II N

(For beginners: The EOS 350D is the current low end of the list
and available for about 500 $).

URL for the (Windows) EOS Capture:

http://software.canon-europe.com/software/eos_captures22671.asp?model=

BTW: Canon has a SDK for these cameras which is probably what Greg
      has used for his HDR capture. Nice to have something for OS X,  
too.

There is a semi-working version of EOS Capture for OS X as well, but  
of course you are left to manually control the camera.  It avoids  
having to touch the camera, but it takes a while to get through the  
exposure sequence (as clouds move, etc.) and it doesn't really save  
you any effort.  CanonHDRcap gets through the exposures as quickly as  
they can be downloaded, which is pretty fast on the newer cameras  
that have Firewire or USB 2.0 support.  It might have been faster  
still if I had written the images to the card then downloaded them,  
and perhaps I will in some later version, but it's a lot more work  
for me and only really makes a difference for RAW captures on the  
5D.  (I found RAW captures not to be the way to go for HDR merging,  
for various reasons.)

Rob G. asked about Nikon cameras, and we did look at them originally,  
but there were two things that led us to use the Canon 5D.  One was  
the fact that we needed to capture full 180-degree circular fisheye  
images, and this requires a full-frame sensor.  The second was the  
way Nikon created a separate SDK with a different programming  
interface for every model camera, which makes supporting more than  
one a real pain.  It's a shame, though, because we have this really  
awesome f/2.8 Nikkor fisheye lens, and the adaptor ring that's  
supposed to mount Nikon lenses on Canon bodies doesn't work for this  
particular lens.

Could you elaborate on those, Greg?  I've been capturing TIFs for HDR assembly but was thinking of using RAW for a wider dynamic range.

Wow...I wish I could automate capture for my Nikon.    I've been using the FC-E9 spherical fisheye with my 5700 and getting some nice results with a custom made pano bracket designed just for the lens.   I would love to be able to automate the capture and/or processing of the images...Nikon capture doesn't and won't ever (according to the reps I've talked to) include fisheye unwarping for this lens.  Which is a shame really...it's a brilliant piece of glass.

Hi Lisa,

Nikon really does make the greatest lenses.  LBNL has this f/2.8  
Nikkor fisheye that's just amazing, but unfortunately doesn't work  
with any of the Nikon digital cameras in the sense that the 1.5  
multiplier turns the 180 degree circle into a partial view.  It's  
vignetting is quite low for a fisheye -- just -20% at the edge at f/ 
4.0.  The 8mm Sigma lens we got for the Canon is pathetic by  
comparison, with vignetting of -80% from at the edge at f/5.6, and  
the eccentricity is not very linear, either.  (See attached graphs  
for comparison.)  Unfortunately, the Nikkor->Canon adaptor ring we  
bought doesn't seem to work for a Nikkor manual lens.

Regarding RAW captures, I've run into problems with pink highlights  
showing up under some lighting conditions, and I can't seem to shake  
them.  There are also issues with noise at the bottom end, and we  
avoid this as well if we just use JPEG or 24-bit TIFF output.  The  
reason is that cameras have a lot of built-in processing that cleans  
up the sensor range and shortcomings you just don't want to deal with  
yourself.  As long as the camera doesn't mess up the tone curve, the  
on board processing generally helps the HDR merge process more than  
it hurts it.  (Automatic white balance is one of the notable  
exceptions, but luckily we can disable that.)

The potential benefit you cite for RAW images, the bit depth, turns  
out to be an illusion.  Although many RAW files contain 12 bits/ 
channel, it's in a linear space rather than the gamma response space  
of JPEG or 24-bit TIFF, and doesn't actually encompass a greater  
dynamic range.  (See my page at <http://www.anyhere.com/gward/hdrenc/ 
 >  and scroll down to "What Is a Gamma Encoding?" to more.)  Since  
the camera and the A/D converter inside the camera are both linear  
devices, this is in fact why 12 bits is necessary for an 8-bit gamma- 
encoded output.  Otherwise, you'd end up with horribly visible  
quantization errors (banding) at the bottom end.

So what happens to the extra 4 bits of resolution?  The answer is, it  
gets *wasted* at the top end, giving us much finer steps than we're  
able to see or represent in an 8-bit, gamma=2.2 encoding.  Could this  
ever be useful in an HDR merging process?  Maybe, if your output  
format could capture these finer steps, and you spaced your exposures  
close enough that you could get the top ends of all your exposures to  
cover the full range of the scene, but by that time, exposure  
averaging will give you the same benefit from standard 8-bit/channel  
JPEGs.  In other words, a RAW process to HDR is a lot of work for  
very little benefit.  You don't get additional range at the top or  
bottom; white balance ends up as more of a problem rather than less  
of one, and the loss of noise-reduction processing in the camera  
makes the deep shadows look much worse.

I spent the better part of a week playing with dcraw.c and the Canon  
EOS 5D to find all this out.  It's possible that my conclusions don't  
apply to all cameras that produce RAW output, but in some ways,  
that's another argumentagainst it -- camera RAW files are all  
different!  If you're trying to build up or recommend a standard  
practice, I think RAW is a great big unknown in the equation, and  
much harder to work out than the camera response function, which is  
as far as I can tell, the *only* effort RAW saves you.

That's my 2 cents.
-Greg

Hi all,

For those interested. I just wanted to report my success so far. I have 
accomplished the following:

   1. acquire mac-mini
   2. open and install 1G RAM upgrade
   3. install photosphere
   4. run remote session to mac-mini via VNC allowing for use of full OS
      X desktop and applications (including photosphere)

So this is a great little HDR image processing appliance that can be run 
remotely to other types of systems using VNC. Pretty neat.

I have been doing some initial experimenting with a Cannon EOS 5D and a 
Sigma 8mm Fisheye. The camera is pretty cool, certainly the most 
high-end digital I have used. It is very nice the way the the camera can 
be controlled from a pc (windows, sorry). Not sure what to report on the 
lens yet. I guess there is the optical vignetting issue that Greg 
provided some data on, however I guess practicality of equipment ease of 
use also has to play an important part.

Preliminary experience with Photosphere is quite nice. Now on to trying 
out some IBL.

CanonHDRcap seems to work fine with the EOS 20D (a quick test).

I get this for the Digitial rebel:

Is this a permissions issue?  I got the same error with the default "/

So I got it to run and shoot a sequence of images, but it only keeps  
2 of the JPEGs ( i shot in JPEG mode).

Here is the log file text:

-----
/Applications/CanonHDRCap/fun444793328.jpg
/Applications/CanonHDRCap/fun444793086.jpg
/Applications/CanonHDRCap/fun444793328.jpg
/Applications/CanonHDRCap/fun444793086.jpg
/Applications/CanonHDRCap/fun444793328.jpg
/Applications/CanonHDRCap/fun444793086.jpg
.
-----

It seems as if it keeps writing those two files over each other - is  
this correct?  These are the two files in the folder.  I am shooting  
inside at night, so there may not be a huge range of exposures.   
Could this be the issue?  I break things really well, so I like being  
a beta tester!


Also, it took a while for me to repeatedly launch the app and finally  
establish a connection.  I have the communications settings on my  
Digital Rebel set to normal, not PTP.  My camera is sort of an older  
Digital Rebel - i wonder if this makes any difference.

Here are my Capture Parameters:

1										; verbose output? (0 or 1)
"/Applications/CanonHDRCap/fun"			; base output name
"/Applications/CanonHDRCap/capfiles.txt"	; capture file names log
2										; search f-stop step
1										; f-stops beteween captures
6										; # images to acquire

i'll try a smaller search f-stop.

Sounds like you figured this one out, but CanonHDRcap doesn't  
interpret the '~' character as the user's home directory, the way the  
C-shell does.  The fix there is to use the full path in your  
CaptureParams.txt file.

It seems like the Digital Rebel is not correctly setting the  
SequenceID parameter in the SDK for some reason.  It doesn't appear  
to be anything you're doing wrong.  I'll have to come up with a  
workaround for this as there's no way to fix either the camera or the  
SDK -- I'll give it some more thought tomorrow morning.

Same thing on my computer at work - I used the absolute path, I have  
the latest firmware ... going to go out on a limb and guess that the  
(or my) Digital Rebel (300D) is not compatible?

The app logs that it writes 6 files - the number I have specified in  
the Param file.  however, it actually writes the same two files three  
times alternating between the two, effectively causing capture 3 to  
overwrite 1, capture 4 to overwrite 2, capture 5 to overwrite 3 and  
capture 6 to overwrite 4, leaving two files (captures 5 and 6) in the  
capture folder.  it always writes the same two files as shown below  
(fun444793328.jpg and fun444793086.jpg).  i suppose these file names  
mean something specific to the image, capture settings or something?   
I wonder why they would alternate repeating, resulting in successive  
overwrites.  The images that are written are actual JPEG images, so a  
valid file is written, presumably each time.

Oh well, I'll keep at it.

Also, it sometimes takes a few attempts for communication to be  
established with the camera (I exit and relaunch the app and it  
eventually works.

Sorry for the blabber, the camera is firmware 1.1.1, current for the  
300D according to Canon's website.

Hi Kirk (and other EOS 300D users),

I've uploaded a new version of CanonHDRcap for Mac OS X to my  
website, same URL:

	http://www.anyhere.com/gward/pickup/CanonHDRcap.tar.gz

I've put in a workaround that should hopefully fix the problem with  
the Canon EOS 300D (Digital Rebel).  The image file name is made from  
the sequenceID returned by the camera, which seems to be garbage in  
the case of the 300D.  I simply reset to 1 any values over 9999, and  
start doing my own count.

To make this work, I've added a new line to the CaptureParams.txt to  
control whether or not the program will overwrite existing image  
files.  This must be set to 0 for proper operation with the 300D, and  
you'll probably want to set it to 0 for most other situations as well.

-Greg

Greg -

As always, I am grateful for your consideration of my "issues".  I  
really appreciate it.  Hopefully you find my ability to break things  
helpful and not a waste of time.

Again,

Thanks for the extra effort - you rock.

Kirk

Works like a charm.

Hi Kirk,

Glad this works.  I really appreciate all the detailed reports of  
your problems with the Digital Rebel -- it made it obvious what was  
going wrong, and it helps a lot to have complete information, since I  
don't have your camera to play with.  I think it's important to  
support what I can, and the 300D is probably the most popular in  
Canon's EOS line, so I wouldn't want to leave those people out if I  
can help it.  I'm just glad it wasn't something more serious in the  
SDK, since there's no real support for it outside Japan.  I may have  
to ask Santiago to help me if I ever need to communicate with  
headquarters....

I have put together some scripts, including the RAW -> HDR converter  
I've been playing with in a more complete package on my website.   
It's linked into my front page <www.anyhere.com> where the old hdrgen  
link for Mac OS X used to be.  (You may have to hit your browser's  
"Reload" button to see it.)  I just finished a "canoncap" script that  
runs CanonHDRcap and hdrgen for you.

Check it out:

	http://www.anyhere.com/html/gward/pickup/HDRcapOSX.tar.gz

I figured it was easier just to put it all together for OS X users,  
rather than maintaining a whole bunch of separate links.  A  
README.txt file hopefully explains enough to get you started.

Of course, the next question is:

	"What do we have to do to convince you to make a plugin architecture  
for it?"

All of us poor saps with Nikon SLRs want to play too.  I know you  
certainly don't want to, but I'd be willing to kick in the time to  
get it working with my D70.  Are the program and Canon API horribly  
intertwined, or is it something you can make available to  
enterprising third parties that want support for their cameras?  Just  
a thought, it looks great as it is.

Cheers

Hi Trent,

I believe one of the problems with the Nikons is that each camera uses a 
differint API. I quote below from an earlier post from Greg on the topic:

Yeh, that's why I was asking about a plugin API to add additional  
cameras.  If I'm willing to do the work to get my D70 to work,  
someone else might be willing to to do a D200.  Sure, you'd end up  
having to tack on 2 dozen shared libraries to support every camera,  
but I'd still say that for me to add support for my camera is less  
effort than to reinvent everything else Greg has done.

It's a shame about Nikon being so difficult.   I'd love to have 
support for my 5700 and FC-E9 spherical fisheye.  It would make 
capturing 360 degree spherical HDRs so much easier.

Greg,

Thanks for the information on RAW capture....definitely worth more 
than 2 cents!  I've never been good at the math part of digital 
photography...my knowledge is purely experiential.  Many years of 
Zone system shooting, printing, and plotting film curves.

I also expect this is why CS2 is inferior in assembling HDRs to 
Photosphere.   I recently ran a test with the same set of 5 
panos...and the CS2 image was noticeably contrastier, with banding in 
the extreme ends of the exposure.   Also the .hdr file size was 4 MB 
smaller than the one generated in your app.

It's taken me many months of trial and error...but I've finally got 
an all OSX work flow that's reliable and repeatable.

I capture 5 or more exposures at each of 6 positions around, using a 
Nikon 5700 with FC-E9 full spherical fisheye.  I crop and de-warp 
images in Photoshop (using a custom plug-in), then stitch in 
Stitcher 4 (now 5), then put back the missing EXIF data and do the 
finally assembly in Photosphere.

Anyone else have experience using a non-SLR digital camera for HDR capture?

Lisa

With which custom plugin do you do the crop and de-warp? 
 
Thanks

Hi Trent,

The other thing I didn't mention about Nikon is that they deliver  
their software APIs on about 15 CDs, after having you sign a long non- 
disclosure agreement and mailing it in, making it a bit of a pain to  
get started.

I wouldn't bother to make a plug-in architecture for what I have, but  
I'm happy to supply source code to anyone who is interested in  
developing an interface for their camera.  There isn't much to the  
program, really.  The only thing that it does that's worth anything  
is the code to extract pixels from the thumbnails.

John Mardaljevic pointed out that I misquoted the URL for the capture  
software, which is actually at:

	http://www.anyhere.com/gward/pickup/HDRcapOSX.tar.gz

Also, I forgot to include the README.txt file, which I've appended to  
this e-mail for those who found the link and download what was there  
already.  (I added it to the archive just now, so new downloads  
should get it.)  As the README explains, only the CanonHDRcap  
application and the canoncap script are Canon-specific.  Of these,  
the canoncap script is easy enough to modify, but you need a  
scriptable program to operate your camera remotely for it to do  
anything useful.

	HDR Capture Utilities 0.9

	01/24/2006	Greg Ward with help & sponsorship (see Acknowledgements)

I have put together a few utilities that should make HDR capture a little
easier, especially for Canon EOS cameras.  There are three directories in
this distribution:

app/	Canon HDR capture application and control file
bin/	C-shell scripts and PPC executables
doc/	Some HTML documentation

Instructions for all users
==========================
Put the files in the bin/ directory either in /usr/local/bin or your own
bin directory -- someplace in your execution path.  The hdrgen program should
be familiar to you already, but for information, consult the included
hdrgen.html document.  Below is a brief description of the other programs:

canoncap	- C-shell script to manage Canon HDR capture & conversion
dcraw		- David Coffin's RAW image converter, needed by raw2hdr
raw2hdr		- C-shell script for RAW -> HDR merging

The canoncap script is not really relevant, unless you are one of the...

Canon EOS users
===============
Move the contents of the app/ directory someplace sensible, such as
/Applications/Utilities or somewhere under your home directory.  You
will need to edit the CaptureParams.txt file, which needs to live in the
same folder as the CanonHDRcap application.

Edit the CaptureParams.txt file with a text editor.  If you want to save all
the images you capture, make sure the second line is set to 0.  If you would
rather not have these files left around (and you don't own an EOS 300D camera),
set this to 1 to clean up LDR files afterwards.  Then, choose an output
directory and base file name for your images, which will have a 4-digit
number and extension added to them.  If you like, change the search f-stop
step, which indicates the spacing between exposure times as CanonHDRcap
looks for the first useful exposure.  The next line (f-stops between captures)
indicates the spacing for the actual sequence, with the final setting being
the number of captures to take.

You will need to set the camera in "manual" exposure mode, and you
should fix the white balance to match your scene and choose an
aperture that allows a slightly underexposed image at the fastest
shutter speed, or wide open for darker scenes.  You can capture either
JPEG images (preferred) or RAW, but not both.  Also, you may get
better results if you turn off autofocus.  Obviously, you'll want
to mount the camera on a tripod -- if you just set it on a table,
an SLR will tend to shift from its mirror action.  Connect the
camera to the Mac via its USB or Firewire connector, and off you
go.  Be sure to set it in the "PC connect" mode, not PTP, which is
for printers and doesn't function for remote control applications.
Double-click on CanonHDRcap from the Finder, or use the canoncap
script described below.

The "canoncap" script runs CanonHDRcap and hdrgen/raw2hdr for you from the
command line, but you need to edit the script first to set the appropriate
installation paths according to where you've put things.  Open canoncap
with a text editor, and alter the "set respf=" and "set capapp=" lines
appropriately.  The first sets the location of your camera's response file,
which will be created the first time you run the script.  From the command
line in a Terminal or xterm window, run:

	canoncap {output.hdr}

to capture your image.  Just like raw2hdr and hdrgen, you can actually output
to any number of HDR formats, as determined by the suffix on your output file:

	.exr	- OpenEXR format (large, highly accurate)
	.tif	- LogLuv TIFF (more compact, accurate)
	.hdr	- Radiance RGBE format (compact, reasonably accurate)
	.jpg	- BrightSide's JPEG-HDR format (very compact, less accurate)

I have found RAW captures to be problematic for HDR capture, resulting in pink
areas that seem to be caused by the default highlight normalization in dcraw.
I'm not sure how to fix this problem, but any hints would be appreciated.

That's it.  Let me know if you run into problems.

Hi Lisa,

What I've noticed in Photoshop CS2's "Merge to HDR" function is that  
they try to preserve some of the "character" of the original image.   
To do this, they would have to maintain the camera's tone curve,  
which is impossible if your goal is to obtain a scene-referred HDR  
result. In other words, they set conflicting goals for their process,  
and the result is something that satisfies neither goal very well.

I do HDR captures with my Olympus 4040 all the time, but I don't  
attempt to do stitching.  The biggest problem with non-SLR cameras is  
that they tend to suffer much more from lens flare, since their  
optics are not up to 35 mm standards.

Martin,

Unfortunately, the plug-in I have is a commercially unavailable beta. It was written to test the viability of using the Nikon FC-E8 and FC-E9  spherical lenses for spherical HDR capture.   I obtained it as part of the research I was doing as the Team Leader of the Pixel Corp's 2003 HDR Team.

I do my cropping and dewarping in Photoshop (still using V7)...I keep everything in registration by stacking my exposures for each position on top of each other, each on it's own layer.   Then I crop to a square that just hugs the spherical image, de-warp each layer, and save out to a TIF.   This gives me the perfectly registered and identically cropped images necessary to use Stitcher.

Lisa

I don`t know wether this is the same, but I`ve used a Nikon 5000 and  
what I did was to convert everything to rad format first using  
HDRgen, and then crop with pcompos (this could also do the stitch) I  
was not de-warping though, but doing like this I could do everything  
in a script .
Maybe pcomb could do the de-warping in several steps to limit the -y  
displacements...? don`t know if it`s possible at all
my cent and a half :) hope it makes sense

Unfortunately, Photoshop is not trying to preserve anything from the
original image. It's trying to get everything linear and do the merge.
BUT there are some problems with the current code.

And, of course, Photoshop is color managed - so if your display profile is
out of whack, images will look bad in Photoshop.

Greg - very nice little set of scripts and apps.

http://kirkt.smugmug.com/gallery/1156911

is a smugmug gallery of a test sequence and tone-mapped LDR of a shot  
out the window of my office.  I also took the tone-mapped TIFF and  
made some moves in the L, a and b channels for tweaking.  No masking  
was done, so all of the pixels got moved - I think the tone-mapped  
LDR could probably benefit from some masking during color  
manipulation, as those hot areas like outside the window get that  
funky ethereal glow about them.  This kind of thing is more for  
aesthetics than quantitative lighting analysis, so I plan to take  
some liberties.

Note - for the JPEG sequence on the smugmug site, down below the  
large image is a link to view the EXIF data if you are curious.

Super cool.  The whole process took about 30 seconds for the sequence  
capture and output to HDR.

I just noticed that if you open a .HDR file in PSCS2 and then change  
the mode from 32 bit to 16 bit, it gives you some different tone- 
mapping options as well.  Interesting - anyone ever use these?

However, I'm not a big fan of "no value" posts, so if anyone is 
interested in panoramic HDR photography methods (and after reading the

outlining my personal "off the shelf" capture methods:
