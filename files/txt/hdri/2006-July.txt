Hi All,

I will be attending SIGGRAPH again this year, and I am naturally  
looking forward to the "High-Dynamic-Range Imaging: Theory and  
Applications" course w/ Greg et al, and I will be heading over to the  
Image Manipulation Papers on Monday. I'm generally wondering who else  
on this list (aside from the obvious) will be in Boston? And related  
to that, is the HDRI BOF worth a slot on the schedule?

I'll also be wandering the Conference w/ iBook, Canon and HDRcapOSX  
shooting HDRs in both framed and panoramic formats, and I hope to  
share them with the list shortly after I get back. (One of my goals  
is to capture a Brightside monitor in HDR for those who cannot attend!)

-Mark

Mark,

I haven't posted much, but I will be at SIGGRAPH, and I have a 
piece of art in the gallery and a talk on Sunday morning about 
it. The image was rendered with Radiance, but had to be printed, 
so I guess it's not HDR anymore. It's at

Hi Mark,

I am attending the conference (or at least the papers/panels). Perhaps
if there are enough people HDRI/Radiance we could figure out some way to
all meet somewhere? Any others attending?

PS: cross posted for other that might be interested...

Hi Jack & Mark (& anyone else who will be there),

This is why I was asking about the HDRI "birds of a feather" meeting  
on Tuesday (details below)

High-Dynamic-Range Imagery BOF
Boston Convention and Exhibition Center - Room 251
5 - 6 pm, Tuesday, 1 August

I'm also guessing that more than a few of us will be at the full-day  
HDRI seminar on Sunday, so there is a possibility of meeting up after  
that. It might be possible to find a very dark bar/ resto with very  
bright scenery out the windows...  ;-) With only a few people it  
could all be very spur-of-the-moment.

-Mark

Subject: [HDRI] HDR Codec
Message-ID: <mailman.0.1153851706.346.hdri@radiance-online.org>

BrightSide has been developing a new video compression technique for high
dynamic range images.  At the upcoming SIGGRAPH conference, BrightSide will
be demonstrating the results of this work by showcasing an MPEG-HDR codec in
concert with a High Dynamic Range display.  The primary user benefits of the
MPEGHDR codec are:

 

*         HDR content is preserved throughout the entire digital imaging
pipeline

 

*         Original HDR content can be archived at reduced storage cost

 

*         Image quality is maintained through various stages of video
editing

 

Looking beyond SIGGRAPH BrightSide is interested in developing partnerships
to further develop and license our compression technology.  If you are
planning to attend the SIGGRAPH conference this year and would be interested
in seeing a demonstration of the power and utility of HDR compression please
let contact Mark Grist mark.grist@brightsidetech.com  to arrange a meeting.
Follow this link for more information on the MPEG-HDR codec.
