Here's another panorama - LDR but with a twist.  This panorama is  
composed of 10 macro photos of a charm bracelet.  The image was  
composed by stitching the top row (5 images left to right) and bottom  
row (5 images left to right).  These two panoramas were then stitched  
together with a single wave of the magic "pano orig" and "pano dest"  
wand.

The bracelet was moved underneath the stationary camera - an XY  
positioning table would have been nice, but a white note pad did the  
trick.  There is motion artifact in the upper right of the image,  
where the bracelet must have moved between shots.  Pretty cool.  I  
resized the image down to 5000 pixels wide.  I can imagine very large  
microscopy panoramas being generated this way, with a flash or HTML  
component that would permit the viewer to click on a section of a lo- 
res image and get a higher res version of that section - sort of like  
zooming in.  The lighting was provided during midday, under a patio  
umbrella.  To get sufficient DoF, I used f/32 with 1/2 sec shutter  
speed across all images.  The first time I tried to generate the  
image sequence, the sun went in, and the exposure got messed up.  The  
next time, the clouds cooperated.

Message-ID: <F03C8E73-B34B-4755-BA48-EB74EF09E567@mab3d.com>

I've seen this a lot before: resizing a 32-bit file in Photoshop CS2  
with their bicubic interpolator produces artifacts that look like  
"excessive sharpening halos" around high contrast details. Because of  
this, I simply stopped scaling images in Photoshop and instead use  
Photosphere (no problems).

However, I was recently perusing the Adobe user-to-user forums, and  
it was determined that the "sharpening artifacts" are only present if  
you subsequently save the file in Radiance format. It was then  
proposed by an Adobe employee that "the radiance file format code may  
have some problems dealing with extreme values." (keep in mind these  
are user-to-user forums, not developer comments).

Here is the thread in question:
http://www.adobeforums.com/cgi-bin/webx/.3bbe9c64

Now I know that Photoshop's Bicubic does some sharpening (even  
without using "Bicubic Sharper"), and that sharpening of any kind on  
an HDR file results in extreme values, but does the Radiance file  
format itself have a problem with extreme values? Or is this a combo  
of PS Bicubic and their Radiance I/O? I pretty much store all of my  
"in progress" files in Radiance format and then create "final HDR  
files" from them in EXR, so this has effected me and my workflow.

-Mark

BTW, I've also found a huge flaw in Photoshop CS2's "Merge to HDR"  
when small, bright details are moving between shots (think ghosted  
leaves in a mild breeze) - so I don't even use PS CS2 for *creating*  
HDRs anymore, but the PS CS2 "clone tool" and the plugin Flexify 2  
are pretty much indispensable for retouching HDRs, so I'm using  
Photoshop in any case.

Hi Mark,

The Radiance RGBE format is not able to record negative pixel values,  
so such primary values should be clamped to zero.  Apparently,  
Photoshop is not doing this.  Photosphere (and the Radiance tools)  
check for and truncate negative primaries, writing them out as 0's.   
OpenEXR doesn't have this issue, as it can read and write negative  
primary values -- in fact, you are better off using OpenEXR for your  
intermediates also as it is a higher-precision format.  It doesn't  
really make sense to use a lower-precision format like RGBE for  
intermediate results then write out your final as OpenEXR, as you've  
lost information along the way.  It would make more sense the other  
way around.

This is because of the sharpening aspect of bicubic kernels (they really
don't work for HDR images), and can be made worse in the Radiance file
format because we weren't clamping negative values correctly.

Hi Greg,

Aarrgh... right you are. A very long time ago I set up a workflow  
that was all Radiance file based because: 1) my 3D software only  
understood that file type, and 2) I read "somewhere" that Radiance  
format could store a much greater range than OpenEXR. Despite reading  
many other details about both formats, I stuck with my initial,  
oversimplified understanding which was "Radiance holds more  
brightness than EXR."

Basically, I should've read your HDR Image Encodings page even more  
carefully - not only is the precision in OpenEXR much higher, but  
most of the extra brightness latitude in RGBE is essentially unused,  
even for my very-wide-range "light probe" panoramas. EXR is very  
widely accepted now, and I think 10.7 orders of magnitude is enough  
for my purposes... ;-)

Good thing I posted what I did... I doubt I'll forget it now.

-Mark

Hi Chris,

Glad you are on this list as well!

Hot on the heels of my previous post about the Radiance files from  
Photoshop CS2, I've put up a page to explain the amplified artifacts  
I have seen in "Merge to HDR" in CS2 (and why I stopped using it).  
Perhaps you can take a look at this and tell me where I've either  
gone wrong or perhaps why I'm seeing these dramatic effects. The odd  
part is that I don't remember having this problem in the past, but I  
know that I recently upgraded to 9.0.1 and because of this problem I  
have switched to batch HDR-creation with Photomatix instead (despite  
using CS2 in my workflow right *after* creating the HDRs).

Here is a page (with links to the "originals") illustrating the  
problem I am seeing with "ghosts" in PS CS2 Merge to HDR:

http://www.mab3d.com/temp/ot3d/HDartifacts.html

At the same time, this is a general query to see if anyone else has  
seen/ had these problems with Merge to HDR in CS2, and what they have  
discovered.

-Mark

BTW, for those that are interested, the ZIP archive of stitched  
exposures includes JPEGs that have the metadata from the pre-stitch  
images appended to them by EXIFtool - makes HDR creation a bit  
easier. Plus, if you peruse this data in a capable image browser you  
can get a good idea of how I process my RAWs for HDR creation.
