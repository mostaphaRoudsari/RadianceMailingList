Subject: [HDRI] Support for JPEG HDR?
Message-ID: <A47DEEC5-BC5F-42F8-9C42-F5C500AF26E1@mab3d.com>

Hey quiet list!

I have a couple of questions for Greg and anyone else who is on top  
of this:

- What viewing software (aside from Photosphere) supports the full  
decoding of the JPEG HDR file format?
- What utilities are available for the non-commercial conversion of  
HDR files to JPEG HDR (on a server)? (Should I be talking to  
Brightside?)
- Are there any common graphics toolkits (like ImageMagick, NetPBM,  
etc.) that can non-destructively transform HDR images?

If you can't tell where I'm going with this, then let me explain: I'd  
basically like to set up a web-based "gallery" of LDR and HDR images  
with dynamic content processed by the server. Files in common HDR  
formats could be uploaded and the server would handle things like  
thumbnails, resizing, gathering image data, and converting to browser- 
viewable JPEG HDR. (The HDR version would then be "inspectable" upon  
downloading the JPEG HDR) I've got all the pieces except HDR support...

Hi Mark,

This would seem to fit within the "non-commercial" restrictions of  
the JPEG-HDR software license from BrightSide Technologies.  You can  
download compiled tools for Linux, Windows, and OS X to go between  
JPEG-HDR and Radiance RGBE formats from their website:

	http://www.brightsidetech.com/products/process.php

I have a program for OS X that reads and writes all the formats  
understood by Photosphere, and allows simple resampling and  
brightness scaling.  It would be possible to compile it under Linux  
with a little work, but Windows of course is a pain in the arse...

Hi Mark,

You can also take a look at:

http://www.mpi-sb.mpg.de/resources/pfstools/

The latest version (1.3 in the CVS) can read and write JPEG HDR files
("jpeghdr" library must be installed before compilation). There are
command line tools for resizing, cropping and reading/writing files in
all major HDR formats. The software is GPLed.

Hi Greg & Rafal,

Thank you both for pointing out those resources! I will definitely be  
playing around with them to see what I can come up with. It looks  
like pfstools will do most of what I need (as long as I can handle a  
makefile or two -  hey, I'm just an artist), and I think I'll contact  
Brightside just to make sure I'm on the non-commercial side of the  
fence regarding JPEG HDR.

So outside of Photosphere and pfsview, are there any other JPEG HDR  
viewers available yet? (Not that I mind recommending that visitors  
get Photosphere, but building pfsview.exe might be a bit much for  
some Windows users...)

Thanks again!

-Mark

I can't answer this question regarding JPEG HDR, but if you need a
starting point for your search, you might want to try this page of HDR
software:
http://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/webhdr/software.shtml

Although none of the packages is listed as supporting JPEG HDR, you might
be lucky, and one or the other supports them. Please feel free to email me
any comments or updates about the page.

Not that i can bring light into the viewer topic...
The only software i have found so far supporting (dynamic) viewing of 
HDR JPEG images, is Helmut Dersch's PTViewer - and it can only handle 
images that are created by PTConvert.

When reading about the JPEG-HDR binaries from the 
Brightsidetech-Homepage, i remembered Erik Reinhard's TMO binaries 
collection - and i would be curious if someone could give a clue how to 
contact Erik to ask him if there is chance to make this collection 
public available (I've already sent a PM to ...@cs.bris.ac.uk but this 
address seems to be a black hole).
Any tips would be greatly appreciated!

Best regards
Bernhard

Hi Bernhard,

I'm sure Erik will make the code available at some point, but right  
now he and I are hoping that people will by the HDRI book to get it  
on the DVD-ROM.  It's one of those evil marketing ploys....

Hello,

For all those who will be at CeBIT fair in Hannover (9-15 March 2006)
there is an opportunity to see the demos of our research on High
Dynamic Range Imaging: HDR Acquisition, Tone Mapping, HDR Compression
(http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/resources/hdr/). Some results we will be shown
on a 37" HDR display from BrightSide. Our booth:

MPI Informatik
Halle 9
Stand B43

There is an opportunity to talk with us personally. We will be at the
booth on the following days:

Grzegorz Krawczyk: March 9th/10th/15th
Rafal Mantiuk: March 11th
Karol Myszkowski: March 13th (afternoon), 14th

See you in Hannover,

Hi guys,

I've reworked the page on camera compatibility with WebHDR. It is now
updated on-the-fly on new submissions and runs of WebHDR. You might want
to use it for reference when shopping around for a suitable camera for
taking HDR pickies:
http://luminance.londonmet.ac.uk/webhdr/cameras.shtml

Please note that an 'O.K' doesn't necessarily mean the cam will work with
hdrgen/Photoshpere, too. What it does mean, however, is that the pictures
can be batch-processed with free, OpenSource software and without
additional user input to make them work (Perl + ExifTools).

If there is any interest, I'd be happy to write a little utility and post
it to the list.

Furthermore, I am wondering if any of you have access to older Nikon
CoolPix models (8xx and 9xx). If so, could I kindly as you to submit a
picture to the address above. Thanks 1000 for your time!

Cheers

Axel

PS: Pics of cameras not listed yet are also welcome.

Message-ID: <24E206FB-CE87-4BEE-A796-47DD0432FE67@gmail.com>

Hi All,

For those of you lucky enough to be bleeding on the edge of the new  
MacIntel machines, I finally have a working Universal version of  
Photosphere, available from the front page of <www.anyhere.com>.  As  
expected, there were a few bugs to fix in the byte-swapping code, so  
sharing catalogs between architectures should work, now.  (I also  
updated the PowerPC-only version, and the two applications have  
different names to avoid confusion.)  All image formats are now fully  
supported.

The only things that aren't quite there are the Application icon,  
which I can't figure out how to reinstate, and the file types, which  
the Universal app doesn't seem to understand when you drag images  
onto its (generic) icon.  I'm not sure when (or if) I'll get those  
things fixed, as I can't recall how I got them working in the first  
place....

-Greg

P.S.  Thanks is due to Bruce Carlin for the loan of his MacBook Pro,  
which enabled me to compile the OpenEXR and TIFF libraries and debug  
the Intel operation.

Aahhh! Universal it is! So under LINUX it finally runs. Or does it?

Sorry, "Universal" is probably a misnomer, but it isn't my  
misnomer...  It would be great if I had a Linux version, and maybe at  
some point I will.  I just need someone to do the port to a system- 
independent GUI library (like WxWidgets or Qt), then we'll have a  
common base that works for Windows, Linux, and OS X.  Wouldn't be a  
bad idea for Radiance's rvu program, either...

Apologies for the cross-posting, but there isn't 100% overlap on

BrightSide Technologies is having an HDR animation contest for all  
those who are interested in participating:

The field is wide open as near as I can tell.
