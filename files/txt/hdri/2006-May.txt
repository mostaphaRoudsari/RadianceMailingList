Subject: [HDRI] New site offering HDRI spherical panoramas
Message-ID: <2AE640CE-868C-4488-AEC3-2DC5520C965B@lmi.net>

A friend of ours on the mailing list, Lisa Yimm, informed me of a  
website she started for rendering folks in search of high-quality HDR  
panoramas to use for image-based lighting:

	http://hdrvfx.com

There seem to be some really nice scenes in there.

Meanwhile, I'm busy at work on a new panorama stitching feature for  
standard and HDR images in Photosphere.  Look for that in the next  
week or two.  Unfortunately, it won't be able to create full  
spherical panos like the one on Lisa's site, due to the warping and  
stretching that would require.

Subject: [HDRI] Photosphere 1.6 available
Message-ID: <A8337AC1-389F-4DD0-842B-97DA8C00CE74@gmail.com>

Hi All,

I just uploaded version 1.6 of Photosphere, both PPC and Universal  
versions to my website:

	http://www.anyhere.com

The made addition since version 1.5 is the ability to create  
panoramas from overlapping images.  It's not as easy to use as  
Photoshop perhaps, but the results are often nicer and best of all,  
it works with HDR source images.  The user interface to it is a  
little shaky, but it actually is fairly reliable once you get used to  
the concept.  Here is the item I appended to quickstart_pf.txt  
describing the process:

15) To stitch together a panorama, choose a set of images and open
them.  In each image, select a salient feature that is also visible
in the adjacent image.  Click the "Apply" button in the image viewer
and choose "Pano Orig" in the first image, then move to the second
image, select the matching feature, and choose "Pano Dest".  After a
moment, the selection box in the second image should disappear,
indicating these two images have been linked.  If the "Apply" button
is missing "Pano Orig" or "Pano Dest" in its pop-up menu, that means
the box is either too big or in the wrong image.  If you have
previously selected a set of anchors or created a panorama and wish
to start a new one, use the "Clear Pano" command that shows up in
the "Apply" pop-up when nothing is selected.  After each link has
been made, you may select the next feature for linking to another
neighbor, or choose "Make Panorama..." from the "File" menu if you
are done or wish to see what you have linked so far.  By scaling
down the output resolution, you can obtain a quick preview to check
your work.  You can always add new linked images or change existing
links via the "Apply" pop-up menu, or start over by selecting "Clear
Pano" or pressing the "Clear" button in the "Make Panorama" dialog.
It may take a few tries before you get used to the idea of selecting
image features, and some features definitely work better than others.
It's best to select a corner or prominence with high contrast.  Busy
areas make for poor feature matching, which can cause misalignment
in the results.  Trees and mountain peaks are good features.  Fields
of grass and waves on water are not.

Note that I did not design it to handle complex panorama  
assemblages.  It really only works for simple horizontal and vertical  
arrangements, with one feature joining each image in a chain.  You'll  
also find that it does not work well with fisheye or highly distorted  
images, as there is no unwarping operation applied.  Nevertheless, I  
hope it finds some use.

Greg - that is pretty cool.  It is fairly easy to get the idea of  
linking one to the next image.  Thanks!  Now I have to go out and  
take a bunch of panoramic, multiple-exposure images and see what  
happens!  What do you think is the lower threshold from a lens focal  
length perspective (haha!) that will still give a relatively  
distortion-free stitched image?  i assume we can exposure balance the  
HDRs in Photosphere prior to stitching to get even exposure across  
the panorama.  Is there a way to get the panoramic exposure balance  
automagically?  I guess I'll experiment with it before I ask any more  
stupid questions.

later,

kirk

Hi Kirk,

Thanks for the feedback.  I'm happy, and somewhat amazed, that you've  
figured out how to use it already.  The interface is quite different  
from other applications, but that's mostly because I'm a really lame  
GUI programmer....

Lens distortions don't always cause misalignment in panoramas, as  
long as you overlap where the distortions match.  However, you will  
get a kind of "waviness" to lines going from one image to the next  
due to the uncorrected barrel distortion.  You are best off  
experimenting with a few different lenses to see the results.  I  
don't really have enough experience at this point to advise you past  
that.

Regarding image exposure, Photosphere uses the sample-to-nits value  
(a.k.a. EXPOSURE setting) in an HDR file to rectify the brightness  
scale between images.  This may not work if your images were  
assembled by a program other than Photosphere or hdrgen, or if you've  
manipulated the images with an application that doesn't keep track of  
this setting.  (Most image editors that work on HDR such as Photoshop  
CS2 and HDRShop don't.)

For 24-bit RGB (standard LDR) images, you really need to nail the  
exposure and keep it fixed on manual throughout your sequence.  If if  
it were possible to correct for different exposures, you would have  
issues with clamping differently in the highlights in many cases.

The panorama stitcher in Photosphere does a better job than most at  
hiding gradient differences between images, so things like lens flare  
are not the usual disaster.  Instead of seeing a seam or strong  
gradient, you may notice an erratic line where the two images are  
stitched together.  That's the way this algorithm looks, I'm afraid.   
Sometimes it looks better than a smooth blend, and sometimes it's  
worse.  It really depends on the scene.

So if I do a little experimentation ahead of time and establish a  
manual set of exposures, and do that same set across all of the  
images I intend to stitch together, it sounds like Photosphere will  
make the HDRs and combine them in a way that will take care of  
balancing the exposure (tone-mapping exposure) across the panorama.

Also - for anyone trying it out, it took me a few tries to figure out  
that you have to select (click-drag) a small portion of the scene  
when designating matching feature points (versus simply clicking on a  
feature).

Re: barrel distortion - it sounds like if I try to take all of my  
LDRs into Photoshop and use the Lens Correction filter to remove  
barrel distortion, then I will lose important image info that  
Photosphere uses to do its magic.  I'll try a couple of different  
focal lengths with a simple LDR panorama and see what I get wrt  
stitching distorted images.  I'll also try varying the overlap amount.

Pretty cool.

Hi Kirk,

Just to clarify -- you don't have to take a matching set of exposures  
if you're shooting your panoramas in HDR.  Just do whatever you have  
to to get a good set of exposures in each direction, and they should  
stitch together fine.  It's only LDR images that require manual  
settings, and you only get one in that case, so you need to choose  
carefully.

I thought about choosing feature points instead of areas, but the  
feedback would have been difficult since Photosphere doesn't show you  
what point you've chosen and forgets when you switch between images.   
I find myself going back and forth to check my feature selections,  
and if they were missing or always disappearing it would only make  
the process more painful....

Hi Greg,

I tried out the latest function in Photosphere and was able to pretty  
quickly get good results from an LDR image set, but then I threw your  
new toolset a curve by extracting multiple rectilinear images (no  
lens distortion) from an otherwise happily stitched HDR original. (I  
did this because all my panos are shot with fisheye lenses, and I was  
just playing around...).

The results of this experiment are "mixed" to say the least. The HDR  
is retained (yay!) and out of the 4 image used there were minimal  
artifacts (this coming from a longtime Panotools/ Stitcher/ QTVRAS  
abuser), and only one seam was "erratic" and it seems to be in an  
area of high detail (buildings). You can see the results of this test  
(in JPEG-HDR) here:

http://www.mab3d.com/temp/ot3d/panotest1.jpg

I'll admit that this isn't a "fair" image, since only pinhole cameras  
(and in this case, Flexify 2) can create rectilinear images  
naturally, but overall it seemed to be a success. Yes, the interface  
for putting the pano together is nebulous and "well-hidden," but then  
its not supposed to be Hugin or AutopanoPro. When the rain stops, I  
can dig out the 18-55 "kit lens" and do some HDR tests with a "real"  
lens. (Maybe I'll go up to the rooftop putting green again...)

Hi Mark,

Nifty.  I think this is one of the first times I've gotten to  
download a JPEG-HDR image from someone else!  The stitcher works much  
better in natural scenes than cities and the like, which tend to get  
the jitters.  I might come up with some way to calm down the edge  
matching at some point, but I haven't figured out how just yet.

A friend here at work does a LOT of (LDR) panoramas uses a relatively 
inexpensive device called the "panosaurus" 
(http://gregwired.com/pano/Pano.htm) to help with his panorama 
sequences.  I don't think the device addresses the issue you are 
speaking to here, but I thought I'd mention it, since my friend's images 
look amazing (www.mountainworks.net).

Wow, Rob.  Your friend has some awesome photos, there!

The stitching algorithm I developed can mostly work around parallax  
errors in the input images, so a pano head isn't really necessary.   
I'm a fairly haphazard photographer myself, and rarely find myself at  
the top of some mountain with a full compliment of lenses, tripod and  
attachments.  I just carry my little camera around and occasionally  
wind up someplace that looks like a good spot for a panorama or an  
HDR image (or both), and I start shooting.  By no small coincidence,  
Photosphere is just right for people like me.

For pros, there is much better software available, and some of it is  
free.  Photosphere may be the only one that stitches HDR at the  
moment, but I don't expect that to be true for very long.

Actually, Hugin 0.5 for OS X and Linux (not sure about the Windows  
version) can read, stitch and output 32-bit files, but it is far from  
easy-to-learn. Last I checked it could only open Log-Luv TIFFs, but I  
believe Pablo is adding Radiance and OpenEXR to 0.6. Hugin is  
opensource and available here:

http://hugin.sourceforge.net/

For a while Hugin 0.5 was how I transformed stitched HDR spherical  
panoramas into a form that made it easier to retouch the top and  
bottom of the maps. Now I use the Photoshop plug-in Flexify 2 from  
Flaming Pear. It transforms 32-bit files as well into all kinds of  
useful remappings...

Hey Greg,

Wow, this is impressive. Is it possible to assemble spherical panoramas 
based on shots captured with the Sigma 8mm?

Regarding Martin's question, I will present a poster in Boston at the  
Symposium on Applied Perception in Graphics and Visualization <http:// 
www.apgv.org/>.  This symposium happens right before Siggraph and is  
collocated, so it's a fun thing to do if you're planning to attend  
Siggraph anyway, or live in Boston.  I don't know if or when I'll get  
around to publishing a proper paper on it.  I'm past the CIC deadline  
this year, and I'm not up on the image processing literature so I  
feel a bit embarrassed about submitting it to the GVIP journal or  
someplace like that.

As for Jack's question on fisheye panoramas, I don't think  
Photosphere will work all that well in general.  Mark Banas posted  
something just yesterday where he had managed to "undistort" a couple  
of fisheye images and provide them as input to Photosphere and it  
worked reasonably well.

My preference when using fisheye inputs for image-based lighting and  
the like is to perform the coordinate mappings and corrections  
directly in Radiance, and handle it as part of the rendering  
process.  I posted an example of this in January to the HDRI list  
under the grab-bag subject "Mac-Mini | Photosphere | VNC".

Very cool.  i leave for London tomorrow and I am bringing my camera  
and tripod - anyone have any suggestions/requests for good locations?

I am not very familiar with the city (i have been there once, when i  
was 14) but I will have about 1 1/2 days for non-business related  
stuff.  I'm bringing a Powerbook too, so i'll get to try out the  
stitching in the hotel to perfect my technique!

thanks greg!

The cupola at St. Paul's is an awesome spot to shoot from.  Leave the  
tripod in the hotel though; you won't want to haul to up all the  
steps, and you won't have room up there to set it up anyway.

Cool!  Have fun, London's a fantastic city.  I haven't been there in  
three years, but hope to go back in September for the annual Radiance  
Geekfest.

I have a little (full height but collapses to less than 12 inches  
tall, 3 inches in diameter) tripod, so we'll see.  That looks like a  
great place to take in the city - nice!

Hey folks - I had some LDR fun with the panoramic stitching features  
recently added to Photosphere.  See:

http://kirkt.smugmug.com/gallery/1473939

It is interesting to play around with choosing the pano orig and pano  
dest points under various circumstances.  It is interesting to see  
how Photosphere fuses the images, especially when there are distinct  
foreground and background elements with various levels of distortion  
due to focal length.  I was using a cheap little foldup tripod.  I  
found that it is probably worthwhile to get a tripod with a level so  
you don't get a tilt angle and have to crop up significant amounts of  
the image.  I will probably also look into the panoramic tripod  
attachments that permit panning about the lens nodal point.  Cool  
stuff.  I am pleased with it so far - I will probably try to recreate  
the same panos in PSCS2 and see how they work out for comparison.

A couple of quick HDR panorama tests, reduced to LDR JPEG:

http://kirkt.smugmug.com/photos/71901716-L.jpg

http://kirkt.smugmug.com/photos/71891370-L.jpg

I didn;t have much time to shoot, so they are little rough, but  
pretty cool to be able to stitch HDR together.  Greg, how come there  
is so much color wackiness in the higher dynamic range areas - the  
colors get way over-saturated and the contrast goes south pretty  
quickly - I'm guessing that multiple exposures of the HDR with some  
layer masking and compositing may give better results.  I tried  
messing with the tone map curve in PShop CS2, but that will take some  
getting used to.

neat-o!

Hi Kirk,

Nice panos!  The color strangeness is just the usual problem related  
to a global tone-mapper like the one in Photosphere.  To preserve  
local color and contrast, you need to use a local tone-mapping  
algorithm.  Unfortunately, I don't have any to offer at the moment.

Erik Reinhard has implemented a bunch (including his own) and put the  
source code on the HDR Imaging book's DVD-ROM if you want to give  
those a try.

-Greg

Hi folks - Here is another HDR panorama:

http://kirkt.smugmug.com/photos/72305493-L.jpg

I am experimenting with the excellent tone mapping operators on the  
DVD included with Greg at al's HDRI book - really cool stuff.

The above image was mapped using the <tm_photographic> tone mapping  
on the DVD.  It did a nice job of keeping the color shifts under  
control so I could play with curves and saturation on the mapped  
image without getting too weird results.  If you would like to take a  
look at the full size image (5000 px wide) it is here:

It really is a testament to Photosphere's stitching ability.  Greg -  
what a great tool, I can't believe how abusive my images are to your  
app with seemingly little fuss and excellent results.  Awesome.  I  
will post another image (not panorama) with all of the tone mapping  
operators and their DEFAULT output (not necessarily optimal - I need  
to read the chapters on the book to get a handle on all of the  
parameters).

sweet stuff - thanks Greg.
