Subject: [HDRI] Photosphere 1.7 released
Message-ID: <13A44E30-A95E-484D-871A-69DE7619B44D@lmi.net>

Hi All,

The HDRI list has been pretty quiet of late, so I figure it's time  
for an announcement.  I just updated Photosphere to version 1.7 at  
<www.anyhere.com>.  The biggest changes are to the HDR build  
function, which now has a "Skip Exposures" check box to eliminate  
unneeded exposures.  The alignment algorithm also takes a little  
longer now, but does a better job in most cases if there is  
detectable rotation between exposures.  If anyone runs across  
problems with this new feature, let me know.  I did not offer a way  
to selectively disable rotational alignment vs. the standard  
(translational) alignment algorithm.  It's either both or neither  
right now, and that's how I prefer to leave it.

Enjoy.
-Greg

Significant changes since 1.6 include:
---------------------------------------------------
Added the ability to expand the matte surrounding a panorama, trim
inside corners, and a second complimentary color.

Added option to fill the uneven areas around panorama with randomly
selected pixels, which mostly hides the fact that the result is
non-rectangular.

Fixed it so Photosphere can read a record list with nothing
more than the location (directory) and file name fields.

Added check for capitalization and typing errors on keyword,
subject, owner, and album entries.  Added check for duplicate
keywords and comments in info window entries.

Fixed problem combining HDR images for some Nikon cameras, which
insist they have different flash conditions even though the flash
never fires.

Made it so control key works as well as option key for bringing
up thumbnail detail window on image in browser window.

Added recognition and proper display conversion for Adobe RGB
files (JPEGs) using conventional Exif identifiers.  HDR output
is converted to CCIR-709 linear RGB space.

Added option for automatically skipping redundant, over- and
under-exposed images in an HDR capture sequence.

Added mode message to indicate when user is in a particular album.

Added auto-rotation of JPEG and TIFF images on input, TIFF on output.

Added understanding of 35mm-equivalent focal length in Exif header.

View parameters are now written out to Radiance files even
if the image has been cropped and/or rotated.  (The view
up vector still isn't right after rotation.)

Added automatic rotational alignment to HDR build function.

Hi, i am doing a project on flare&ghost removal in HDR Images, and would 
need some different algorithms for comparison. So if you have any good 
links/own algorithms you could share with me, i would be extremely grateful.

Thanks,

JK

Hi JK,

I'm not free to share source code, but you are welcome to download  
the application, Photosphere (for Mac OS X) and/or hdrgen (for OS X  
and Linux) from <www.anyhere.com>.  Both programs will do ghost and  
flare removal, as well as automatic exposure registration/alignment.

-Greg

Hi JK,

My student Erum Khan has worked on an alternative
approach for ghost removal. Paper is online at:

   http://graphics.cs.ucf.edu/ekhan/data/ghost/icip06.pdf

Hope this helps.

Cheers,
Erik

Looks like someone discovered robust estimators.
Check out the existing literature on robust estimators -- I think there are better ones available.
