Journal of Visual Communication and Image Representation

Special Issue on High Dynamic Range Imaging

High dynamic range imaging (HDRI) is an emerging technology, which has the 
potential to bring a new revolution in digital imaging. In HDRI, the image 
files record the actual colour and dynamic range of the real world scene 
rather than the limited gamut and dynamic range of the monitor or other 
reproduction media. This means that image processing, manipulation, 
display, recognition and other operations will no longer be limited by the 
number of bits used to represent each pixel. Therefore, HDRI will have 
widespread applications in digital cinema, digital photography, computer 
games, etc., and will open up many new possibilities, including 
dramatically improving the visual realism of digital photographs and 
videos, enabling the development of more accurate computational vision 
techniques, etc. Many in academic and industry have advocated that the 
future of digital photography and video is high dynamic range imaging. It 
is anticipated that in the next decade, the imaging industry will 
inevitably move to HDRI which will affect all aspects of the imaging 
pipeline, from capture (sensor, camera), to storage (compression coding) to 
reproduction (rendering, tone mapping, printing and display). New image 
processing and computational vision algorithms will also be developed 
around this new emerging imaging paradigm.

This special issue will highlight new research directions and the latest 
technological advancement in high dynamic range imaging and video by 
collecting papers in all relevant areas of HDRI. We invite researchers and 
practitioners to submit their original unpublished work to this special 
issue. We solicit papers dealing with high dynamic range imaging subtopics 
drawn from all stages of the high dynamic range imaging pipeline. This 
includes, but is not limited to, the following topics

Subject: [HDRI] calibrating HDR pictures with real world luminance
Message-ID: <002601c6e1a8$d5c0b750$0164640a@eclipse>

Hi!
 
I am experimenting with HDR images and a luminance meter to see how tone
mappers can actually help reproducing human perception.
 
Here is what I  am currently  doing:
 
a)capture a serie of LDR images using a Canon Rebel XT, only changing the
shutter speed, with constant Fstop,  saved as JPG with sRGB profile
b)creating a calibration curve in HDR Shop
c)measuring a few points in cd/m2 with a luminance meter (LS-110)
d)making an HDR image out of the LDR images using the calibration curve
e)experimenting different tone mappers available on the DVD of the HDRI book
from our favorite well known HDRI gurus.
 
Here are a few questions that puzzles me still:
 
1)  I am trying to scale my HDR image to the measured physical  values.  I
found somewhere that luminance = 179 * (R*0.265 + G*0.067 + B*0.065).  Can I
assume that this equation is the one to use to scale my HDR file properly?
 
2) In some references, it is mentionned that I should always capture LDRs
with a Daylight white balance.  Is this the general agreement?  Even if my
scene is lit with tungsten lights?
 
3)I found limited explanation on how the camera calibration curve would
affect the results in HDR Shop.  I would have to think  that this is to
linearize the color values (remove the effect of Gamma + CMOS response) so
luminance measurements can be actually applied to the colors later on.
 
4)HDR Shops refers to Fstops in the UI.  However,  I read that you want to
maintain Fstops constant and only change the shutter speed.  The problem I
have is that the interpreted Fstops of HDR Shop turn into some "arbitrary"
numbers and I can't really type-in the values used by my camera.  
 
I am not too sure if I am using the right methods.   Some "cook  book" would
be handy.
 
Best regards,

Hi,

You may want to look at the validation study at:
Inanici MN. ?Evaluation of High Dynamic Range Photography as a Luminance Measurement Technique?, Journal of Lighting Research and Technology, Vol. 38, no. 2, June 2006, pp. 123-136.

Another version of this study is available at:
http://repositories.cdlib.org/lbnl/LBNL-57545/

This study evaluates Photosphere rather than HDRShop, but you can find information regarding your first 3 questions.

Hope this helps... Regards,
Mehlika

In my operating experience, it is easier to control color (workflow) - 
even if there are no "outside" image areas.
Though, you can always correct WB in HDRShop (->Pixels->WB selection)

This is also my understanding.

I personally would be interested to see, how far Photomatix would 
support you with this task:
The new version reads EXIF data, resulting in "normalized" HDR images. 
Basic idea behind is to make tone mapping in a panorama workflow easier, 
but it should also make your task easier reproduceable.
I didn't invest much time to test this functionality, but as far as i 
found out, it turned out to be useful when using panos for IBL (i don't 
have to fiddle that much with exposure correction)...

Bernhard

Hi,

That study is a very interesting read. Thank you for the link. And  
thank you for taking the time to do this elaborate analysis in the  
first place.

It makes me wonder how closely your Mathlab algorithm for calculating  
the luminance is related to the Photosphere's algorithm. Does the  
determined 10% average accuracy apply to Photosphere's luminance  
readout as well, provided we work off a good calibration curve?

Also, I find it interesting that the error is higher for primary  
colors, with Red going up to 40% sometimes. Those really seem to  
drive up the average a lot. Could the limited gamut of the Radiance  
format itself have an influence here? Or is it really all due to the  
cameras internal demosaicing and JPEG compression? Could this error  
be minimized by shooting RAW pictures instead?

Regards,
Christian

Hi,

The luminance calculation given in the paper (as Matlab algorithm) should be exactly the same as Photosphere uses to calculate luminance. Greg is the only person to verify this I guess :)

The calculations are based on CIE chromaticities for the reference primaries (sRGB) and CIE Standard Illuminant D65:

         R (x, y ,z) = (0.64, 0.33, 0.03)
 	G (x, y, z) = (0.30, 0.60, 0.10)
 	B (x, y, z) = (0.15, 0.06, 0.79)
 	D65 (x, y, z) = (0.3127, 0.3290, 0.3583)

In Radiance on the other hand, calculations are based on equal energy white point. Equal energy (x, y, z) = (0.33 0.33 0.33).

That is the reason for minor difference between original Luminance calculations in Radiance (R*0.265 + G*0.067 + B*0.065) and the calculation in the paper       (R*0.2127 + G*0.7151 + B*0.0722). My two cents is that the difference in between those two equations is quite minor.

It is true that the saturated colors in Macbeth chart yielded increased errors. 
RAW format might result in better results, but I don't have enough data to claim that... My limited trials with RAW formats looked quite promising though.

Some of the folks in this group may comment on their experience with RAW format, may be?

Regards,
Mehlika

As Mehlika points out, there are slight differences in destination  
color spaces to account for, but the major one is actually in the  
camera itself.  Most manufacturers spend a fair amount of time  
"tuning" their cameras' colors to have a more pleasing, photographic  
look, without regard to color accuracy.  In general, I have found the  
Canon DSLRs to stick fairly close to the sRGB specification,  
especially if a "Neutral" color setting is used.  Nevertheless,  
working from RAW images is a reasonable way to get around most of the  
in-camera processing that undermines absolute CIE color accuracy.

I do not believe that HDRShop does anything to the camera's color  
space, other than an attempt to linearize the three channels.  The  
same is true of Photosphere, although it does attempt to get an  
absolute luminance calibration, and provides features for inputting  
your own per-camera or per-image luminance calibration factor.  If  
you use dcraw.c or Photoshop's RAW converter in "don't touch" sRGB  
calibration mode, you should get out something reasonably close to  
the sRGB primary color space, provided you have shot with a daylight  
white balance.  (See note below on WB settings.)  I have had good  
luck using dcraw myself, and found it's color transformations to be  
fairly reliable.  (See Dave Coffin's website on dcraw.c at <http:// 
cybercom.net/~dcoffin/dcraw/> for code and related links.)  Neither  
HDRShop nor Photosphere can unscramble the eggs once the colors have  
been messed around in a typical digital camera, and I suspect this is  
behind the large delta's in Mehlika's report for primary colors.

Regarding white balance, shooting in daylight mode assures that your  
measurement condition matches the sRGB color space, so you have some  
home of getting out absolute colorimetry, which naturally will  
include any coloration due to the light source.  In other words, the  
camera will measure something like what you would measure with a  
chroma meter.  If instead you apply an appropriate white balance  
setting, e.g. incandescent under tungsten lighting, the camera  
performs some sort of von Kries transform (one would hope), bringing  
neutral colors back to the D65 white point of sRGB.  The problem then  
is that you would have to know exactly what transform was applied to  
get back to absolute colors, and in general you cannot know.  For my  
work, I shoot with the appropriate white balance when what I care  
about is appearance in my HDR results, and I shoot with D65 when I'm  
going for color (and luminance) measurements.  Remember that white  
balance will affect the luminance values as well.

GRegory,

Thanks for your elucidation about WB! Now i'm able to understand my 'observations' :-)

Regards
Bernhard

No problem.  I also meant to respond to Christian's question about  
color gamut.  While it's true that some colors may fall outside the  
RGB gamut of sRGB and/or Radiance RGBE files, this is mostly  
restricted to saturated purples and aquamarines.  Red, orange, and  
fairly saturated green are well-covered in an HDR image.  If you want  
to capture a larger color gamut, I recommend shooting in Adobe RGB if  
your camera supports it or shooting RAW and converting to Adobe RGB  
in Photoshod, then combining exposures with the latest version of  
Photosphere (1.6.5), writing the file out either as OpenEXR or TIFF  
to avoid gamut clamping.  (Versions before 1.6.3 dated 8/19/2006  
didn't support Adobe RGB properly.)

-Greg

That was supposed to be "Photoshop", not "Photoshod" -- don't know  
how I messed up that badly.  I meant no disrespect, and I suppose I  
should put a trademark beside the name each time I use it, though  
it's already in danger of becoming a dictionary word anyway, at which  
point trademarks are invalid...

Thank you for that explanation.
My Nikon does support Adobe RGB, and that sounds like a good  
compromise of speed and quality. I will do some testing with RAW, too.
