Hi all

I'm searching for an automated image aligner for handheld HDRI Shots. 
I'm not satisfied with the automaic mode of Photomatix for example.

Thanks in advance
Jan Weigand

Hi Jan,

What you're looking for is a feature in the new Photoshop CS3 
Extended. I have been very happy with the results.

If going to CS3 Extended is to much for you, may also want to give Artizen
HDR a spin. It has shown on many occassions to be far superior to both CS3
and Photomatix and transformation misalignment. That being said CS3 does
have a decent rotation correction alogrithm.

Examples of some tests ppl have performed.

Thanks for the tip on Artizen...it looks like a nice application, 
unfortunately it's PC only.  I won't be able to test it out until I 
upgrade to an Intel Mac.

You might want to have a look at ALE (Anti Lamenessing Engine). Start here:
