Subject: [HDRI] OT: PostDoc position - Removal of Ghosting Artifacts in High
	Dynamic Range Images

A postdoctoral position is available at Laboratoire d'Informatique de Robotique et de 
Micro?lectronique de Montpellier, UMR CNRS 5506, France, to develop and investigate algorithms for 
removing ghosting artifacts that arise when merging differently exposed photographs of a moving 
scene into a High Dynamic Range image.

This work in the field of High Dynamic Range Imaging will be carried out in the context of a project 
between HDRsoft Sarl and ICAR team of LIRMM Laboratory.

The project involves analyzing the publications on the topic, understanding the strengths and 
weaknesses of existing algorithms, and researching techniques to improve them.  It also involves 
identifying the different types of ghosting in order to propose a classification with the appropriate 
approaches for each type. The goal is to devise algorithms that properly address all types of 
ghosting artifacts.

Requirements:
?       PhD in computer vision, image processing or allied field.
?       Excellent mathematical and analytical abilities
?       Good programming skills in C or C++

Beginning: October 2007
Duration: One year fellowship
Location: ICAR team, LIRMM, Montpellier

RESEARCH ASSISTANT Post REF: ROP2306

24,402 - 26,666 per annum, (english pounds) depending on skills and
experience. In first instance fixed term for 1 year (maternity cover).

This post is funded via the EPSRC award "High Dynamic Range for High
Fidelity Image Synthesis of Real Scenes". The aim of this project is to
compute and display the highest fidelity computer-generated images of real
scenes.
You should have proven programming skills in C++ or Matlab and
enthusiasm for problem solving and research. Under the guidance of Dr Bloj
you will develop a BRDF (Bi-directional Reflectance Distribution Function)
capture system based on digital photography, implement the corresponding
model in a rendering package (preferably RADIANCE) and support the
psychophysical evaluation of the resulting images using standard displays
and a Brightside DR37-P High Dynamic Range Display.
This represents an exciting opportunity for a promising researcher to join
a vibrant interdisciplinary team with partners at the Warwick Digital Lab
and Brightside (now part of DOLBY) working on the development and
validation of High Dynamic Range capture and display systems. The
successful applicant will be based in Dr Bloj's lab in the University of
Bradford, UK.

Informal enquires can be made to Dr Marina Bloj. Tel +44 (0)1274 236258;
e-mail: M.Bloj@bradford.ac.uk or Dr Alexa Ruppertsberg +44 (01274 235378;
e-mail A.I.Ruppertsberg@bradford.ac.uk .

CLOSING DATE: 13th August 2007. We expect to interview during the week of
20th August. Job reference ROP2306.
