Subject: [HDRI] If you were a Photosphere Newbie...
Message-ID: <fc6fb3750703220314t750f3c21xcbcfd2a4eabed0e7@mail.gmail.com>

what would you want to see in the Photosphere documentation?

I'm helping Greg with writing the help docs for Photosphere, and
figure it's time to ask around and see what questions may be out
there.

Thus far we've got some information down on how to browse and catalog
images; how to assign keywords, subjects, etc.; and the beginnings of
"tutorials" for how to make HDR images from static images and how to
make panoramas.  In the near future, we'll also cover how to import
and export images and records.

Anything else?

Even if you're not a newbie, that's ok -- what do YOU think would be
helpful?  What did you struggle with when you first started using it?
What do you still struggle with?

Lastly, is anyone interested in reading the drafts and giving feedback
on what's already written?

TIA!

Judy

Hi Judy,

Thank you for taking the time to develop the documentation of  
Photosphere!

- Actual content in the Help Viewer system... ;-)

I'm sure you already have these in there, but I'd like to see:
- what a "lock" file is and why it shows up on the desktop
- a "dummy's" explanation of the False Color display and Histogram  
information (S. Dev., etc.)
- making an HDR from images without EXIF info (setting ASA, exposure  
time, etc. manually)
- what functions *can* be "undone" and which critical ones (clearing  
a record, etc.) *cannot.*

Sure! Send it on over... but be warned, I use lots of red pixels in  
my comments!

Absolutely, yes.

Everything you're working seems like the right direction for the help 
files.  Thanks, Judy!
