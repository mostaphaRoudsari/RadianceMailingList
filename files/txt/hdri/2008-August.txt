Hello-

 

Is anyone aware of any companies that are producing HDR displays for
purchase?  I am aware of Brightside, which was acquired by Dolby.  I
have tried getting in touch with Dolby, but their response was that they
are not manufacturing displays for sale, only licensing the technology
to display manufacturers.  It does not seem that any manufacturers have
produced one for market yet though.  Any help on locating one would be
appreciated.

 

Thanks

Matt

SIM2, an Italian company, demonstrated a prototype of the Dolby/Brightside technology in April.  No word, yet, on production, but you might contact them; you might be able to get the use of a prototype.

Dear Greg,

congratulations on your latest achievement:

Sounds like a rather nifty idea. Simple yet effective, and it doesn't
require any fancy kit. Well done.

Regards

Axel
