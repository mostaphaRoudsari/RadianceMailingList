Hi,

Enclosed please find a call-for-papers for APGV'08: FIFTH SYMPOSIUM
ON APPLIED PERCEPTION IN GRAPHICS AND VISUALIZATION
APGV'08 would be very interested in submissions from the HDRI field
with some perception component.

Best wishes,

----------------------------------------------
APGV'08: FIFTH SYMPOSIUM ON APPLIED PERCEPTION
IN GRAPHICS AND VISUALIZATION


Co-located with ACM Siggraph in Los Angeles, USA
9th - 10th August, 2008
http://www.apgv.org


FIRST CALL FOR PARTICIPATION
----------------------------

Research in computer graphics and visualization has great potential
to benefit from, and contribute to, research in perception.
Since 2004, this symposium has brought together researchers
from the fields of perception, graphics, and visualization, to facilitate
a wider exchange of ideas.

Submissions are invited in the broad range of areas at the intersection
of computer graphics, visualization, and perception to fulfill two goals
of this multidisciplinary community.

Goal 1. Use insights from perception to advance the design of methods
for visual, auditory and haptic representation. Specific examples include,
but are not limited to:

* applications of insights from perception to the development of algorithms
for more efficient, effective or realistic modeling, rendering and/or 
animation
* applications of perception in the design and evaluation of methods for 
more
effective representation and communication of data
* computational aesthetics, stylization and perceptual aspects of 
non-photorealistic
rendering
* perceptual issues arising due to fusion of digital imaging, computer 
vision,
and computer graphics techniques
* perception-inspired interfaces for immersive activities in virtual worlds

Goal 2. Advance and facilitate novel basic perception and cognition 
research that uses
and is relevant to applications in computer graphics and visualization. 
Here specific
examples include, but are not limited to:

* perception and visuomotor control in computer games, virtual
and augmented environments
* fundamental contributions in spatial and temporal vision
* integration of empirical perception research with computational models
* color vision and color appearance modeling
* the influence of attention and eye movements on visual perception and 
visual memory
* statistical learning and perception of natural scenes
* perception of shapes, surfaces and materials
* visual illusions and perceptual organization having potential to 
enhance image depiction

Proceedings, which will include the poster abstracts, will be published by
ACM SIGGRAPH. Best papers from the symposium will be invited
to be extended for a special issue of the ACM Transactions on Applied 
Perception.
http://www.acm.org/tap/

By collocating APGV 08 with the thirty-fifth annual SIGGRAPH Conference
(SIGGRAPH 08), we aim to further promote communication between
the core perception and the core computer graphics communities,
and also bring APGV back to the United States.

Subject: [HDRI] camera + fisheye
Message-ID: <7.0.1.0.2.20080123092227.0266d0a8@uclouvain.be>

Dear HDR users

I am considering to buy a camera + fisheye in 
order to make luminance measurements (mostly 
daylight scenes) and calculation of glare indexes.
The camera seller said me that the only solution 
to have a full 180? view is the combination of 
the sigma f3.5 fisheye + a full format numeric 
camera (called 24/36 like with analogic cameras) 
and the cheapest one is the CANON EOS 5D (around 2500 euros).
I know that some of did some daylight measurement 
with cheapest camera. Who can help me with that topic ?

Thanks a lot

Magali

Subject: [HDRI] Fisheye  Lense + IBL with HDR image question.
Message-ID: <4797B818.3000006@broadviewnet.net>

Hi Magali,

Sigma just released a 4.5 mm 180 degree fisheye for APS-C size (the 
smaller sensors) digital SLR cameras.
http://www.sigmaphoto.com/news/news.asp?nID=3377

I just received one yesterday from B+H photo in New York and so far it 
seems to deliver as promised. I'm using it with a Nikon D50.

Question (sorry if this is back to basics but despite many archive 
searches I'm still at a loss):
When viewing an HDR image with "ximage" and taking spot measurements 
with the "L" command I get reasonably accurate luminance values.  When I 
map the HDR image as an emissive glow on to a "source" geometry and view 
the scene with "rvu" I get much lower luminance values than at the same 
spots measured in ximage.  Below is the scene description:

Message-ID: <200801232112.m0NLCBpR007033@mta2.lbl.gov>

Hi Magali!

The SIGMA 8mm fisheye will work on a more reasonably priced camera with a
cropped sensor (usually about factor 1.6 or 1.3), but you won't capture the
full circle of 180deg.
However, I read a while ago that SIGMA is planning to release a full 180deg
fisheye for cropped sensors (like those used in the entry and semi-pro SLR
lines). 
Here are the links: 
http://www.sigmaphoto.com/lenses/lenses_all_details.asp?id=3336&navigator=6
http://www.sigmaphoto.com/lenses/lenses_all_details.asp?id=3337&navigator=6

These can then be combined with the more affordable Canon or Nikon SLR
bodies.

A benefit of a 36x24 sensor (full frame) might be the better low light
sensitivity due to larger photosites (pixels). It might be therefore worth
to give the camera systems of choice a try if possible if they fit your
need.

Cheers,
Timo

If a 3 MP camera will do, and you're not afraid of using a system that
isn't exactly cutting-edge, then you may use a Nikon CoolPix 990 or
995, in combination with a Nikon FC-E8 fisheye lens.

You'll get the cam + lens for around ?/$/? 200 on e-bay. I've used
both systems in the past, and would happily point out the pros/cons of
CP990 vs CP995. They actually differ quite a bit. Let me know if you
would consider this option.

Hi Magali,

I agree with Axel's comment. There are also some new(er) cameras that can use the FC-E8 or FC-E9(an improved version) Check http://nikonimaging.com/global/products/accessory/converter/list.htm  I've used the Coolpix 5000, and they work very well in my experience.

However, be aware that with the latest model (Nikon Coolpix P5100) which I believe can take the fish-eye with an adaptor, you cannot use bracketing in manual mode which can be problematic, but that depends on the application.

Good luck with your measurements, and please keep us posted.
Regards,

Santiago

Hi Chris,

This is more of a Radiance question, I suppose, but the problem is  
that you have an EXPOSURE= value in your header that ximage is smart  
about, but the renderer ignores.  To get absolute values out of rvu,  
either set a factor in your glow to 1/EXPOSURE (in all three  
channels) or "undo" the exposure by passing your picture through  
pfilt with -e set to the reciprocal of the exposure getinfo tells you.

Cheers,
-Greg

P.S.  Having the renderers ignore the EXPOSURE line was a design  
decision to facilitate texture normalization under the more typical  
circumstance when it is being used to modify reflectance.
