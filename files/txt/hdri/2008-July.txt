Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.61.0807071631030.26511@ice.cs.bris.ac.uk>


Hi All,

After lots of hard work on high dynamic range imaging, it is
good to see that the general acceptance of this exciting
technology is on the up, even with amateur and semi-professional
photographers.

There is only one thing that's been bothering me for quite a
while now. In certain circles, especially on the Flickr website,
folks are using tone reproduction operators not only for dynamic
range reduction, but also to achieve a certain 'look'. The problem
I have with this, is that there is now a seemingly large community
that equates HDR with that specific look. This is wrong.

In an attempt to explain what is going on here, I have developed
a micro-site with some comparisons. It is strictly informal, and
gives my personal take on where the photography community appears
to have gone wrong. It is located here:

   http://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/~reinhard/tm_comp/

My aim was to write it such that it will be easy to understand for
a non-technical audience.

I hope that this will be useful to some.

Cheers,
Erik

Thank you for this great resource.

I fought the same fight, not only in writing, but also in promoting  
and hosting Picturenaut (which is using your TMO). Associating HDR  
with a certain look tends to be a beginner's mistake, and it looks to  
me like the situation is improving. It really is less about the  
software, but rather about the judgement abilities of the user. After  
going crazy with surrealistic looks, more and more people seem to get  
into naturalistic tone reproduction. I monitored Flickr very closely  
by leeching the most popular "hdr"-tagged images every month. And  
there no doubt that things are improving. (see http://www.hdrlabs.com/gallery/hotlarger.php) 
. Now about half the images are bearable, 6 months ago it was all  
surrealistic/overdone looks. Education is the key to raise awareness,  
and many photographers actually do use HDR on a professional level now  
in real estate or fine art photography. Michael Freeman's book is also  
hitting this vein, very recommended read.


Cheers,
Christian Bloch

Erik;

That looks like a good start.    But it still reads a bit complex for non-scientists.  Remember, you're addressing teenagers, amateur photographers, and artists (the ones posting ugly images on Flickr).

In the introduction, you should indicate that HDR means High Dynamic Range - you use both, but don't equate them.  I've spoken to several photographers who think HDR is a look, and have no idea that it might mean something else.

On the problem page:  Where is the "executive summary"?  Starting with "Creating an HDR Image" is good for a book on HDR imaging, but not for a teenager with a 3 second attention span.  I would suggest giving them your thesis up front, then going into detail.  (problem summary, solution summary, background, details, summarize again)  And be careful about disparaging specific software.

Where are directions on how to do it right?  You show some examples, and discuss some settings.  But can you point to tutorials, and other sites that host HDR images toned in a non-offensive manner?

Comparison - on the Flickr group, they'd go even farther than your example.  They'd push it until there are more artifacts than image.
And I think you mean "bad rap" not "bad wrap".  You should probably restate your problem at the beginning of this page as well ("HDR is not a style or look", "tone mapped images are supposed to look natural").

Overall, I think you've got the arguments and facts to back them up -- but the presentation needs to be geared toward the intended audience.

I am not sure if it would discourage the targetted audience - but maybe 
one should just write that HDR, which means High Dynamic Range - is not 
really suitable as a format to share for web browser display.

And than go on explaining how to create "good" tone-mapped images.

I do not know anyone who really browses the net for hdr-images. 
Everything seams to be about tone-mapped images.

CU Lars.

Message-ID: <1732469250401700831653@LAPTOP2>

Hello,

just received my new Canon EOS 450D and tried to capture HDR?s via CanonHDRcap.

In the CanonHDRcap.out window I get the following error message:
Canon SDK version 8.2.0 opendend
No Camera found!
Camera Error: ID = 0x0c000080

I have connected the camera via the usb-cable. When I start the camera the EOS Utility Programm starts and sees the camera, so I think there is a connection.

The README.txt says : ... Be shure to set it in the "PC cponnect" mode ... I am sorry, but I have no idea how to handle that.

Thank you very much for any ideas
Martin

Hi Martin,

Unfortunately, the software is not compatible with newer-model Canon  
cameras.  I think John Mardaljevic and his student were working to  
update this software, but you'll have to ask them about it.

Subject: [HDRI] HDRcapOSX re-write for Mac OS X 10.5.x/10.4.x
Message-ID: <2BD1651C-3CFD-44D6-AF3D-A6B1D1D946D6@dmu.ac.uk>

Greg Ward's HDRcapOSX has been largely re-written to accommodate the  
changes in Mac OS X and the Canon SDK since the original version  
appeared. The re-write was carried out by my colleague Denis Fan.
CanonHDRcap is now supported under the Canon EDSDK version 2.4, and  
has been compiled under Mac OS X version 10.5.4 as an universal  
binary, backwards compatible up to Mac OS X version 10.4.x. Some  
modification of the CanonHDRcap are described as follows:
(a) The aperture size by default is set to 4 when it executes;
(b) LDR images are downloaded after the sequence of captures, rather  
than during the sequence;
(c) The ability of downloading both jpeg and raw data from the camera  
after the sequence of captures. If you use this option, by default  
canoncap would only execute hdrgen to generate the HDR image using the  
jpeg sequences.
Otherwise, the operation is as described in the original notes  
(included in the package).
