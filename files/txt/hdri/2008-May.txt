Dear list,

those of you who have been fortunate enough to see one of those
Brightside (now owned by Dolby) HDR displays in action will appreciate
just how desirable they are for any HDR geek. It seems that they are
finally becoming available and affordable, like this (German) news
article suggest:

Depending on just how rusty your Germanic language skills are, you
might want to pass the article through an on-line translator.

Regards

Axel

Hi Chris,

Thanks for writing.  If you want to subscribe to the HDRI mailing  
list at radiance-online, here is the URL:

It's generally pretty quiet, but this sort of discussion is very  
welcome.

The warnings you are seeing in Photosphere are just that -- they are  
just my way of saying, "If the output looks funny, it's not my  
fault."  In particular, the 'Trouble Finding HDR Patch' warning is  
nothing to worry about.  It just means some of your exposures are  
very dark or very light, and there's not much information to be  
gleaned from them in deriving a camera response.  The same is usually  
true of the alignment warning, though small, bright objects like  
light sources may show double-images if the camera wasn't mounted on  
a tripod.  If it was, then you should probably turn alignment off  
altogether.  In the latest version of Photosphere, turning alignment  
off kicks in a new feature to remove "hot pixels" from the output.

If you are not deriving the camera response for the first time,  
during on 'Skip Extra Exposures' in the dialog is a good idea, since  
it will avoid most of these problems.  In fact, you shouldn't see the  
'Finding Patches' error at all if you use a saved response function.   
Hopefully, this is working for you, as following the hints in  
quickstart_pf.txt (part 12) and reusing a saved response is the best  
way to avoid problems.

I should mention that it doesn't really help the process to include  
exposures that have no dark pixels (values all over 20) and no bright  
pixels (values all under 200).  You can use Photosphere's histogram  
viewer to check this and exclude extreme exposures.  This will help  
reduce the number of warnings.

Best,
-Greg
