Subject: [HDRI] using "ptpcam" to automate HDR acquisition [any friendly
	cameras?]
Message-ID: <49609.67.180.140.103.1222332641.squirrel@calmail.berkeley.edu>

Hello all,

I have recently downloaded and installed libptp2-1.1.10 on my mac and am
now using "ptpcam"'s

%ptpcam --list-properties

to see what features on my cannon SD1000 i can control from the command
line. It turns out that i can't control any of the key parameters needed
to take bracketed images (shutter speed, download/delete images etc.)

Is anyone aware of a good digital camera who's settings are controllable
from ptpcam (or similar programs)?

it appears that the Nikon D70 works, as it was implemented at:

http://www.hdrfc.com/software

But the D70 is quite expensive.... Ideally i am looking for the cheapest
camera i can get ($100-150?)

best,

Kyle
