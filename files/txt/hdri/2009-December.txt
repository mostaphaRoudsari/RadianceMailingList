This discussion really belongs on the HDRI mailing list, where you  
might find some additional help.

Dear list members,

I use HDRShop to convert between mappings for environment maps, e.g., 
from mirror ball to lat-long, etc.

I wish to re-map an image taken with a Sigma 8mm 180 degree 
field-of-view fish eye lens. I have taken high-res images
of the sky  with the lens pointing straight up and wish to convert these 
images to lat-long mapping (with 180 degree field-of-view this will give 
me data for the upper half of the 360x180 degree long-lat map)

So far I have used the 'mirrorball closeup' option in HDRShop when 
converting, but I  have now made several experiments and measurements 
which show that interpreting the fish-eye-lens image as "mirrorball 
closeup" is incorrect. In fact the fish-eye-lens image seems to be 
identical to the hemispherical mapping used by RADIANCE when rendering 
with the -vth option.

I am searching for a piece of software which can convert from (cropped) 
fish-eye-lens image to mirrorball closeup (or directly to lat-long). 
Perhaps a plugin for HDRShop?

Best,
Claus



Sincerely,
Claus

Subject: [HDRI] Mapping fish-eye-lens images to lat-long
Message-ID: <4B1E1A44.8020903@imi.aau.dk>

Dear HDRI list members,

I use HDRShop to convert between mappings for environment maps, e.g., 
from mirror ball to lat-long, etc.

I use a Sigma 8mm 180 degree field-of-view fish eye lens on a Canon 1Ds 
Mark II camera to take fish eye lens (FEL) images of the sky.

In HDRShop I use the "mirror ball closeup" option when I convert from 
FEL image to lat-long mapping, but through experiments I have determined 
that the mapping is incorrect. The FEL imaging geometry does not conform 
to "mirror ball closeup" and the resulting lat-long mapping is 
incorrect. For example: when I take FEL images of the sky, and manually 
measure the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, the elevation 
matches if I interpret the FEL image as a hemispherical mapping. If I 
convert (using the mirror ball closeup option) the FEL image to lat long 
in HDRShop the elevation is not correct anymore (e.g, 7 degrees in 
lat-long map, 20 degrees in reality).

I am searching for a program that can convert my FEL images (produced 
with the Sigma 8mm FEL) correctly into lat-long format. Can anyone help?

Or put more precisely: I wish to convert hemispherical images into 
latitude-longitude format.


Sincerely,
Claus

Not sure where you see think the Mirrorball Closeup is wrong. When cropped right at the 180 deg circle, it fits the bill just fine.

A free alternative is using Hugin: http://hugin.sourceforge.net
Also, there's the Photoshop Plugin Flexify2 (which I prefer for workflow reasons): http://www.flamingpear.com/flexify.html

There's a tutorial on all three methods in my book, pages 282ff. Can get it on www.hdri-handbook.com or on SafariBooks.

Best,
Christian
