Subject: [HDRI] Relationship - Outdoor illumination value, HDR pixel value,

Message-ID: <397184.35745.qm@web51902.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

Hi 

Two different cameras are used for taking the same scene at same time and same day.   If we know the each camera ISO value, shutter Speed and f-stop value and the HDR pixel value of the images produced by them then what is the relationship between them with respect to captured outdoor scene radiance value or how one can compare the radiance value captured by both camera. I will appreciate if one can give some mathematical relationship or formula. 
 
Best Regards,     Brajesh Lal

Brajesh.

You can find information about camera calibration on this site:

http://luxal.dachary.org/webhdr/calibrate.shtml

You have to find the response curve for your individual camera.
With this you can create reasonably accurate HDR images that
could be compared with each other.

Because of the image manipulation that goes on inside of a
digital (consumer) camera, I doubt there is a straight forward
relationship between two picture taken by different cameras.

Hi,

what you want is a HDR image that contains pixel values in photometric
units. To achieve this generate a reasonable response curve, which
compensates for the non-linear response of the sensor to illuminance on
each channel. Second, you should compare the luminance from the pixels
to a reference. One way to do so is using a stabilized light source.
This will give you a factor that can be used as a multiplier to get from
the pixel values to cd/m2.

Besides that, aperture size, focus distance, the lens etc. all have
influence on the pixel values in your image...

Cheers, Lars.

I don't know where you are trying to go with this, but it would take 
some pretty expensive equipment to get a true evaluation.

Just putting low end cameras near the same place will not capture the 
same scene--even with the same manufacturer.

Remember, these are "F" stops, not "T" stops; they are not as precise 
from lens to lens.  They do not need to be.
