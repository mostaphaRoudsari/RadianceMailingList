Subject: [HDRI] ximage and hdri
Message-ID: <9868.190.179.203.60.1243888197.squirrel@lab.cricyt.edu.ar>

I?m a PhD student from Argentina, member of a research team advocated to
the study of natural lighting. We are exploring the HRDI technique and we
found a limitation while using hdrgen and ximage: Only squared shapes are
avaiable to average Luminances, and we need to calculate the mean
Luminances for radial shapes (circular, toroidal) in order to get the
luminance contrast in the field of view.

How can we overcome this? Can we "borrow" the source code of ximage so we
can write a script acording to our needs?
Thank you.

low teck approach, just command line:
I would just generate a mask with photoshop, an image with just white  
and black pixels, but in RGB.
convert it to tiff and then to pic    (ra_tiff -r ).
use pcomb with image 1 and image 2 and write an expression that takes  
value of pixels in your HDR only if they are inside of the mask, all  
the others null (basically multiply image 1 by image 2, check that the  
mask contains 0 and 1 only!).
use pvalue on the filtered image and convert to numbers
use total and get the sum of all data from filtered image, TL
count the white pixels in the mask (pvalue and total for example), TN
TL/TN = average luminance within the mask
....
the whole thing can be written in a script.
and perhaps also put together with a nice sequence of pipes.

Hi Roberto,

Radiance is open source and is available at www.radiance-online.org. The 
program "ximage" is part of the Radiance tool set. Rather than hacking 
ximage source code there may be other ways to calculate the average 
luminances that want. For example it is possible to read in values from 
an image on a per pixel basis, depending on what you are trying to 
accomplish this could be coupled with an image mask to sample only 
selected pixels.

Regards,

-Jack de Valpine

I assume you refer to the interactive command key 'l' to display
luminance of the 'area of interest' which is a rectangular selection
of the image.

If you can calculate the pixel coordinates for your shapes you
can use the command line tool 'pvalue' to get the value of a pixel
at (x,y) of the image. Sum up all the values and divide by the number
of pixels and you have your average.

If you can't calculate those pixel coordinates easily you can
create a black and white mask to isolate the area of interest.
You would then combine the mask and your picture, get the sum
of all pixels in the image but divide by the number of pixels
that are not zero (black).

The source code for ximage is freely available. You can find
the CVS repository online here:

http://www.radiance-online.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/

The ximage source code is located in ray/src/px/.

Wouldn't it be a little faster to just create a mask (selection is easiest in this case) in Photoshop and use the average filter?

Post-Doctoral Position in Image-Based 3D Modeling of Fine Art (RIT/MOMA)

Sponsor: Andrew W. Mellon Foundation

Location(s): The Munsell Color Science Laboratory, Rochester Institute 
of Technology, Rochester, NY and the Museum of Modern Art, New York City

Principal Investigators: Drs. Roy S. Berns and James A. Ferwerda

Project Description: The Munsell Color Science Laboratory (MCSL) at RIT 
is seeking an outstanding researcher for a two-year postdoctoral 
fellowship in the area of Image-Based 3D Modeling of Fine Art. The goal 
of the research is to develop advanced methods for creating rich digital 
representations of paintings and other cultural heritage objects that 
can serve as surrogates for archiving, analysis, restoration, 
reproduction, and scholarship. The fellowship is sponsored by the Andrew 
W. Mellon Foundation as part of a project entitled ?Improving Artwork 
Reproduction through 3D-Spectral Capture and Computer Graphics 
Rendering?. Research resources of the MCSL include a light measurement 
laboratory, a custom imaging goniospectrophotometer, a compute cluster, 
and calibrated spectral printing, display systems, and visual 
psychophysics laboratories. In addition to research at the MCSL in 
Rochester NY, the appointment will include extended residencies at the 
Museum of Modern Art in New York City.

Requirements: Applicants should have a Ph.D. in Computer Science, 
Computer Graphics, Image Processing, or a related field. Applicants with 
research backgrounds in the following areas will be preferred: 
Image-Based Modeling/Rendering/Lighting, Computational Photography, 
Physically-Based Rendering, and Material Appearance. Strong mathematical 
and computational skills (MATLAB and C/C++) and a proven track record of 
independent research and publication are required.

Application Process: Applicants should email a curriculum vitae, and a 
cover letter that describes their graduate training, research interests, 
and qualifications for the position to Ms. Val Hemink (val@cis.rit.edu). 
Applicants should also arrange to have three letters of recommendation 
sent to the same address. Review of the applications will be ongoing and 
will continue until the position is filled.

Salary: Commensurate with experience.
Start date: Negotiable but no later than October 2009.
Duration: Two years.

Message-ID: <94807C8C40894610AD79B0AAD85FCE39@T61>

I am primarily interested in the image analysis features of radiance but have not found any step-by-step instructions for installing the software on a Mac G5 running Leopard. Not interested at this point in the rendering functions. Very interested in using HDR photography for luminance measurements. Would appreciate any references covering these topics. Unix and Matlab naive, although I suppose I could learn!

I have reviewed several articles including Inanici & Galvin 2004 and Beltran and Mogo 2005.

PS There is an useful program, ImageJ, developed at the National Institutes of Health that allows for luminance calibration of pixel values and arbitary selection of image areas for computation of average luminance and other functions. I have used this successfully for contrast measurements of scene objects; however it is limited to LDR images. It is a free download.

Hi Kenneth,

Two words, the second being a URL:

Photosphere at http://www.anyhere.com/

This application does pretty much exactly what you're asking.  For  
command-line image processing, Radiance is useful as well.  You can  
download the executables for Leopard from:

	http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/framed.html

Cheers,
-Greg
