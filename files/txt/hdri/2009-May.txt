Hi Christoph,

I'm cross-posting my reply to the HDRI mailing list, where this  
probably belongs.

I hired a programmer friend of mine to port Photosphere to Windows  
and Linux a few years ago, but she has since had two children and is  
a busy mom.  I'm not sure where that project stands, to be honest.  I  
know it is possible to compile the command-line tool hdrgen under  
Windows with some effort, but it hasn't been done for many a year.

The Canon 5D camera with Sigma fisheye is a good choice, and Sigma  
has a 180-degree fisheye that works on APS sensors now as well, so  
you could get a Nikon D90 (or whatever) and use that as a lower-cost  
alternative.

Cheers,
-Greg

Hi Christoph,

I have a 5D and  Sigma 180 fisheye. I would be happy to bring them by 
sometime if you are interested in checking them out.

Actually, if we are on the topic of porting applications a port of the 
canoncap application would be pretty nice....

Best,

-Jack

Hi All,

I am newbie and I am looking for Canon EOS cameras that we can use with
HDRcapOSX. The ideal EOS model, Canon 5D is quite expensive, so we look for
other (much) low-cost models, such as Canon EOS450D or Canon EOS40D.

Anyone has any idea does they 're matched for Photosphere?

I asked Canon supplier bringing the cameras soon for testing with HDRcapOSX
software (developed by Greg Ward and re-written by Denis Fan). Unfortunately,
we do not have yet an updated Mac OSX 10.4 to run this software, we cannot yet
test with the inexpensive EOS models. If I test it and have any result, I will
keep you list on posted.

Cheers,
Apiparn

Hi Christoph,

We have a canon EOS 40D combined with sigma 4.5 mm F2.8 circular fisheye
(the sigma fisheye Greg is talking about). It's an intermediate-cost
solution.
We use DSLR Remote pro for the capture of images and hdrgen under linux for
the combination into hdr format.

Magali

Is the HDRcapOSX publicly available, and if so, where can it be downloaded?
Greg developed HDRcap for us on an old Mac operating system but we 
havent had the funds to modify the program for the newer operating 
systems.  It'd be great if we could our paws on a newer version.
Cheers, el.

Hi Eleanor,

Denis Fan retooled HDRcap for the latest OS & cameras, I believe.   
You'll have to talk to John M. about getting a copy.

Hi Apipam,

I have no experience with the EOS 450D, but I tested the Canon EOS350D
together with Photosphere and it performed well with respect to luminance
estimation. See

"Accuracy of Luminance Maps Obtained from High Dynamic Range Images" in the
IESNA journal Leukos Vol 4 No 2, Oct 2007, pp. 99-112.

The typical RMSE for colors with low chroma is around 11%, depending on what
gray card you pick (I recommend Munsell N6). The Nikon Coolpix 5400 with a
CCD sensor used to have 20%. The luminance of saturated colors cannot be
estimated. Polychromatic LED illumination is also not suited, but broad
continuous spectra should be ok.

Regards

Martin Moeck

Apologies to Martin and Christian, whose postings to the HDRI list  
were delayed.  You need to make sure that you send from the same  
account you receive the list on, otherwise your e-mail gets  
quarantined until the list manager (me) has a chance to look at it.   
As there's been a sudden surge in spam on the list, I have been  
putting off looking at blocked messages, and didn't notice these were  
in the queue.

Cheers,
-Greg
