Subject: [HDRI] EUROGRAPHICS 2011 - Call for Special Track Papers on High
 Dynamic Range Imaging
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=GVPZGssSCGS=ROLG95C=+27sQZjOmEoNHiAFE@mail.gmail.com>

Eurographics 2011 will be the 32nd annual conference of the European
Association for Computer Graphics. The conference will take place at
Llandudno, Wales on the 11-15 April 2011. Full details of the
conference are at: http://eg2011.bangor.ac.uk/.

We invite contributions that advance the state of the art in the
domain of High Dynamic Range Imaging (HDRI). The topics to be
addressed include:
* Acquisition techniques
* Image manipulation
* Image editing
* Artistic HDR techniques
* Video
* Capture and display hardware
* Quality metrics
* Color
* Encoding and compression
* Tone-mapping
* Inverse tone-mapping
* Display techniques


Important dates:

Submission of papers: December 10, 2010
Notification of acceptance: January 28, 2011
Camera ready due:  February 15, 2011

We invite both paper and sketch submissions. Paper submissions should
be between 4 and 8 pages long and sketch submissions are limited to 2
pages of an extended abstract. Sketch submissions provide a forum for
new innovative ideas that are very relevant to the HDRI community but
are not yet fully polished and ready for a full paper publication.

Both paper and sketch submissions should be formatted according to the
EG conference style. Sketch submissions should include ?Sketch: ? in
the title line to distinguish them from the paper submissions.
Guidance on formatting can be found at
http://www.eg.org/EG/Publications/guidelines

Accepted papers and sketches will be presented at Eurographics 2011
and published in a separate proceedings published by Eurographics.
They will also appear in the Eurographics digital library
(http://www.eg.org/EG/DL).

Hi Jelle,

If you have access to a Mac, you can download Photosphere to do this for you:

	http://www.anyhere.com

Mehlika Inanici has done some work validating the software:

	http://faculty.washington.edu/inanici/MI-RESEARCH.html

You can subscribe to the hdri mailing list or look at older postings for more information.

Cheers,
-Greg

You'll have to go through different steps to calibrate your camera, define and convert to the right color space and you'll need the same picture with several different exposure times to cover the dynamic range sufficiently (depending on what you want to use it for).

Does anyone still use Mirror Balls to create 360x360 hdr panoramic 
images? If so what is your work flow and app of choice, cause i am 
wondering what process ppl use to remove the photographer from the photo?

Hi Thomas!

As this is more about panoramic photography then HDR imaging, I would 
recommend addressing e.g. the panotools mailing-list. I am sure you will 
find a lot of useful hints there:

Cheers, Lars.

My question was in the context of HDR imaging, but thank you for the 
suggestion anyways. As an example a lot of Mirror Balls were used in the 
movie 300 to capture the radiance of the environment.

I have a very detailed tutorial for removing yourself from a mirror ball shot in my book: www.hdri-handbook.com . Basically, you would shoot it from 2 angles (90 deg apart) or better 3 angles (120 deg apart), crop and unwrap each, layer them in Photoshop, use the Filter - Offset to align them all, and then rub through to remove the bad spots.

Not shooting mirror balls anymore. Fullframe fisheye lenses give better quality and enable me to shoot faster on set. (also shown in tutorials in the book.)

Best,
Blochi

Subject: [HDRI] Photosphere on Linux?

Message-ID: <2070419226.46438.1281130939968.JavaMail.root@correo.mendoza-conicet.gob.ar>

Hi from Argentina,
I?working on my PhD in relation to daylight and I am analysing Luminance maps from HDR. I?ve been working with hdrgen but I was recentely able to try photosphere and loved it!

I saw an older topic in this meiling list regarding the posibility of using photosphere on linux or windows.Any news I missed? As a radiance user  I really prefer working on linux, also knowing that both - Mac and linux are Unix systems I  think it wouldnt be too hard to do that (if you know how..)

Is it posible to get the source code of photosphere and compile it on linux? What can I do to use photosphere on linux? 
thanks,
