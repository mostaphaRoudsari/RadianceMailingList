Subject: [HDRI] Anyone experimented with the FCam?
Message-ID: <idr8nk$lgf$1@dough.gmane.org>

The FCam (Frankencamera) is an open-source camera project. It is 
running on Nokia N900s and custom hardware at Stanford. Has anyone one 
this list experimented with it?

<http://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/fcam/html/>

...any word about the FCam F3?

(This is also a test of the new list server.)
