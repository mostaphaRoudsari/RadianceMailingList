 Hi,

I took 7 Cr2 images of the sky with combination of two different f-stops, to get the range 17 stops.
When i assembled them i get blue tint on the final HDR image. What can be the possible reason that i am getting blue color?

You did not give much detail on what you try to do. What are the sky 
conditions - do you have the direct sun on you images? What is Cr2? What 
means blue tint - I would not be surprised if the sky has a blueish 
color, that is what I observe usually.

Cheers, Lars.

As Lars noted, you need to provide a lot more information for anyone  
to help you.  I know that Cr2 files are the raw output of a Canon  
camera, but you did not say what program you used to process them, or  
what options.

Hi Lars,

I was referring the paper"Direct HDR Capture of the Sun and Sky" and try to the experiment. Canon Eos 1Ds Mark II with Kodak Wratten ND filter 3.0 is placed in upward direction to capture the sun and sky images. Almost in 50 sec i took 7 raw images ( Canon CR2 format). f4 - 1s, 1/4 and 1/30 and f16 - 1/15, 1/125, 1/1000, 1/8000. Then calculated relative stops between them and used HDRShop 3.0 ( uses directly CR2 format) to assemble it as HDR image.
The image was having bit surroundings and clear sky was and have direct sun. 
After assembling it i got the entire HDR image with Blue color tint. I was wondering why i am getting that Blue color tint . Is it camera problem or ND filter or assembling software (HDRShop)   or some thing else.


 Best Regards,     Brajesh Lal

This is probably due to the handling of clipped values in the Canon  
raw files in HDRshop, but I can't say for sure as I don't have  
experience with this program.  You could try assembling the images in  
Photoshop (CS3 or higher) to see what happens.

FYI, this list deals mostly with Mac users of Photosphere and related  
tools, so I don't think you'll find many experts on HDRshop, but I  
could be wrong.

Best,
-Greg

I do not know the internals of how this raw format is handled. One thing that comes to my mind is that getting a relieable response curve for the camera over the whole luminance range and for all three channels may be challenging. I do not know what you use to derive the response of the sensor from. If it is a typical greyish indoor scene, you probably cannot do it with the filter in place. If you use the real sunny sky for calculating the sensor response, the different channels may perform different for the direct sun. Just a guess though.

Did you try other software, and did this result in the same blue tint?

Cheers, Lars.

Subject: [HDRI] CanonHDRcap with Canon 5D Mark II
Message-ID: <F74B3184-1663-4186-8B48-0FF544B48A16@lbl.gov>

Hi Everyone,
I was using John Mardelivic's CanonCap script for automated hdr capture on a mac mini with a Canon 5D camera.  Everything was working very well.  

Then I got a new Canon 5D Mark II camera, and it doesn't work.  I think the problem is that the new Mark II  camera doesn't have the ability to select between PC-connect and PTP/print connection.  The CanonHDRcap program used by John's script requires PC-connect (as noted in Greg's original documentation).  When I connect the new Mark II camera I notice a PTPcamera program running in activity monitor.  So I assume the camera uses PTP to connect with the PC.

My questions: 
Has anyone used a Canon 5D Mark II camera with CanonHDRcap?
Does anyone know of a way to get the Mark II camera to connect via PCConnect instead of PTP?

Thanks,
Andy
