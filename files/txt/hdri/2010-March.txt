Subject: [HDRI] Auto capture by HDRcapOSX on a Mac Mini without screen or k/b
Message-ID: <A00C9A08-850C-49D1-8289-6BD01D018FC4@dmu.ac.uk>

How to automate capture using a Mac Mini less k/b and screen

This is for situations where you wish to simply leave a Mac Mini and  
camera at some location to capture HDR images at some fixed interval,  
e.g. every 10 minutes, every hour, etc. Furthermore, it's for those  
times when you'd rather not bring a screen and keyboard just to set  
the process off.

In other words, you simply power up the Mac Mini (and camera) and  
leave it to capture until it is either switched off or a pre-set  
shutdown command is given.  No need for a screen, k/b, wireless  
network or any intervention by the user (other than plugging it in and  
switching it on).
