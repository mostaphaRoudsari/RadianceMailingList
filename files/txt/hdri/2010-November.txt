Hello Roberto,

A good friend of mine has been working on a wxWidgets port to Photosphere for Windows and Linux and has made great progress, but it's not quite ready at this point.  The source code for the Mac version is based on Carbon, which isn't really supported anymore, so it's essentially a dead-end, and useless in a Linux environment, anyway.  It's a lot of work to port a GUI to a new platform, unfortunately, and my friend has been working on it in the background for a couple of years.

Best,
-Greg

As a radiance user  I really prefer working on linux, also knowing that both - Mac and linux are Unix systems I  think it wouldnt be too hard to do that (if you know how..)
