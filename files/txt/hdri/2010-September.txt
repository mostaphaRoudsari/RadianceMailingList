Hi,


I am trying to compare three different images of the same HDRI scene in
Radiance Image Viewer, and I am looking for a way to generate the exact
luminance value pixel reading in each image.  Is there a way to accurately
generate such points selection?

Thanks,
Rashida

Hi Rashida.

Radiance has a tool called pvalue. It will print out the pixel values
of an image in the format "x y r g b". You can use the x and y
position to compare values between images.

Regards,
Thomas

Apologies for the cross posting, just trying to cover the bases.

I have been experimenting with a new camera and Sigma 8mm fisheye lens,
creating HDR images for input to Jan Wienold's/Fraunhofer's evalglare
program. On the really long exposures, you can actually see the back end of
the lens and I guess some of the internals of the camera body itself. While
this is exceedingly cool/interesting, I wonder if this is impacting the
validity of the HDRs. When I create a Radiance HDR image (-vth) I get these
nice round images with totally black corners. With the camera, I end up with
a rectangular image and as I said some luminous pixels on the long
exposures. Is this a problem, and how do folks deal with this in practice?
Even if it's not a problem from an accuracy standpoint, aesthetically it's
nice to produce photos that look like the Radiance fisheye output.

Thanks...

Hi Rob,

You need to check what the values of those border pixels are.  Chances are, they are quite low compared to the circular image, and you are only seeing them because of the tone-mapping compression going on in Photosphere, assuming that's what you're using.

Best,
-Greg

Oh, they are, very low (~2 nits in the HDR), I was just curious because
these corner areas are not truly in the vield of view that we're evaluating.
I ASSume evalglare only is looking at the hemisphere anyway. (?)

Having said all that, does anyone have a masking tip or something like that
to clean up those corners, just out of aesthetic curiosity?

Hi Greg,

I am in the midst of trying to get Evalglare to accurately process HDR
images.  In order to account for light-fall from a Canon + fish-eye
generated HDR, I have tried to multiply by the original HDR image with a
correction factor using the pcomb command.  However, the resulting image
does not maintain similar luminance values as the original (as it should
particularly for the center part of the image that is only multiplied by a
factor of 1).

I am using the following command line and would appreciate any guidance on
why the luminance values are so affected:
pcomb -e "ro=ri(1)*ri(2);go=gi(1)*gi(2);bo=bi(1)*bi(2);" vignette_283.pic
Chauhaus3cr.hdr > Chauhaus3Bvg.hdr

My initial attempt actually used the -o function to normalize the values of
the image before processing, but the resulting vignetted image was very dark
and the luminance values had drastically dropped -- pcomb -e
"ro=ri(1)*ri(2);go=gi(1)*gi(2);bo=bi(1)*bi(2);" -o vignette_283.pic
Chauhaus3cr.hdr > Chauhaus3vg.hdr


As an aside to something Rob mentioned earlier, I do not believe that right
now Evalglare automatically only judges the circular view of the fish-eye
HDR while being processed.  In order to get accurate results, the
rectangular images should be cropped (using pcompos) and also the view type
should be verified before processing.  I have discovered that several of my
Photopshere generated HDRs are being judged as a perspective view rather
than angular fish-eye as I had assumed it would (vtv instead of vta) and
that I had to manually adjust this setting before getting accurate and
meaningful Evalglare results.  (Greg -- is there anyway to specify the lens
type in Photosphere before compiling the HDR so that it follows through from
the beginning?)

Best,
Rashida

Just realized, you should include a "-o" somewhere on the pcomb command line to maintain absolute values, in case the input image has already passed through pfilt or the like with an exposure adjustment.

Some quick responses:

1)  You do need to use the -o option in your pcomb command, but it only applies to the immediately following input file.  Therefore, you need to put the "-o" between your two file names, or change their order to keep the absolute values.  Displaying the output with ximage, you can use the "-e auto" option to bring the values in the the correct range for display (i.e., tone-map the result).

2) There is no easy way for Photosphere to figure out whether a fish-eye lens is being used.  I would have to create a lens database similar to Photoshop CS5's and read the hidden maker tags in the Exif file, and still it would only work "sometimes."  You are better off adding or correcting the VIEW= string as Jan suggests using the "vinfo" command in Radiance.

Cheers,
-Greg
