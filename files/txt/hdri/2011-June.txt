Subject: [HDRI] evalglare changing luminance values??
Message-ID: <6025C928C785944983BD457EB996C1360CE7905673@SG-EXCHMB1>

Good day HDRI list!
I have taken a series of fisheye photos of a completed project in hopes of gathering some data on glare sources as it relates to the special occupancy. So far I have been able to successfully composite them into an HDR with hdrgen. Then, using pcomb, I scaled the luminance values and reduced image size for input into evalglare. The output from evalglare is where I run into problems.

For instance: in my pcomb'd image, I get a local average luminance of 176.3 nits and the same spot in the evalglare image shows 1127 nits. This of course results in false identifications of glare sources by evalglare. Can anyone please explain this phenomenon? Here are my commands used to generate both images:
pcomb -x xmax/4 -y ymax/4 -s 1.175 -o pt2.hdr > pt2_conv.hdr
evalglare -b 2000 -c pt2.glr pt2_conv.hdr (currently interested in glare sources > 2000 nits)

I noticed that hdrgen set the image header to VIEW=  -vtv -vh 104.96 -vv 104.16. I've tried to use vinfo to edit the header to correctly set VIEW= -vta as evalglare would expect, but achieve the same results as mentioned above.

If anyone is interested, I've posted my pcomb image and evalglare image to my GoogleDocs:
pcomb: https://docs.google.com/leaf?id=0Bx321BZMymleNzc5NWRhZjEtZWM5Mi00NjgxLTliZWUtN2RjMTgyMmVjNDhj&hl=en_US&authkey=CJTZnPYI

I appreciate the help I've received from the Radiance gurus on the general list and look forward to hearing your thoughts on yet another issue.
Best,
Chris

Chris,
My feeling is that it could be an exposure tag issue.
I think Santiago presented at one of the Radiance workshop a script to undo exposure compensation, maybe in 2008 
I had a similar issue playing with the files from my camera. (in my case I need to add the aperture tag and play with the multiplier manually (pcomb) to get the right HDR settings, and of course I am using the aforementioned Santiago+Greg script)
I have some more info in the office. WIll come back.

Hi Chris,

The presentation Giulio is referring to was in fact in 2004 (time flies!)
The script is:



#!/bin/csh -fe

# Undo any exposure to one or more Radiance pictures

foreach i ($*)

set expos=`sed -n -e 's/^EXPOSURE=//p' -e '/^$/q' $i | total -p`

pfilt -1 -e `ev 1/$expos` $i > $i.$$

mv $i.$$ $i

end

This was to solve a problem when mapping the hdr into a source (for ibl), but it could be that evalglare has a similar problem if it is not checking the exposure in order to get the values?

Hope this helps,
Santiago

Thanks for the info, it appears that this has fixed the issue! I have only checked a couple of my images, but so far so good.

Thanks again for sharing your experience/expertise.

Hi John,

I have done a quick comparison (probably 7 years ago or so) as I was working on validating Photosphere. It was not a comprehensive comparison but I remember that Photsophere results were more reliable when compared to measurements with Minolta luminance meter, especially with higher luminance values.

Best,
Mehlika

Subject: [HDRI] Accuracy issue from Firefly MV in Photosphere
Message-ID: <CA2112E5.EEE5%kevinv@uidaho.edu>

All,

I have been creating HDR images for purposes of pixel-based luminance
analysis from photographs captured with a PointGrey Firefly MV [FMVU-13S2C
(Color)].  

http://www.ptgrey.com/products/fireflymv/fireflymv_usb_firewire_cmos_camera.
asp 

It is a board level camera with usb 2 connection, uses the Sony IMX035LQR-C
cmos sensor and a rolling shutter.  I have fixed exposure to 1, brightness
to 0, gain to 0, and turned the frame rate off.  I have then run multiple
exposures (10-12) using shutter speeds from 1ms to 8000ms excluding
completely saturated exposures.   I have a fisheye lens attached but have
not been able to run vignetting correction yet since I do not trust my
response curve. I have been running accuracy comparisons to my Canon which I
trust with poor comparisons.  It is successfully resolving in Photosphere,
but only after I manually write the EXIF header since the camera actually
does not write an EXIF header.   I have written camera make, model, f stop,
and shutter into header.

Any ideas?

I would be happy to ftp exposures etc if it would help.

Thanks for any help!

Hi Kevin,

Are you errors in absolute terms or relative (e.g., one patch to another on a Macbeth chart or similar)?

Greg,

Thanks for the reply.  My errors are in absolute terms.  I have a Minolta
luminance meter and a Macbeth grey card in the middle of the scene.  I am
also doing comparisons of absolute luminance values produced by the FireFly
as compared to the luminance results from my Canon camera on images captured
at the same time of the same scene.  I have high confidence in my Canon
results from previous validations.  The HDR that Photosphere resolves for
the Firefly at first look reasonable within the scene ? it has logical
variation in luminance values.  It is the absolute errors that I am worried
about. 

Thanks!

If your relative proportions are accurate, that means Photosphere is doing a good job of solving for the system response.  However, there's no way for it to solve for the absolute calibration.  It just uses a value that is approximate based on ISO, which it sounds like you don't know.  Select a region you've measured and use the "Apply" button to calibrate against your measured luminance.  Use the dialog option to save this factor for your camera and you should be good from then on.  (You'll need to be consistent about the camera make, model, and version in your added Exif header, though.)

Greg,

Thanks - that makes sense.  I just checked and the relative proportions of
the Firefly HDR are substantially different than the relative proportions of
the Canon HDR - bummer.  Looks like I will need to figure out a way to
calculate ISO to input into the header.  What does Photosphere need in the
EXIF header for best accuracy?

(Make and model)
Shutter speed
F stop
ISO 

Anything else?

If your proportions are wrong in the result, adding information to the Exif header won't fix the problem.  In general, Photosphere requires:

ASA
Speed
Aperture
Make
Model
Version

You need to make sure the white balance and sensitivity are fixed for all exposures, and that the camera is not messing around with the tone curve as many like to do these days.
