Subject: [HDRI] Porting Photosphere to Windows & Linux
Message-ID: <C729B103-5C44-402A-BDB6-37A59E6F4440@gmail.com>

Dear HDRI List,

I hired a programmer friend, Helena Eydelberg-Vileshin, to port Photosphere to wxWidgets under Windows with the intent of offering a cross-platform version.  She has nearly completed her arduous task, with just a few bugs to fix and missing features to add.  At that point, probably in the next couple of weeks, I will take her code and port it to the other platforms.

I know how to do this on the Mac, although wxWidgets is in flux due to Apple's abandonment of the Carbon library, but I don't know what to do for Linux.  I was thinking I could install a "virtual appliance" for one of the available Linux systems under VMWare Fusion:

	http://www.vmware.com/appliances/directory/cat/5793?k=&sort=created

This should permit me to do the development work on my Mac, avoiding the need for another computer or dual-boot system, but I'm open to alternative suggestions.  If I did get one of these VA's, which one would be most useful to the community?  Would I have to distribute Photosphere in source form with a build system to reach a reasonable number of Linux users?  I ask because I still have some hopes of recovering some of my development and documentation costs for Photosphere, which has been in the works for nearly a decade.  (For those of you who don't know, I have been distributing the Mac version for free from www.anyhere.com, but since it is also based on Carbon, I can't go any further with it.)

Please vote for your favorite version of Linux, clue me in to how I could create one binary that would run on multiple Linux systems, and share your wxWidgets experience if you have any.

Best,
-Greg

Hi Greg.

I don't have much experience with Linux in a VM (only using Windows) but I
expect that both provide similar features.

shouldn't matter because you will have to satisfy a large variety of

I assume you can "export" a directory to the guest OS in a Linux VM as you
can on Windows. This allows you to edit your files on the Mac and only go to
Linux when you have to compile. I have a similar setup with Mac/Windows but
it's mostly because a VM on my laptop is noticeably slow and it's not nice
to work in it. Of course you can also use scp,rsync or a source control
system to sync between two directories.


> If I did get one of these VA's, which one would be most useful to the

If you want to provide an easy to install binary packages for your app you
will have to install both VMs because they represent different package
managers (RPM based vs. DEB based). I think there is a tool to convert an
*.rpm to a *.deb package but I'm not sure about that. Bernd can give you all
the information you need on *.deb.

If you expect your users to be fairly familiar with their system you can
also just provide *.tgz archives. Matured Linux users will know what to do
with it.

These days I expect that most Linux users rely on their package manager to
get software installed. If you want to get included in major distributions
like Debian you will have to provide source code, too. However, I don't
think it's a problem for anyone to download a *.deb or *.rpm file and
double-click to install.

I am a bit out of touch with Linux libraries these days but I remember that
is used to be hell to get the right version for a particular software.
Further GTK (which is used by wxWindows on Linux) is about to release a new
major version which might mess up the GTK based desktops for a while.

I think if you build static binaries you shouldn't be too bothered by all of
this. But then I don't really understand all the details.

Thomas

Hi Greg,

I can build you an Ubuntu 10.10 or newer vm for vmware if you would like.

Just because it is Linux does not mean that you have to distribute in 
source form. I have never really spent time figuring out how the 
packaging systems work for building and distributing. There must be some 
tools for this though.

Best,

-Jack

Hi guys,
do you plan to support the LTS of Ubuntu I think that would be usefull for
your tool too, 'cause not everybody is using the newest OSes...
I think it shouldn't be a problem unless you use very new libraries

Thanks Jack, Thomas:

I'm likely to delay the porting of Photosphere to Linux after I get the Mac version working in wxWidgets.  Especially given my lack of Linux experience, and that I'm doing this on the side of my two paid positions, I don't want to get overwhelmed into sloppiness.

Lars also had a good (off-list) suggestion to distribute the GUI code in source form and the rest as linked libraries, which could probably be made to work across all Linux installations more easily.  That may be the way to go; I'm not sure.  The easiest for me of course would be to find someone else to do the work who knows what they're doing, but I've already enlisted and imposed upon two of my friends to help me out.  I've compensated them somewhat for their time from my own pocket, but I'm hoping to capitalize on their efforts and get a little revenue stream going in addition.  We'll see...

Hi Greg and all!

Great news that Photosphere can make a jump into Linux!

Lars' suggestion is great, but there are also some possibilities 
to make a cross-distro binary package:
http://listaller.nlinux.org/ or https://launchpad.net/listaller
http://zero-install.sourceforge.net/

Otherwise we can try it the Blender way:
decide on a target amount of money you want to reach to free the source code
and wait for enough people to pay and exceed the target, then free the code ...
I think it's an interesting business model ... and the HDRI community is rather large ...

Other than this, I'm happy to help in my spare time, I've done a bit of wxwidgets 
programming and packaging for linux and windoze.

Ciao ciao,

Francesco

Hi Francesco,

Thanks for the links and your helpful offer.  Much as I like open source in general, in order for the model to work it needs either (a) the original programmer to remain closely involved, or (b) a generic enough utility that a group of talented programmers will take it over.  Radiance definitely falls into the (a) category, and I suspect Photosphere is similar.  I probably will free the code at some point, but if I target compensation for the time and money I've sunk into it, we'll never get there.  No, I fully expect my eventual decision to be an arbitrary one.

Meanwhile, if you help me port it to Linux, I'll be happy to funnel a good chunk of the proceeds your way.  Support requirements mandate that in any case.

Cheers,
-Greg

Wonderful.  I'll let you know once I get going with the Mac port-back and have things organized enough to pass along.

Cheers,
