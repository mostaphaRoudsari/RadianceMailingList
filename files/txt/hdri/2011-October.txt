Subject: [HDRI] HDRcapOSX October 2011 update Mac OS 10.6/10.7 and Canon EOS
	SDKs 2.9/2.10
Message-ID: <ABFCB5AA-F1CA-4398-8D94-EC7942C35E3E@dmu.ac.uk>

HDRcapOSX now works with OS X 10.6/10.7 and Canon EOS SDKs 2.9/2.10.

Denis Fan has (once again) updated HDRcapOSX. The update was compiled under 10.6.8 but seems to work under 10.7.2.  

Two versions are in the package: 

(a) Version 2.0
This version has been updated and supported under Canon EOS SDK version 2.9. The package has been compiled under Mac OS X version 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard) as an universal binary, BACKWARDS compatible up to Mac OS X version 10.4.x (Tiger). Compatible to latest camera model up to EOS 60D, NOT EOS 600D and EOS 1100D.

(b) Version 2.1
This version has been updated and supported under Canon EOS SDK version 2.10. The package has been compiled under Mac OS X version 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard) as an universal binary, BACKWARDS compatible up to Mac OS X version 10.5.x (Leopard). Compatible to latest camera model up to EOS 600D and EOS 1100D.

Testing has been limited so please report successes and failures to Denis Fan and John Mardaljevic - include camera model number in any reports.  HDRcapOSX Version 2.1 was (briefly) tested under 10.7.2 with a Canon EOS 400D and seemed to work fine.

Thank you, that's excellent. 

By pure coincidence I was just running a blog article on tethered HDR shooting. Updated it with a link to HDRcapOSX.

Thanks again for keeping this project alive.

Subject: [HDRI] response curve data from Photosphere
Message-ID: <CAJYAbgroxyS8z02UFqFY+888tKE-vN3n-zTt=Tk=me8hStN2fA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everybody!

I'm a Fulbright student working on my second Master's in AE Lighting at UNL,
Omaha. My current research is on High Dynamic Range Imaging in Lighting.
Does anybody know how to get the information on the response curve from
Photosphere similar to the one that WebHDR would give you?

Thank you,
Yulia

Hi Yulia,

The camera response functions are stored in the text file $HOME/Library/Preferences/Photosphere

Towards the end, you will see a list of camera responses that have been stored by make, model, and version.  Each line looks something like this:

"NIKON CORPORATION"|"NIKON D200"|"Ver.2.01"|{-4.765716e-04,1.355876e-01,-1.269868e-01,9.918758e-01}|{-6.390453e-04,1.371893e-01,-1.224765e-01,9.859263e-01}|{-9.074065e-04,1.351222e-01,-1.165654e-01,9.823506e-01}

The coefficients enclosed in curly braces are the polynomial camera responses, one per color in red, green, and blue order.  The coefficient order is from low to high power, so the above line translates to:

red(r) = -4.765716e-04 + 1.355876e-01*r + -1.269868e-01*r^2 + 9.918758e-01*r^3;

green(g) = -6.390453e-04 + 1.371893e-01*g + -1.224765e-01*g^2 + 9.859263e-01*g^3;

blue(b) = -9.074065e-04 + 1.351222e-01*b + -1.165654e-01*b^2 + 9.823506e-01*b^3

The input (r,g,b) values are camera sensor values normalized in a 0-1 range.  The output values are related to world luminance units, sometimes with a calibration scaling factor built in.

I hope this is helpful.

-Greg
