Subject: [HDRI] Photosphere "Cannot solve for response function"
Message-ID: <BLU165-ds7BA7A689FA9FFC6D79883E9BE0@phx.gbl>

Dear all,

I am trying to create HDRIs using an Android Smartphone. I have taken six photos ranging from ?3 to +3 and have tried to fuse these in Photosphere, however I am getting a ?cannot solve for response function? message. Does anyone know how I can create a response curve or what I am missing to create the response curve? I can create a HDR image using the generic response curve, but for my thesis I would need all the HDRIs to be as accurate as possible. 

Thank you for your time.

Kind regards,
Peony

Hi Peony,

The likely problem is that your smart phone is too smart!  Most phone cameras play tricks with the response curve, white balance, and other capture characteristics that undermine any attempt to get a consistent HDR result.  No phone cameras I know allow you a true "manual mode" that disables such behavior, so they aren't really suited to HDR capture.

Best,
-Greg

Hi Greg & Rob,

Thank you for your quick responses. I've taken the photos on a tripod under 
an artificial sky to minimise errors, but from what you are saying there's 
nothing I can do to create a camera response curve.

Thank you for all your help.

Kind regards,
Peony

Peony,

It is also possible that you could not create the camera response curve based on the scene you have taken. If the scene  does not have large and smooth gradients, Photosphere cannot create a camera response curve. This could happen with any camera. A different scene that has the gradients would provide a camera response curve. However, the issues Greg pointed out are major problems with phone cameras. Even if you are able to generate the camera response curve with another scene, due to the inconsistencies Greg pointed out, it is unlikely to get accurate, reliable HDR images.

Hi Peony,

if you upload your sequence to
http://www.jaloxa.eu/webhdr/roll-your-own.shtml
I'll have a look over the weekend. However, as Greg pointed out--don't 
hold your breath. You might have to use a proper camera if you're 
interested in HDRs that are 'as accurate as possible'. What are you 
trying to measure?

Cheers

Axel

Hi Chris,

I think you are asking me, as I'm the only one with access to the full source code outside of Dolby...  And no, I haven't compiled it under Ubuntu.  I haven't compiled under any recent version of Linux in fact.  I don't know how cross-compatible binaries are.  It's a pain due to all the external library dependencies (OpenEXR and TIFF mostly), but I could try recompiling it on the Lubuntu image I have under VMWare.  Can anyone tell me how likely that is to work as an executable?

-Greg

I've been able to compile (or at least run it) using Ubuntu. I believe
the troubles I had earlier were related to a 64bit Ubuntu distro.

Don't know if that's your issue, but I think I ran into that before and
couldn't figure out the specific dependency that was missing (an older
version than what I had available).

Hey Greg,

For whatever it is worth I have had no problems compiling the latest 
Radiance on the latest Ubuntu (after adding a few extra packages).

I was able to roll a fresh ubuntu using vmware player in a very short 
amount of time. Not sure of the status of hdrgen at this point, I hope 
this helps.

Chaps,

I've recently had the pleasure of rebuilding my 64bit Fedora system from 
scratch due to a failing hard disk. Got hdrgen working, too.

hdrgen is a 32bit application, so simply doing a
# apt-get install libtiff
on a 64 bit Debian-based system will only pull the 64bit Tiff library. 
So make sure you have all the 32bit deps on your 64bit system. The two 
co-exist quite happily.

The only bit of 'hacking' I had to do was to soft-link libtiff.so.4 
(what comes with Fedora) to libtiff.so.3 (which is what hdrgen is linked 
against).

Chris, if you can expand on 'no joy', I might be able to give you a few 
pointers.

Cheers

Axel

It's a pain due to all the external library dependencies (OpenEXR and TIFF mostly), but I could try recompiling it on the Lubuntu image I have under VMWare.

I managed to compile hdrgen under Lubuntu using VMWare, so if anyone else wants a copy, let me know.  I'll send one to Axel since it's a little more recent version of the code (I think).

Hi Axel,

Thank you for that. Have uploaded a sequence onto your website.
I'm trying to determine if a Smartphone is able to capture a HDR scene as a 
daylight analysis tool.

Thank you for all your time.

Kind regards,
Peony

Hi Peony,

if you upload your sequence to
http://www.jaloxa.eu/webhdr/roll-your-own.shtml
I'll have a look over the weekend. However, as Greg pointed out--don't
hold your breath. You might have to use a proper camera if you're
interested in HDRs that are 'as accurate as possible'. What are you
trying to measure?

Cheers

Axel

Hi Peony,

The four images that you uploaded have the following exposure values:

0.jpg ISO68  F2.8 0.0666667s 6.32EV
1.jpg ISO199 F2.8 0.0666667s 7.87EV
2.jpg ISO200 F2.8 0.125s     6.97EV
3.jpg ISO200 F2.8 0.125s     6.97EV

You need a wider range of exposures to cover the dynamic range of the 
scene. Visually, the images appear to have almost the same brightness. 
They need to noticeable different. See
http://www.jaloxa.eu/webhdr/demo.shtml
for an example exposure-bracketed sequence.

It is recommended to vary only the exposure time, although in principle, 
playing with the ISO sensitivity should work, too. Just make sure the 
aperture is fixed, which it is in your example shots.

The last two images (I don't have your original file names) have exactly 
the same exposure. Visually, however, one is a little darker than the 
other. This can mean that the EXIF information (aperture, ISO, shutter) 
is unreliable.

You must also mount your camera/smart phone on a tripod. hdrgen can do 
some magic trying to align the frames, but it's better to not rely on 
it. For accurate results, a tripod is a must.

You will also need to get hold of a luminance meter against which you 
need to calibrate the HDRs. Note that the calibration factor depends on 
the white balance setting with which the images were taken.

I don't know how you can control the exposure times on a smartphone, but 
my recommendation would be that you borrow a decent camera and get some 
experience with HDR photography before attempting to do this on a smart 
phone. Alternatively, invest in a second hand Canon PowerShot and put 
CHDK on it: http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/CHDK. Make sure your model is 
supported. This will allow you to take exposure-bracketed sequences 
without touching the camera. For most PowerShots, it will also give you 
the option of saving in RAW format for when you need the results to be 
VERY accurate.

Hope this gets you started. Good luck

Axel

Dear all,

After a discussion with my supervisor, there are a few things I would like 
to clarify and hopefully get some help on.

Through the built-in app on my Smartphone, I can get seven photographs 
ranging from EV - 3 to + 3 and I can manually adjust the white balance in 
the photographs.

I have also captured 3 photographs using a app called HDR camera, but for 
some reason it was producing 4 photographs on my phone hence the photographs 
providing the same EV when I uploaded to Axel's website, so I apologise for 
that. I have emailed the developers and am waiting for an reply for them 
regarding this.

I've been capturing the images in an artificial sky in a lighting laboratory 
available at the university and have used a luminance meter to calibrate the 
images.

And my goal for this thesis is to develop a programmable data acquisition 
system that is not expensive like a DSLR camera with a fisheye lens, but 
instead a less expensive method using an Android Smartphone plus a US$50 
fisheye lens.

However, though all the process described above, a camera response curve 
cannot be create and the error message (Cannot solve for response function) 
appears.
Is there anything else, apart from switching to a DSLR camera, I can do to 
create a camera response curve?


Thank you for your time.

Kind regards,
Peony

I guess there is something in between mobile phones and DSLR. There are
compact cameras around, some of which can be remote controlled.

Cheers, Lars.
