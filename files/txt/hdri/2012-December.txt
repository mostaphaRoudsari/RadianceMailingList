Subject: [HDRI] Update on (not of) HDRcapOSX
Message-ID: <AE2C06A5D4A79244AA0AB930A5BFD04B14788D82@ITSMBX-3.lunet.lboro.ac.uk>

The 'current' version of HDRcapOSX (v2.1, October 2011) works with OS X 10.8.2 - based on a single test with a Canon EOS 400D, a 550D and a 600D.  I couldn't get a 300D to work, but could find no good reason why (updated the firmware to 1.1.1 but that didn't fix it).

There are no plans at present to update HDRcapOSX, and the download site is now:

Canon DSLR models after late 2011 *may* not work.  Suggest you get a (confirmed) working HDRcapOSX install on your laptop and try out the models in-store if unsure.

I'll update the list of Canon DSLRs that work with HDRcapOSX with any confirmations that people care to send.

Best
John

Hi Peony,

I guess no one ever responded to this...  I can really only repeat my response from August, which is that getting calibrated output from phone cameras is not possible at this stage, and may never be.  Their application is too different, and repeatability is not one of the design requirements for these modules.  They alter sensitivity, color response, and probably tone response without making any record of the original data.  I really think it is a waste of your time.

Best,
-Greg

> Therefore, after experimenting in the lighting laboratory, I got my Smartphone camera back out and using a HDR Camera application available in the Android market. I put both cameras side by side and took images of the same scene on a tripod. However, I am still receiving the same error message as before, then I found out that the HDR Camera application does not write the EXIF data required to create a camera response curve. Therefore, just to try the images produced by the Smartphone out, I coped the EXIF data from the DSLR camera and inserted into the images produced by the Smartphone camera ensuring that all the exposure value information are the same. I then try and fuse these Smartphone camera produced images together, but the same error message reappears.
