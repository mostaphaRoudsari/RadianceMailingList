Subject: [HDRI] RGB in Photosphere & sequence of exposures
Message-ID: <CB3D00BF.13EA3%kevinv@uidaho.edu>

HDRI mailing list,

1) I am using Photosphere to examine ?RGB? values of single exposures using
the Histogram function (RGB) to determine which exposures to include or
exclude in ?Make HDR?.  Is this histogram RGB applying the weighting factor
( R*0.2651 + G* 0.6701 + B*0.0648) to determine the Minimum and Maximum
values reported?

2) Does Photosphere expect the multiple exposures to be loaded sequentially
from the brightest (longest shutter speed) to the darkest (shortest shutter
speed) or vice versa?  Will the accuracy be compromised in any manner
depending on the order in which the exposures are loaded?

Thank you,

Hi Kevin,

1) The weighting factors are not applied to the individual channels.  What you see is a raw histogram of the data values.

2) Photosphere re-orders the images according to their exposure.  It makes no difference the order in which they are given to the software.

There is a check box you can use to automatically exclude unneeded exposures, but it sometimes throws out a few of the brightest pixel values.  If you want to be sure you lose nothing, just give Photosphere all of your exposures and it will use what it can.

Cheers,
-Greg

Subject: [HDRI] pvalue -o
Message-ID: <CB4CEF9B.14464%kevinv@uidaho.edu>

HDRI list - 

Can someone help me better understand the pvalue ?o option?

http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/man_html/pvalue.1.html

I have completed HDRgen for a large data set, and will apply exposure
correction, vignetting correction, then use pvalue (with or without ?o) to
apply the spot calibration using a grey card mask (according to below), and
finally pvalue again (with or without ?o) to get useful results.

This is in the context of the previous post for automating the spot
calibration for a large number of HDRs using luminance meter and grey card
in a scene. 

Do I let it at the default (+o)?

Thank you,

Hi Kevin,

from my understanding, the exposure correction here is done by modifying
the exposure, not the image data itself. pvalue -o would give you the
raw pixel data, ignoring the exposure (and thus the correction you did).
So I would not use the -o switch here, because you want the exposure
correction (which you caluclated from your known luminance values) to be
applied.

Three ways to handle uncertainty in my mail (in ascending order of wisdom):

1) Believe in my mail.[1]

2) Hope that Greg confirms (or rejects) these assumptions.[2]

3) Try out by e.g. using a 10 times higher value for the exposure
correction then you get from your calibration. That should lead to 10
times higher values in the results, if the correction got applied,
right? So if you get these 10 times higher values even with pvalue -o,
my assumption was wrong.

;)

Cheers, Lars.

[1] strongly discouraged approach
[2] promising to be on the safe side

Kevin,

you need to set pvalue -o to get the pixel values from the calibrated 
HDR image. The pixel luminance is then the weighted average of the RGB 
channels.

You may use hdrexpo.pl to do the calibration:
http://www.jaloxa.eu/resources/hdr/hdrexpo/index.shtml
-- simply supply the calibration factor (spot meter reading/HDR value)

Cheers

Axel

CORRECTION:

the -o switch was correct, but to get the luminance, you need to 
multiply the weighted RGB by 179. Better use -b to get the 'brightness' 
or luminance, which is weighted RGB * 179.
