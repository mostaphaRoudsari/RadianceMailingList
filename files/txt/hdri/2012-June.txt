Message-ID: <22F15CDC-F2E6-44B9-AE92-E49F9075DBC6@gmx.net>

Hi,

I am wondering what devices people are currently using to display HDR imaging data. Some may have seen the light box developed to display the Radiance renderings of Hagia Sophia (presented on the Radiance workshops). That is a rather static approach fitting to exactly one image, made for exhibitions, but less useful for displaying changing content. I am aware of techniques based on custom-made projector setups and some few commercial products. Still I wonder whether anyone here actually has experience with a commercial product or did some custom setup which does not require rocket-science skills or gigantic bank account?

Some displays I found:

Dolby reference display, mostly for color, no info on dynamic range, based on brightside displays:
http://www.dolby.com/us/en/professional/hardware/video-monitors/prm-4200-professional-reference-monitor.html

I heard rumors that these achieve up to 1:200,000 contrast?

Cheers, Lars.

Hi Lars,

Since I work for Dolby and helped develop the BrightSide display, I suppose I should offer something here.  The Dolby professional reference monitor offers sequential contrast that is at least 200,000:1, but simultaneous contrast is less than this.  As you say, this display is more targeted at markets more concerned with accurate color reproduction and wide gamut, such as the film post-production industry.

I don't know if they sell it anymore, but Sim2 also had a display based on BrightSide's technology:

	http://www.engadget.com/2009/02/03/sim2-solar-series-infinite-contrast-hdr-lcd-ships-in-q2/

I believe Toshiba and Samsung also used the technology (though illegally) in their locally dimmed LED+LCD displays.  I don't know which models or how capable the inputs are.

Unfortunately, it's a bit of a waiting game right now for this technology to reach the consumer market.  We have some things in the works, as do others, but I couldn't tell you any details even if I had them.

Various researchers have built their own systems by combining a DLP projector with an LCD display with it's backlight "hinged" out of the way, a la the original paper by Seetzen et al:

Seetzen, Helge, W. Heidrich, W. Stuezlinger, G. Ward, L. Whitehead, M. Trentacoste, A. Ghosh, A. Vorozcovs, "High Dynamic Range Display Systems," ACM Trans. Graph. (special issue SIGGRAPH 2004), August 2004.

For my own use, I still have the HDR viewer I made over a decade ago:

Ward, Greg, "A Wide Field, High Dynamic Range, Stereographic Viewer," Proceedings of PICS 2002, April 2002.

By far the easiest (and cheapest) solution for still images is to print out a grayscale version of the square root of your image (with maximum normalized to 1.0) as described in the above paper, but as a large-format print.  I would make this one the image with exaggerated contrast, since you can print it at high-resolution.  Then, project the original image divided by this grayscale image using a standard DLP or LCD projector -- preferably a bright one although it doesn't need to be high-resolution, onto this print.  Line it up, and viol?!  You have a high-resolution, high dynamic range still image.  There's no way to make it move, sadly.

-Greg

I think sim2 is still a valuable option:

Subject: [HDRI] hdrscope: per-pixel lighting analysis tool
Message-ID: <4FD67A08.8010303@u.washington.edu>


Colleagues,

We would like to announce the release of a new tool for image- based 
light analysis. Hdrscope is a Windows based, user friendly tool that can 
process and analyze High Dynamic Range (HDR) photographs and rendered 
images from Radiance Lighting Simulation and Visualization software. The 
analysis techniques focus on per-pixel luminance analyses. It is free 
and can be downloaded from: http://courses.washington.edu/hdrscope/

Hdrscope features a combination of existing and novel tools and image 
processing techniques. The fundamental algorithms and programs running 
behind the scenes within hdrscope are derived from Radiance software, 
and new features are added. One of the most exciting capabilities is the 
ability to isolate and analyze a region or two regions of interest from 
an image; the regions can be defined using a rectangle, circle or a 
closed polygon interactively. Luminance values, ratios, descriptive 
statistical calculations, percentile ratios, criterion rating, and 
luminance contrast are reported. The software also provides a front end 
to Evalglare. It allows for calibration using luminance measurements, or 
illuminance measurements taken at the camera level for fisheye images. 
It provides an automated image capture tool for selected Canon cameras 
to take multiple exposure photographs. ?Single aperture / multiple 
shutter speed? option is used for general image capture; and ?two 
apertures / multiple shutter speed? option is provided to capture the 
sun and the sky. Photosphere (of course) is recommended for image assembly.

The work behind the software formed the basis of my student?s 
(Viswanathan Kumaragurubaran) Master of Science thesis in Architecture 
at the University of Washington (Seattle). If you have any questions, 
feedback, or comments, please let us know (hdrscope at uw.edu)

Regards,

Mehlika Inanici
