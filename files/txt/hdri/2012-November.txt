Hi everyone,

After much development on my thesis, I have a few queries I am hoping some 
of you will be able to help me out on.

First of, my supervisor pointed out an application on the iPhone called 
iPhotoLux which maps the luminance measurement of an HDR image taken by the 
iPhone camera. So I am hoping what I am trying to produce in my thesis does 
work.

Secondly, I have been using a Nikon DSLR camera to create HDR images in the 
lighting laboratory using a scale model, so that my skills in creating a 
accurate HDR image. I have also used both luminance and illuminance meters 
to ensure the photos are accurate.

Therefore, after experimenting in the lighting laboratory, I got my 
Smartphone camera back out and using a HDR Camera application available in 
the Android market. I put both cameras side by side and took images of the 
same scene on a tripod. However, I am still receiving the same error message 
as before, then I found out that the HDR Camera application does not write 
the EXIF data required to create a camera response curve. Therefore, just to 
try the images produced by the Smartphone out, I coped the EXIF data from 
the DSLR camera and inserted into the images produced by the Smartphone 
camera ensuring that all the exposure value information are the same. I then 
try and fuse these Smartphone camera produced images together, but the same 
error message reappears.

Therefore, I was just wondering if anyone knows why the camera response 
curve cannot be created even with the comparison done between the DSLR 
camera and the Smartphone camera.

Thank you for all your help.

Kind regards,
Peony

Hi Peony!

I guess there is something in between mobile phones and DSLR. There are
compact cameras around, some of which can be remote controlled.

Cheers, Lars.
