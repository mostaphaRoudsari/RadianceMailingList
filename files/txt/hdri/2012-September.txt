Dear list,

Some of you might have looked at my 'Glare Measurements Using HDR 
Photography' presentation that I gave at the recent workshop in Copenhagen.

On page 22 of that presentation, the WebHDRtools are mentioned as 'soon 
to be released'. Well, 'soon' is now:

http://www.jaloxa.eu/resources/hdr/webhdrtools/index.shtml

As per normal, it's work in progress, but I still hope that you find 
them useful.

When I embarked on my little glare measurement project, I thought that 
the accurate calibration/characterisation of consumer digital cameras 
for reliable luminance measurements (including glare) is relatively 
easily done, given a good calibration factor here, and a good dose of 
vignetting calibration there -- all wrapped up by Radiance's native 
tools such as findglare and glarendx. It turned out that this is not the 
case. So if anyone is interested in pushing this further, please do get 
in touch through this mailing list. There are many un-answered questions...

Cheers

Axel

Subject: [HDRI] Vignetting correction on a fish-eye HDR image
Message-ID: <CAN1QwsPUWTGjbAGbLQBvZkOSXjKkn+4YXibs0z_Z6J44Tr8W=Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am trying to fix vignetting on fish-eye HDR images. I found this post in
HDRI archive:

http://www.radiance-online.org/pipermail/radiance-general/2010-April/006711.html

I am still confused on how to use pcomb to fix vignetting.
Can anyone help me wright the pcomb script using the following polynomial
function:

y = -1.28E -12 * x 4 + 3.43E - 09 * x3 - 3.38E - 06 * x2 +1.45E - 03 * x +
7.70E - 01

Thank you,

Hi Leyla,

Assuming this function describes the fall-off as a function of eccentricity (distance from image center), and the edge of the image is the edge of your circle corresponding to x==1 in your formula, you could try:

	pcomb -e 'sq(x):x*x;r=sqrt(sq(2/xres*x-1)+sq(2/yres*y-1))' \
		-e 'sf=-1.28E-12*r^4 + 3.43E-09*r^3 - 3.38E-06*r^2 +1.45E-03*r + 7.70E-01'  \
		-e 'ro=sf*ri(1);go=sf*gi(1);bo=sf*bi(1)' input.hdr > corrected.hdr

I think I must be misunderstanding your function, though, because it plots as a (nearly) straight line that increases from 0.7700 at x==0 to 0.7714 at x==1.  This doesn't seem a likely vignetting correction, as it should go down rather than up, and by a more significant amount.

Best,
-Greg
