Subject: [HDRI] About the error message of HDRcapOSX
Message-ID: <6325232B-2C97-49C3-8FD8-F3B71F3DEB35@gmail.com>

Howdy!

I am Jonghoon Kim, Ph.D. student at Texas A&M University. Recently, our daylight research lab bought Apple Mac Mini and Canon 60D DSLR cameras with fisheye lenses. HDRcapOSX will be the software to control the DSRL camera and capture HDRI. However, we are stuck on the error message of HDRcapOSX. (Error!! Cannot open control file. ) Do you know how can we solve this error message?

The OSX version of our Mac Mini is Mountain Lion and we tried latest version (October, 2011)of HDRcapOSX (2.0 and 2.1). Canon EOS utility was installed in Mac Mini and there was no trouble to download images from the camera via a usb cable in the EOS utility. The mode dial of the camera was manual. Please, let me know if you want to know more test environments to solve this issue.

Best regards,
Jonghoon Kim

Hi Tanvir,

There was an excellent talk related to this at the recent Radiance workshop, given by Kevin Van Den Wymelenberg.  The PDF of his slides (large) is at:

	http://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2013-golden-co/VanDenWymelenberg-LuminanceMetrics.pdf

The parent webpage has links to the actual presentation videos:

	http://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2013-golden-co

The talk was in the first afternoon session:

	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmACL4gejp0&list=PLPk2tlcZM0gydvEW0VFgZLZ3S8eSbi-cx&index=2

Kevin starts talking around the 47 minute mark.

I recommend you also check out the research of Dr. Mehlika Inanici at U. Washington:

	http://faculty.washington.edu/inanici/MI-RESEARCH.html

I am cross-posting this to the HDRI mailing list, where you might prefer to follow up.  (You should subscribe first if you aren't on that list already.)

Cheers,
-Greg
