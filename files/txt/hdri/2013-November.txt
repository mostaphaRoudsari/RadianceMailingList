Subject: [HDRI] What is done with pixel R,G and B values?
Message-ID: <CACH8DKcVkB0WLLW=SXdm1OvW0kz=HYPr2buEmZe3dEzwdn-Yyg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
In order to get the luminance value for each pixel what is the calculation
done (process behind this) after getting pixel R, G and B values.

Thankyou
Nithya

Hi,
I had downloaded the radiance 4.2 windows version 32bit application file.
When i tried to install, it is showing an error.I tried downloading it two
times, but still at the time of instalation it is showing the same error.
What shall i do?

Where are you downloading the file from? What version of Windows are you on?

Assuming you have a radiance image (not irradiance), the luminance can be derived like so:

Luminance = (R*0.265+G*0.670+B*0.065)*179

Hello,
I have a series of ldr images from which an hdr image is formed.How is
vertical illuminance (for glare analysis)calculated from fish-eye
image.Please explain the details.

Assuming you mean vertical illuminance at the camera sensor plane, and further assuming the fisheye image captured a reasonable amount of the scene's dynamic range and is a true hemispherical image, then one can simply integrate the cosine-weighted incoming flux to derive illuminance. Evalglare does this for you as part of its own internal calculations for DGP.

Hi,
What is the idea behind evalglare or findglare identifying the daylight
glare source dimension eg: in case of windows. Can somebody give
information regarding this.

Hi Nithya,

>From the findglare man page:

Findglare  normally identifies glare sources as directions that are brighter than 7 times the average luminance level.  It
       is possible to override this determination by giving an explicit luminance threshold with the -t option.  It usually works
       best to use the 'l' command within ximage(1) to decide what this value should be.  Alternatively, one can use the 't' com-
       mand within rvu(1).  The idea is to pick a threshold that is well above the average level  but  smaller  than  the  source
       areas.

There are a lot of caveats when using findglare, so be sure to read the whole thing:
http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/man_html/findglare.1.html


Evalglare was the product of Jan Wienold's dissertation, which can be considered the prime source for info on how evalglare does its thing. Here's a good paper on actually using evalglare:
