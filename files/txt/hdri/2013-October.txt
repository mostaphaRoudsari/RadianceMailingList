Subject: [HDRI] Masking perimeter corners of fisheye image with black
Message-ID: <A45B442E-0EF7-44F1-8F8F-1C6572E0413D@christianhumann.com>

Dear list,

I've been using the following pcomb routine to fill in the perimeter corners of a square, 1200x1200 fisheye image with black to cover up the light spill inside the lens body and around the perimeter of the lens element:

pcomb -e 's(x):x*x;m=if(xmax*ymax/4-s(x-xmax/2)-s(y-ymax/2),1,0);ro=m*ri(1);go=m*gi(1);bo=m*bi(1)' input.hdr > output.hdr

In order to maintain the absolute pixel values, which are much lower in the resultant 'output.hdr', would I need to use 'ra_xyze' piped into pcomb?  I've tried various iterations but keep getting "illegal output resolution."  

As always thanks!

Chris

Hi Chris,

Would adding a "-o" option to your pcomb command (original values) solve your problem?

Pfilt is a program coming with Radiance (www.radiance-online.org). It 
allows you to filter images in Radiance RGBE format, an HDR image format 
storing a wide range of radiance (or, sometimes, irradiance) values 
maintaining acceptable file sizes. However, it applies algorithms to the 
file that go beyond scaling the image size. I would thus propose to use 
pcomb instead, again, part of Radiance.

Both tools provide a command-line interface, no graphical user 
interface. The syntax for pcomb to generate a 800 by 800 pixel version 
of big.hdr would be
pcomb -x 800 -y 800 -o big.hdr > small.hdr

The -o will revert any exposure-adjustments that may have been applied 
to your image before. small.hdr would be the image to be processed by 
evalglare.

Evalglare is just one program that should be located in a directory 
included in your operating system's search path. No need for any kind of 
"installer".
> 3. Will evalglare work well with hdr images other than fish-eye?
Yes. However, you need to know the vertical illuminance than, which can 
be calculated from the pixel values in case that you have a 180 degrees 
fisheye.

I guess you are working in some Windows environment. I have no 
experience with this, so my answers are pretty generic. You will need to 
know how to work on the command-line if you want to start using 
evalglare and Radiance HDR tools. This is not specific to HDRI, but to 
knowing your operating system. Many do not find Windows to be a very 
comfortable environment for such applications, I would rather go with a 
Linux or Mac OS installation, however it is not impossible.

Good luck, cheers, Lars.

I hadn't noticed before that this question is posted to the HDRI list, which may have a limited number of readers who are also using evalglare on Windows. It might be worthwhile to post your questions #1 and #2 to the radiance-general mailing list in this case. Those questions have more to do with successful use of evalglare and Radiance in Windows than they are specific to HDRI. To add to Lars' answer for question #3, please check this link:

Subject: [HDRI] Tone mapping for animation
Message-ID: <CAL-bo5EWL=NjbOrBTQcxpF-Q=FSqU=C_fjSL+Cx-gYWtfAqjOQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have a question concerning the tone mapping procedures implemented in the
Radiance tools.
For an animation of a full day I would like to get something similar that a
camera would do that just takes a picture every 5 minutes with the same
settings (exposure time and aperture). Rendering the images for every 5
minutes is not a problem, however, I stuck when trying to convert the HDRs
to some tonemapped images. As far as I got it, In ra_jpeg/hdr2jpeg no
exposure can be given at all, in ra_tiff/ra_bmp only relative exposures can
be applied.

Thus my question: is it possible to explicitly set the exposure used in the
tonemapping process with any tool in Radiance?

Thanks in advance!
David

Hi David,

I'd say combine pfilt with ra_tiff, so that you set a fixed exposure 
with pfilt -e X and keep that untouched in the later conversion using 
ra_tiff -e 0. Would that work as expected?

Cheers, Lars.

Hi Jack, hi Lars,

thanks a lot for the quick response!
Jack, your second hint exactly did what I was looking for. I tried to use
pcond first, but didn't think of the possibility to use a histogram...

Sorry, if my description was somehow cryptic, but you exactly found what I
wanted...

Just for information: the pfilt exposure corrections do not help in my case
because the tone-mapping that is done in the HDR2LDR conversion (with
hdr2jpeg / ra_tiff or similar) does the tone mapping for each single frame
independent from the other images. (But maybe I just got something terribly
wrong here...!?)

Thanks!
David

Subject: [HDRI] Recover HDR from RAW images
Message-ID: <9AE3DAF33501B04BA74EFAE96296631836259B13@CORP3011.CORPORATE.FOSTER.NETWORK>

Dear List,

I was wondering if anybody has some experience in recovering luminance information (an HDR image) from a single RAW file.

I understand RAW files as some sort of MDR (Medium Dynamic Range) images... not as wide as a true HDR but higher than jpgs and the like...
This range could be enough to get some meaningful results in certain lighting conditions (i.e. an artificially lit interior) where contrast is limited.

I have tried a few ways to accomplish this using Photoshop or Picturenaut or LuminaceHDR but I get very different results and a million different options that end up being quite confusing.

Anyone any thoughts?

Thanks in advance,

Giovanni

Hi Giovanni,

Preserving all of the data from a camera RAW file is a tricky business.  The Adobe RAW converter has a lot of options to play with and allows you to go straight into a 16-bit/channel file, which has the potential to keep everything.  You still have to make choices as to how to clamp the highlights as the three channels will clip at different levels and this depends on the camera sensor, environment and white balance settings.

The ultimate control comes from the program dcraw by Dave Coffin:

	http://www.cybercom.net/~dcoffin/dcraw/

I have written the attached C-shell script that uses dcraw and another excellent freeware package called exiftool to preserve 16-bit data and camera information while converting to a linear 16-bit/channel output.  This will be recognized by Photosphere but may display incorrectly in other programs due to an assumed gamma.

Cheers,
-Greg
