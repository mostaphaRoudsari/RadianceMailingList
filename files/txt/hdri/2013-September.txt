Subject: [HDRI] hdr imaging doubts - evalglare
Message-ID: <CACH8DKdGu3ifrNmKZQ4i8AXEt=HrEC8dbibM+8pnKR=OgLrcRg@mail.gmail.com>

Sir,
I had gone through a pdf glare analysis with evalglare, and i hav met with
some problems.
1.As evalglare software requires hdr images of 800x800 pixels, i tried to
get the pixel information using getinfo in DOS window from the START
button-> run->cmd. And while using pfilt command to divide x and y by a
number, it says pfilt is not recoznised as an internal or external command.
Is there another command to resize the image that can be used with DOS
window?
2. How shall i install the evalglare application? When i run evalglare
application by right clicking the setup file,a plain dos screen appears.How
shall i start with it?
3. Will evalglare work well with hdr images other than fish-eye?
Please help me to solve these issues.
Thankyou
