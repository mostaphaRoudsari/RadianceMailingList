Subject: [HDRI] Vignetting Correction Using a ULS
Message-ID: <CAH3D6q+vTW0Y_BJVxLuFiH4bRTyTXYy-Tped97fHJPNKM21MCw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear List,

I am looking to find a method for correcting vignetting occurring in HDR
images using radiance as part of an undergraduate research study. I am
using a Uniform Luminance Sphere to create a uniformly lit background in
order to create a reference image.

I have used radiance to create the HDR images, and I am wondering if there
is a way to take the HDR image and divide each pixel intensity by that of
its optical center. This would create an image/mask of fractional pixel
values that can be divided into another image to correct for the cameras
specific vignetting.

Other suggestions would be greatly appreciated as well.

Thanks,
Josh

Dear Joshua,

the command pcomb allow you to do that. However, there are some caveats 
to be aware of:

1) The center of the image in the meaning of x_max / 2, y_max / 2 is not 
(exactly) the centre of the lens. There is no perfectly aligned camera, 
the optical axis will almost never pass the sensor exactly in its 
center. So your "zero" coordinates will be at x_max / 2 + x_off, y_max / 
2 + y_off.

2) Do you have any information how uniform your sphere actually is? 
Relying on the uniformity of the source for such calibrations seams to 
be a bit risky, unless the uncertainties are known.

Neglecting these, with pcomb, you can create an image describing the 
vignetting such that for each pixel you have the ratio of pixel values 
pv_observed / pv_uniform, with this ration being expected as one for the 
centre and decreasing towards the edges. In this example, I avoid all 
calculations regarding the fall-off from an image center, instead this 
would simply divide the uncorrected image pixel-wise by the "reference 
image", with all pixels having the value pv_max. You can get pv_max 
using e.g. rvu, which allows you to select an area and get the average 
of the contained pixel values.

1) create a "reference image" of uniform pixel values pv_max as 
"measured" at the centre of your image, e.g. using rvu (replace <max_x> 
<max_y> by the resolution of your images, and use your readings at the 
image centre instead of 1,1,1 when assigning ro, go and bo):

pcomb -x <max_x> -y <max_y> -e 'ro=1; go=1; bo=1' > reference.hdr

2) create a correction frame, where pixel values are pv_observed / 
pv_max (so ration of observed pixel value when taking a picture of the 
sphere / pixel value measured at centre):

pcomb -e 'ro=ri(1)/ri(2); go=gi(1)/gi(2); bo=bi(1)/bi(2)' -o 
observed.hdr -o reference.hdr > correction.hdr

3) you may delete the reference frame now...

rm reference.hdr

4) apply the correction by dividing each uncorrected image you have by 
the correction frame:

pcomb -e 'ro=ri(1)/ri(2); go=gi(1)/gi(2); bo=bi(1)/bi(2)' -o 
uncorrected.hdr -o correction.hdr > corrected.hdr

It is a bit paranoid but I got used to add the -o to all calls of pcomb 
- just in case I had exposure corrections applied to my images. It has 
been a while that I did such pixel corrections, so I hope I did not do 
anything wrong here, but basically this approach works well if you can 
rely on the readings for the image centre.

Cheers, Lars.

Hi there:
I have a question that concerns HDR photo and Glare analysis.

Can I use Adobe Photoshop CC (which has the Camera Raw plugin) to prepare
my HDR images?
after that calibrate it with the use of HDRSCOPE that is proposed by Mehlika
Inanici. Instead of Photosphere?

Hi Fatemeh,

I do not know wether the dynamic range of the raw images you get from 
your camera matches the requirements of what you intend to do with those 
images. The wide dynamic range in typical daylid scenes led folks here 
to use exposure series. About the software, I have some doubts that 
Adobe will tell you about the internals of their HDR code. So it will be 
difficult to get support or any information about the meaning of pixel 
values in the resulting images. Does Adobe claim the resulting HDR 
images to have physically correct values?

Cheers, Lars.

While you *might* be able to use Adobe's CameraRAW processor to convert the original images to JPEGs, later to be combined using hdrgen or similar, Lars is right that Photoshop itself does not maintain absolute photometric calibration throughout its processing.

Adobe actually hired me to improve their HDR image merge process, so CS3 and later (I think) derive a camera curve and maintain correct relative values in the images, similar to Photosphere, but I never convinced Adobe to include calibration information in their output.  So, you would need to include a gray card or something whose luminance you measured when you captured the image and use this to correct the final output using a scale factor.  (It is usually a good idea to do this, anyway.)  The procedure for doing this can be found on Mehlika Inanici's site, and also in other posts to this mailing list.

Cheers,
-Greg

Thank you guys for your reply:

I think I will go for Greg solution, including a gray card or something 
whose luminance that I captured the image and use this to correct the 
output using a scale factor.
I wish there was a Photosphere for windows also.
cheers

Dear Lars:

Thank you for your proposed alternatives. Webhdr is a great, user 
friendly tool and I was not aware of that.
I have one more question regarding the calibration.

V. Kumaragurubaran and M. Inanici have proposed two methods for 
calibration. one is based on measuring the absolute luminance of the 
graycard and the other one is based one measuring the illuminance at the 
camera level in the scene that they suggest it for special cases such as 
sun and sky capture.

I am doing daylight research in an office area with alternative 
shadings (artificial lighting is off during the study).
Is using the  Illuminance calibration that utilizes captured 
illuminance of the camera level with the handhold illuminance meter 
(proposed in hdrscope) a correct way of calibrating the  HDR photos In 
my case?

Just a request to make reading posts easier -- please do NOT include an entire digest with your post.

Write what you have to say at the beginning, and paste in whatever *relevant* information people might want who haven't been following the recent conversation.  

As a general rule, keep it short and sweet and avoid a lot of redundant information.

Thanks!
-Greg

I have one more question regarding the calibration:

I am doing daylight research in an office area with alternative 
shadings (artificial lighting is off during the study).
Is using the  Illuminance calibration with the help of handhold 
illuminance meter a correct way of calibrating the  HDR photos In my 
case?

V. Kumaragurubaran and M. Inanici have proposed this method for special 
cases such as sun and sky capture.

Thanks Greg. I've tried to make it short.

Hi Fatemeh,

It is possible to calibrate HDR images against the illuminance at the
lens.  I have found, however, that calibrating against the luminance
of an object that's in the image is more reliable.

See page 9 of my presentation from the 2012 Radiance workshop:
http://radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2012-copenhagen

the columns labelled CF_lumi and CF_illu list the calibration factors
for that scene, a photo of which is on the previous page.  You can see
that luminance-based CFs are much more consistent.

The story might change for sky capture, but I am not familiar with the
methodology proposed by Kumaragurubaran and Inanici.

Regards

Axel
