Message-ID: <FE8277D3C8BD7C429D6C8F400871DDD4E217BF07@UWMBX01.uw.lu.se>

Hello,

Does anyone know where I can find the Radiance ximage viewer?

I would like to use the simple "t" command to pick a luminance value in a HDR image.

I used to have it but cannot locate it anymore and do not feel like a full program reinstallation....

Or can you suggest another way (apart from sending my image to pvalue)

Thx

What OS are you on? If Mac or Linux, you could pluck the executable out of one of the packages we have here:

Mac:
https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/download/4.2/radiance-4.2-Darwin.dmg
Linux64:
https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/download/4.2/radiance-4.2-Linux64.tar.gz
Linux32:
https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/download/4.2/radiance-4.2-Linux32.tar.gz

With the mac disk image, if you double-click it to mount it, then right click on the .pkg file and select "show package contents". In the "Contents" folder, you'll see a file called Archive.pax.gz, which is all the executables. Unpack that, and grab image, copy to your Radiance location.

For Windows, I think you'd have to run the installer, but you could always just install it to a secondary location and copy ximage.exe to your usual location, then delete this second install without messing about with paths.
Windows installer:
https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/download/4.2/radiance-4.2-win32.exe

HTH,

All is not lost for Windows users, though. We *did* port rvu to Windows, and you can use that to pick luminance values from pixels, instead.

Thank you for the quick answer Robert.
I am (unfortunately) still working with Windows...I managed to discover rvu.exe on my DIVA\Radiance\bin installation. The simple "t" command works very well when I use a *.pic file as input (a file generated in a Radiance simulation). However, now I am trying to use a *jpg image generated with WebHDR and this does not work.
What should I do? I need to be able to pick pixles in this image to check if my luminance measurements match with parts of the scene.
Please give me some tips....
Thx

Marie-Claude,

the JPG images that WebHDR generates are in a special HDR format that 
Greg developed.  They are essentially 'normal' JPEGs, but with a clever 
HDR header bolted to them.  With almost all image editing software, the 
HDR info is lost or ignored.

You should use the RGBE file (.hdr) the WebHDR also generates.

There is a Windows HDR viewer called HDRView that was developed by Paul 
Debevec.  It is no longer available on his web site, but you can still 
find it through a Google search.  HDRView displays the pixel's RGB under 
the cursor in the status line.  I am not sure if this takes into account 
the exposure value, but do give it a try.  If nothing else, it's a small 
and very fast HDR viewer for Windows.

If you know the pixel coordinates for which you need the luminance, you 
could also extract it with pvalue, although this generates rather large 
text files.  Unfortunately, you don't get the UNIX text processing 
commands on Windows, but some are available as extra downloads.  The 
'grep' command is pretty handy for filtering out exactly what you need.

Best

Axel

Thank you Axel.
I have tried this but from WebHDR, I do not seem to be able to save my picture as RGBE file (.hdr). There is only an option to save it as either *.jpg or *bmp. I clicked on all I could see that resembles what you describe but the only thing it returns is a text file?
Please give me some tips if you have...

Hi Marie-Claude,

You should be able to just download the various different image
formats by right-clicking over the link and selecting 'Save link
as...'

Here's an example of what you get:

- Medium size (800x531)
-- Radiance RGBE (1.23 MB)
-- OpenEXR (1021.62 kB)
-- JPEG-HDR (130.81 kB)
- Large size (1024x680)
-- Radiance RGBE, (1.85 MB)
-- OpenEXR (1.44 MB)
-- JPEG-HDR (137.04 kB)

What you want is the large RGBE image.  This is in Radiance format,
with the extension '.hdr'.  Some older HDR viewers, e.g. the one that
came with Ecotect, insist on the old '.pic' extension.  You can just
rename the file if you're using such software.

Hope this works for you

Regards

Axel

Wonderful! IT WORKS!
Thank you Axel, you saved my day!

Hi Marie-Claude,

You should be able to just download the various different image
formats by right-clicking over the link and selecting 'Save link
as...'

Here's an example of what you get:

- Medium size (800x531)
-- Radiance RGBE (1.23 MB)
-- OpenEXR (1021.62 kB)
-- JPEG-HDR (130.81 kB)
- Large size (1024x680)
-- Radiance RGBE, (1.85 MB)
-- OpenEXR (1.44 MB)
-- JPEG-HDR (137.04 kB)

What you want is the large RGBE image.  This is in Radiance format,
with the extension '.hdr'.  Some older HDR viewers, e.g. the one that
came with Ecotect, insist on the old '.pic' extension.  You can just
rename the file if you're using such software.

Hope this works for you

Regards

Axel
