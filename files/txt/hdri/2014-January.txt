Subject: [HDRI] mksource and IBL
Message-ID: <FF441E4A-D4CD-463E-A291-A2C33977C020@ubiobio.cl>

Hi all,
 
I?m trying to extract a concentrated light source from HDR picture of the sky using mksource.
I run the following script:
oconv materials.mat geometry.rad lightprobe.rad > scene.oct
mksource -d 1000000 -t 2 -a 5 scene.oct > srcs.rad
oconv -i scene.oct srcs.rad ground.rad > finalscene.oct
rpict -vth -vv 180 -vh 180 -vp 1.8 3 1.2 -vd 1 1 0 finalscene.oct > finalsceneview.hdr
ra_tiff finalsceneview.hdr finalsceneview.tif
My results are weird (see https://www.dropbox.com/s/2u4vnsi4ynw0ncz/finalsceneview02.tif)
Do you have any idea what is wrong? a problem with  the capture of the sun? or rather a matter of parameters ?
Is it normal that mksource finds several sources ? (see https://www.dropbox.com/s/n7y97ppm1ip1gky/srcs.rad)
 
Thanks in advance for your help !

Hi Maria,

Thank you for following good list etiquette and posting your image on a website.  You may want to check to be sure that you are subscribed with the HDRI mailing list <http://www.radiance-online.org/community/mailing-lists>, as I had to manually pass your post onto the list.  We don't seem to have you in our system, at least not at this address.

I can't say seeing your light probe which is just shown as white out the window, but mksource will tend to create multiple sources for long, skinny regions.  Reducing the -d setting will reduce the maximum number of sources created in this way.  Your threshold setting also seems to be quite low, and you might consider letting mksource determine this threshold automatically.

The general idea with mksource is to replace only the very brightest regions in a distant environment map with direct sources.  The rest will be handled well enough in the indirect calculation.  Which brings me to my last point -- are you giving mksource the room description as well as the exterior environment?  It completely ignores the local geometry, using only your environment map (light probe) to decide where to place sources.  Perhaps you could post that?

Best,
-Greg

Hi Greg, 

Thanks for your response. 
I've also tried to run the simulation using mksource default parameters, I
obtained this picture but it seems that there is too many sources identified
(see finalsceneview02.tif in
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6ra7xtansk8rdz0/z0aG1qlTHr ). I thought that in
increasing -d, the problem disappears. In this simulation, I gave the room
description but the ground is not specified because I was not sure on how to
describe it in IBL.
In the following simulation I added the ground in describing it using
gensky... I am not sure that it is a good idea (see finalsceneview02.tif in
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/4gu3onc08d933ea/xIwc2E9Kc6 ).

In these two folders you also will find the local geometry, the light probe
image...

Thanks, 
Beatriz

Subject: [HDRI] SMP file busy problem on iterative rendering in Linux
Message-ID: <52EBE7DA.9070703@umn.edu>

Dear Radiance Users,

I've assembled a simple script that iterates through a folder containing 
octrees, and renders using SMP. On Mac, everything works as expected. 
However, on Linux, I get errors suggesting both the syncfile and ppfile 
are still locked by the OS. I've attempted two solutions, including 
adding 'sleep 5' after pfilt (first attempt, shown below), and then by 
externalizing the while loop, with an ending 'exit 0' (second attempt, 
not shown here), but neither approach fixed the problem.

Here is one version of code which works on Mac but not in Linux:

for file in obj/*.oct
do
     filename="${file%.*}"
     rm -f syncfile argsfile ppfile
     echo 1 64 > syncfile
     cat syncfile
     echo -F syncfile @arguments -vf room.vf -o $filename.unf 
$filename.oct > argsfile
     cat argsfile
     NCPU=2
     while [ "$NCPU" -gt 0 ]
     do
         echo "running proc $NCPU"
         rpiece -v -PP ppfile  @argsfile &
         sleep 5
         NCPU=`expr $NCPU - 1`
     done
     wait
     echo "Filtering File - $filename.unf"
     pfilt -1 -e -2 -m .25 -r .6 -x /3 -y /3 $filename.unf > $filename.hdr
     sleep 5
     rm -f syncfile argsfile ppfile
done

Interestingly, I do not get an error saying "cannot remove 'argsfile' ". 
After the first image is successfully rendered, I get the following 
errors at each successive iteration, indicating the rm only works once 
(line 4) in the first iteration:

rm: cannot remove 'syncfile': Text file busy
rm: cannot remove 'ppfile': Text file busy
rm: cannot remove 'syncfile': Text file busy
rm: cannot remove 'ppfile': Text file busy

Since the error isn't fatal, the machine keeps rendering, and ends up 
rendering the same (first) image over and over. Has anyone run into this 
problem and found a solution? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Chris

Hi Chris,

I'm cross-posting answer to Radiance-general where this probably belongs.  You should subscribe there if you aren't already.

Your error message is very strange.  I'd be interested to hear if others have run across this before.  It seems related to attempts to change or remove files that are currently being used as executables.  It doesn't really make sense to me in the context of your script.  This is one of the pages Google pointed me to:

Best,
