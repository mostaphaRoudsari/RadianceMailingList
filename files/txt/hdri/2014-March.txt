Hi,

EVALGLARE, Does it use any sort of climate data for glare analysis.

According to my knowledge, it only analysis from an HDR image.
Can anybody confirm this doubt.

Thnakyou

Correct, evalglare evaluates an HDR image to do the work. You could use climate data and evalglare together, by using Radiance and gendaylit to generate an HDR image of a scene, and evalglare to perform the glare analysis.

Hi Nithya,

evalglare calculates daylight glare probability based on luminance maps. It is up to you how you generate these. If you use simulation tools, they may be based on climate data, depending on how you set up your models. If you use a camera, they will probably be snapshots of the conditions when you took your picture.

Cheers, Lars.

Hi Nithya,

Evalglare processes the image. You may create annual hourly renderings with
climate data, and then use Evalglare to analyze them.
