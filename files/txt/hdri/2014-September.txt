Subject: [HDRI] volunteers needed for an HDR deghosting experiment
Message-ID: <CAMW8KL8Ts5ZK9gg-5fsOgOo3ZMbT-REpyL=dg7341jW=iDh_ww@mail.gmail.com>

Dear HDRI List Members,

As part of a research project that we are engaged in, we are conducting a
user study and we desperately need participants. The task involves
comparing several images which are outputs of HDR deghosting algorithms.

This is a study which everyone can do in front of his or her computer and
lasts for less than 30 minutes (most people finish it in 15-20 mins). The
link to the user study is below:

http://www.ceng.metu.edu.tr/~tarhan/userstudy/

All instructions are explained in that page. My student and I would greatly
appreciate if you can be a participant in this user study. We would be
further delighted if you can forward this link to anybody else who might be
interested.

Thanks very much and all the best,
Ahmet Oguz Akyuz
