Subject: [HDRI] raw2hdr Camera Response Function
Message-ID: <CANZJHYx+MjzPPCMoxXit7_=c+vMNC_XXRD-2GvJsM4LJHzs-2g@mail.gmail.com>

All,

Does anyone know if there is a -r option (to write/use a camera response
function) for raw2hdr like there is for hdrgen?  Using -r with raw2hdr now
gives me an error message that states that -r is not a supported option.

Thank you,

Hi Mio,

from my understanding (important disclaimer...), such an option would 
not be possible or usefult. The response function maps the pixel value 
to a sensor signal (sensor illuminance) by comparing the values of pairs 
of pixel values at different exposure settings. If e.g. the pixel 
coordinate on the CCD x1y1 has leads to a pixel value of 100 at an 
exposure time of 100ms, and of 50 at an exposure time of 50ms, the 
response would be flat. So the idea of reconstructing the response curve 
is based on the assumption that you have several frames of the same 
scene to compare, and that the exposure differs between those frames. 
Even if you got the response time of your camera, it would not be useful 
- as you are assuming to work with raw sensor data. So what is in the 
file should be what the sensor gave as a signal.

Cheers, Lars.

Hi Mio,

The -r option is not needed because the camera response for RAW is predefined.

Lars,

Thank you for the explanation, that makes sense.
