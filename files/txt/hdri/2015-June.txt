?All,

I have recently been using hdrgen and raw2hdr in an effort to make
comparisons between the quality of data between JPEG and RAW image files.
However, I have come across a couple of issues with raw2hdr. The main one
being that we are getting a consistent green tint to the RAW HDR images
created with raw2hdr, which is not shown in its counterpart HDR image
created with hdrgen. I have attached the images for reference. The two HDR
images are composed of the same sets of LDR images taken at the same time
except, of course, with one created with the JPEG files and one with the
RAW files.

A second issue, which has only happened once so far, is that I am getting a
diagonal white bar in the final composed HDR image. I was able to create a
corrected image by toggling on the -x setting, to remove over- and
under-exposed images, but I was still curious what exactly is causing this
type of error so I can avoid it moving forward. Again, image has been
attached for reference.

If the links to the images are not working, please let me know and I can
send them directly.

Any insight is much appreciated!
