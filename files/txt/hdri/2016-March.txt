Hello,

My Name is Kinan. I'm a Physics Engineering Student from Bandung Institute of Technology, Indonesia.

I'm studying about daylighting, specially about glare.

I'm using hdrscope to process my HDR image. This application hasn't been familiar in my college yet. I want to learn more about hdrscope.

Can I get a kind of tutorial book or something to learn more about hdrscope?

To make it specific, here some lists of question about hdrscope that I need to know:

1. Can I get a luminance map from my hdr image using hdrscope?

2. For Glare Analysis, can I choose the area like I chose the area for Single Interest option?


Your answer will be valuable for me. I will wait for the answer.

Thank you


Regards,

Kinanti
