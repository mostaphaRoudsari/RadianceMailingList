Subject: [HDRI] Question about taking sky images
Message-ID: <CAEV5Nyf7CwLWz51iR=GA4-8wgvzrX1rXX-gvSQm=iPgjzLZgsA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear List:
I am practicing the IBL simulation and run into an issue when taking HDR
images of sky. I use Canon 5D 2 with a SIGMA fisheye lens. I put a Koda
neutral density filter 3 between the camera and the lens before taking a
sky image. However, when I put the filter in, the camera loses aperture
information. When I take the filter out, the camera works normally. I can
set the aperture size before taking images with filter in, but all the
images I take have no aperture information and cannot be applied to hdrgen
for combination. Does anyone have the same problem? What is the solution to
this problem?
Any suggestion is appreciated. Thank you,

you nee to use exiftool to add missing info like:
exiftool -FNumber=XXXXXXX picture.JPG
and change XXXXX to the aperture used
works for me with various leica m

Hello Giulio:
Thank you very much for your reply. I downloaded exiftool and it works
well. Just another question if you could help me out.
Since I am taking images of sunny sky using two aperture, f/4 and f/16, it
is hard to change the aperture without any information. No matter I take
images using the camera or from EOS in my laptop, the aperture shows F00 on
both the camera and EOS. My current solution is to set the right aperture
and then put ND 3 in to take images, and then take the filter out to set
the other aperture. However, this procedure clearly prolongs the
image-taking time and results in inaccurate sky images. I borrowed a Nikon
before without such issue. Do you suggestion any better solution rather
than taking the filter out in order to set an aperture?

Thank you very much,
Zhe

why not leaving filter in, same aperture and adjust the shutter speed on camera?
that would be the correct way

Subject: [HDRI] CIE Primary System
Message-ID: <4dfff1264ebf4de49aab4579e4897e32@technoteam.de>

Hello,

we would like to transform colormeasurementpictures, where the chromaticity coordinates are in the CIE-RGB primary system, into a format, that can be used in the radiance program. Unfortunately the used colorspace of the radiance program is not the CIE-RGB-system. So the displayed luminance values are not correct. We have tryed to change the primary values in the header of the convertet .pic file, but the result of the shown picture and the shown luminance value is not correct. In the below-mentioned diagram i've shown you both used RGB-primary-systems. In the diagram the orange triangle is the CIE-RGB-System and the blue one the radianceused system.  As you can see they do not fit very well.
Could you please tell me, which primarysystem is used for radiance? Do you have an idea how we can make our measurementfile with the radiance program compartible?

Hi Katharina,

maybe this little-known converter may already do the job:

http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/man_html/ra_xyze.1.html

The header of a compressed Radiance hdr-image with pixel values in XYZ 
(2 deg. observer) looks like:

FORMAT=32-bit_rle_xyze

While the RGB counterpart would be lack this format-line.

Paul Bourke wrote a nice overview on the format: 
http://paulbourke.net/dataformats/pic/

For some further reading, discussions on color in Radiance show up from 
time to time on the list, e.g.:

http://www.radiance-online.org:82/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-June/010999.html

The standard primaries are in src/common/color.h and set to

R: 0.640 0.330
G: 0.290 0.600
B: 0.150 0.060
W: 0.333 0.333

Cheers,
Lars.
