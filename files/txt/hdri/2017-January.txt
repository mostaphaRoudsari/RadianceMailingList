Subject: [HDRI] Convert equisolidangular to equiangular projection
Message-ID: <CAEV5NycbY6hLjbPSmVb1H5pj_PW-Y4rNMjzrY4KJ2sLXkbV_wA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list:
I am trying to compare HDR images and simulated luminance maps. Since I use
SIGMA 8mm 1:3.5 for Canon, I need to convert equisolid-angular to
equiangular project. I see very useful information from the post below:

https://www.radiance-online.org:447/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-August/011184.html

However, I still have some questions need to figure out.
1) pinterp does not include equisolid-angular projection, so a equation
needs to be applied to the function. Greg mentioned this simple expression,
sin(theta)/theta, but I am still confused. Could anyone offer me the
command?

2) The post discussed the steps of processing HDR images. If I get it
right, the steps following "adjust exposure" are vignetting correction,
adding view information, converting project from equisolidangular to
equiangular, then calibrating the image. I use a GOSSEN Starlite 2 to
record the luminance value on a grey card for calibration. My question is,
should I calibrate the image before or after converting fisheye projection?

Any suggestions or explanation would be appreciated.

Hi Zhe,

You should be able to apply the fisheye_corr.cal file I gave you earlier to correct the distortion and make it an angular fisheye image that pinterp works with.  (Why you need pinterp, I am not sure.)  The command is as suggested in the fisheye_corr.cal file itself:

	pcomb -f fisheye_corr.cal -o fisheye.hdr \
		| getinfo -a "VIEW= -vta -vh 180 -vv 180" \
		> corrected.hdr

This will also crop the area outside of 180? to black, assuming that is what you want.  It assumes that you have already cropped the image to a minimum square area.  You should apply vignetting correction and absolute calibration first.

Cheers,
-Greg

Hi Zhe,

As far as I am aware, the Sigma 8mm f/3.5 is an equi-angular (-vta) 
lens, and the Sigma 4.5mm f/2.8 is an equi-solid angle (-???) lens. I am 
having trouble finding a source from Sigma right now, but Cauwerts, 
Bodart and Deneyer's paper 
<http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1582/LEUKOS.2012.08.03.002> says so.

That said, if you do end up with an equi-solidangle image, I have a 
python script that converts equi-solid angle to equi-angle for each 
source jpeg while maintaining the EXIF data. I used this to convert 
equi-solidangle images from my Canon 8-15mm fisheye lenses.

Best,
Alstan

Hello Greg:
Thank you very much for your answer. I will explore more about
fisheye_corr.cal.

Hello Alstan:
Thank you for your explanation. I got this information from the
manufacturer, but based on the paper you sent, I made a mistake. Thank you
for saving my time and effort.

Hi Alstan,

I'm not sure if your below description is correct.
In my experience it's exactly the opposite. The Sigma f=8mm F/3.5 lens is an equi-solid angle (-vth) and the Sigma f=4.5mm F/2.8 is an equi-distant (-angular) (-vta) lens.
Can you please double-check that issue for me?

Cheers
Tobias

Hi Zhe,

As far as I am aware, the Sigma 8mm f/3.5 is an equi-angular (-vta) lens, and the Sigma 4.5mm f/2.8 is an equi-solid angle (-???) lens. I am having trouble finding a source from Sigma right now, but Cauwerts, Bodart and Deneyer's paper<http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1582/LEUKOS.2012.08.03.002> says so.
That said, if you do end up with an equi-solidangle image, I have a python script that converts equi-solid angle to equi-angle for each source jpeg while maintaining the EXIF data. I used this to convert equi-solidangle images from my Canon 8-15mm fisheye lenses.

Best,
Alstan

You should be able to apply the fisheye_corr.cal file I gave you earlier to correct the distortion and make it an angular fisheye image that pinterp works with.  (Why you need pinterp, I am not sure.)  The command is as suggested in the fisheye_corr.cal file itself:



 pcomb -f fisheye_corr.cal -o fisheye.hdr \

        | getinfo -a "VIEW= -vta -vh 180 -vv 180" \

This will also crop the area outside of 180? to black, assuming that is what you want.  It assumes that you have already cropped the image to a minimum square area.  You should apply vignetting correction and absolute calibration first.

Dear list:

I am trying to compare HDR images and simulated luminance maps. Since I use SIGMA 8mm 1:3.5 for Canon, I need to convert equisolid-angular to equiangular project. I see very useful information from the post below:



https://www.radiance-online.org:447/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-August/011184.html



However, I still have some questions need to figure out.

1) pinterp does not include equisolid-angular projection, so a equation needs to be applied to the function. Greg mentioned this simple expression, sin(theta)/theta, but I am still confused. Could anyone offer me the command?



2) The post discussed the steps of processing HDR images. If I get it right, the steps following "adjust exposure" are vignetting correction, adding view information, converting project from equisolidangular to equiangular, then calibrating the image. I use a GOSSEN Starlite 2 to record the luminance value on a grey card for calibration. My question is, should I calibrate the image before or after converting fisheye projection?



Any suggestions or explanation would be appreciated.

Zhe

Hi Tobias,

I just purchased a pair of Sigma 8mm f/3.5's for my work, but I haven't 
measured them for vignetting and angular verification yet. It is on my 
to do list :). I will be disappointed if they are equi-solid angular 
however. Will let you know sometime after the Lunar new year.

A little followup that is worth noting is that Axel Jacobs measured the 
Sigma 4.5mm and found it to have an equi-solid angle projection. See his 
presentation here:

Hi everyone,

Some years ago I tested my Sigma 8mm lens, f3.5.

At the time I found several sources online claiming it to be equi-solid angle (-vth), but it didn?t match my personal experiences with the lens, so I tested it.

My tests showed it to be equidistant (-vta), i.e. identical to the angular fish eye projection in RADIANCE.

So, in my experience, the 8mm Sigma lens is equidistant.

Cheers,
Claus

Betreff: Re: [HDRI] Convert equisolidangular to equiangular projection


Hi Zhe,

As far as I am aware, the Sigma 8mm f/3.5 is an equi-angular (-vta) lens, and the Sigma 4.5mm f/2.8 is an equi-solid angle (-???) lens. I am having trouble finding a source from Sigma right now, but Cauwerts, Bodart and Deneyer's paper<http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1582/LEUKOS.2012.08.03.002> says so.
That said, if you do end up with an equi-solidangle image, I have a python script that converts equi-solid angle to equi-angle for each source jpeg while maintaining the EXIF data. I used this to convert equi-solidangle images from my Canon 8-15mm fisheye lenses.

Best,
Alstan

You should be able to apply the fisheye_corr.cal file I gave you earlier to correct the distortion and make it an angular fisheye image that pinterp works with.  (Why you need pinterp, I am not sure.)  The command is as suggested in the fisheye_corr.cal file itself:



 pcomb -f fisheye_corr.cal -o fisheye.hdr \

        | getinfo -a "VIEW= -vta -vh 180 -vv 180" \

        > corrected.hdr



This will also crop the area outside of 180? to black, assuming that is what you want.  It assumes that you have already cropped the image to a minimum square area.  You should apply vignetting correction and absolute calibration first.



Cheers,

Dear list:

I am trying to compare HDR images and simulated luminance maps. Since I use SIGMA 8mm 1:3.5 for Canon, I need to convert equisolid-angular to equiangular project. I see very useful information from the post below:



https://www.radiance-online.org:447/pipermail/radiance-general/2015-August/011184.html



However, I still have some questions need to figure out.

1) pinterp does not include equisolid-angular projection, so a equation needs to be applied to the function. Greg mentioned this simple expression, sin(theta)/theta, but I am still confused. Could anyone offer me the command?



2) The post discussed the steps of processing HDR images. If I get it right, the steps following "adjust exposure" are vignetting correction, adding view information, converting project from equisolidangular to equiangular, then calibrating the image. I use a GOSSEN Starlite 2 to record the luminance value on a grey card for calibration. My question is, should I calibrate the image before or after converting fisheye projection?



Any suggestions or explanation would be appreciated.

Zhe

Hi all,
Thank you for raising this topic and sharing your views. I?m using the
output of a Sigma f=4.5mm F/2.8 for several analysis including DGP via
Evalglare that should require a -vth or -vta view, so this is critical
information for me.
May I ask why people refer to -vth as equi-solid angle and not hemispherical
as it is defined in Radiance?s rpict man page?
My understanding from that page and from Axel Jacobs' presentation sent via
the link just before is that there isn't a Radiance description for the
equi-solid angle view.

Best Regards

Hi everyone,
 
Some years ago I tested my Sigma 8mm lens, f3.5.
 
At the time I found several sources online claiming it to be equi-solid
angle (-vth), but it didn?t match my personal experiences with the lens, so
I tested it.
 
My tests showed it to be equidistant (-vta), i.e. identical to the angular
fish eye projection in RADIANCE.
 
So, in my experience, the 8mm Sigma lens is equidistant.
 
Cheers,
Claus

A little followup that is worth noting is that Axel Jacobs measured the
Sigma 4.5mm and found it to have an equi-solid angle projection. See his
presentation here:

Raquel points out an important error in this discussion's terminology.  The "equidistant" fisheye does indeed correspond to the "-vta" view type in Radiance.  However, the "-vth" type corresponds to a hemispherical projection, which very few commercial fisheye lenses realize.  In particular, the equisolidangle projection is much closer to "-vta" than it is to "-vth".  If your lens is equisolidangle, then you need to use the fisheye_corr.cal script or similar to convert it to an equidistant projection.

I have not implemented the equisolidangle projection, though there is a third fisheye type (-vts) which is called "stereographic", although we prefer the term "planisphere" projection to avoid confusion with stereo views.  This does not correspond to any commercial lenses to my knowledge, but I'd be interested to hear of one.

Hi Seyedeh,

The "-s" option to pvalue skips the specified number of bytes in the input for non-standard headers.  I don't think this is the option you want.

You probably want the "-di" option (or "+di" if you want the pixels positions).  The "-o" option removes any exposure that has been applied to the image, so the output will be 255 for 1.0 watts/sr/m^2.  If your picture was created using the rpict "-i" or "-I" option, then the output will be irradiance rather than radiance, and 255 will correspond to 1.0 watts/m^2.

I hope this helps.

-Greg

P.S.  I had to manually pass your e-mail through the system.  Next time, make sure you write from the address you signed up for on the HDRI list, or add this one.

Message-ID: <CAEV5NyfGxvGSRUfU24Sg+VvFBR4X+xLSvSH8QkqK=hwTUy2sSQ@mail.gmail.com>

Sorry about the confusion I brought up. I got this wrong information from
the manufacturer. If I recall my previous experience, Sigma f/3.5 matches
Radiance -vta pretty well. The current mismatch might be caused by the
camera coordinate in the simulation.
Anyway, Happy Chinese New Year, everyone!

Hello
I am trying to get RGB value of an HDR image captured with Canon camera of a light source , in (0-255) scale. I used pvalue -o -h $HDR command but the results are not on the desired range (0-255). Any suggestion is appreciated.

The whole point of HDR is that it doesn't fit in an 8-bit range.  The pvalue program will give you integers if you ask for it, and 256 will correspond to 1.0 in the file, but it doesn't stop at that point, and is happy to give you integer values up to some very large limit (31 bits, I think).

If that's not what you want, you can use rcalc to clip the output values over 255 to 255, like so:

	pvalue -o -h -di $HDR | rcalc -e 'clip(i):if(i-255,255,i);$1=clip($1);$2=clip($2);$3=clip($3)'

Or, if you are trying to squeeze everything in a 0-255 range, making 255 the maximum and everything else darker, there are ways to do that as well.  It's probably not a good move, though, as you'll usually end up with just a few white areas around the light sources, with everything else clipped to 0 (or nearly).

It might help to know what you want to do with the 0-255 RGB values, and why you want to convert the HDR (high dynamic range) into a low dynamic range scale. Greg already pointed out some options in his reply. Is it something that the pcond command might help with? I'm not familiar enough with the code and what the "numbers" are that come out of pcond, but I do know it's intended to allow compression of an image into a lower dynamic range for image representation, even if it would still require further number manipulation to get you 0-255 integers.

Hello
I am trying to get RGB value of an HDR image captured with Canon camera of a light source , in (0-255) scale. I used pvalue -o -h $HDR command but the results are not on the desired range (0-255). Any suggestion is appreciated.
