Hi Javed,

Thanks for the interest! We have some somewhat dated video tutorials here:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mfz0ULTK8eQ&feature=plcp
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeeLN-KU6-c&feature=plcp

These show you how to use the ModelToRad.rb and DaylightSim.rb scripts to convert an OpenStudio model to Radiance format, and to run annual climate based daylight simulations. There are several other scripts as well, to create lighting schedules based on the Radiance daylighting data and occupancy schedules, etc. All of the scripts are documented here:

https://openstudio.nrel.gov/getting-started-developer/getting-started-radiance/openstudio%E2%80%99s-radiance-functionality-documentation

The link above is probably the best place to start, actually; it's more current than the info in the videos. Do you have a specific project or problem you wish to analyze? I'd be happy to give more detailed advice if you can share what you're trying to do.

By the way, you can also grab a current installer for Radiance here:

Hi Rob,

Thanks for sharing all these wonderful resources. This is good to start up
with this but somewhere i read that Radiance will be fully functional on
openstudio GUI by the end of sept with the release of V0.9. meanwhile i
will explore it more and look forward to use it on GUI. I will ask my
doubts if come across anything miscellaneous while learning.

Thank you once again!

Hi all,
I?m new to this forum but I started using Open Studio integrated with the new Radiance features. I 
found the possibility to run a whole-building energy performance according to the daylighting and 
electric lighting control response based on Radiance-calculated daylight distributions very
interesting.

I?m not so confident with the Radiance functionality, I?ve only installed the Radiance binaries 
downloaded from the NREL OpenStudio website.
I closely followed the tutorial and I was able to run the ModelToRad.rb and the DaylightSim.rb 
with --dc option. Next, running ?dcts option, a microsoft error message dealing with gendaylit.exe 
appears. The calculation begins (just like in your video) but for each new day this error turns 
up.

I will be very grateful for any kind of advice!

Hi Silvia,

You and everyone else are new to this list! =)

My immediate questions for you are, what versions of OpenStudio and, more importantly, Windows are you running?

- Rob

Hi all,
I?m new to this forum but I started using Open Studio integrated with the new Radiance features. I
found the possibility to run a whole-building energy performance according to the daylighting and
electric lighting control response based on Radiance-calculated daylight distributions very
interesting.

I?m not so confident with the Radiance functionality, I?ve only installed the Radiance binaries
downloaded from the NREL OpenStudio website.
I closely followed the tutorial and I was able to run the ModelToRad.rb and the DaylightSim.rb

Hi Silvia,

Interesting! I'm sure Rob will get back to you soon about this but
meanwhile do you want to send the error massage as well? Are you using
Windows 7?

Thank you very much for your quich responses!

The windows error appears while the calculation with --dcts --x options is running and it says 
"Gendaylit.exe has stopped working. Windows is going to look for a problem solution".

I?m using OpenStudio 0.8.1 and Windows 7 Professional.

Looking forward to hear from you!

Silvia

Hi Silvia,

You should definitely update to the latest version of OpenStudio (0.8.3), which fixed a couple of Windows-related issues. Version 0.8.4 is due out any day now, which has even more improvements, but 0.8.3 should be useable for you today. 

- Rob

Subject: [Radiance-openstudio] fail to run the scripts
Message-ID: <503BA391.4010709@gmail.com>

Folks, I cannot run the ruby scripts, but this is probably because of my 
ignorance of Ruby.

I tried to convert the OSM model into Radiance, but I got an error that 
says:
"require": no such file to load -- openstudio (LoadError)

Is there a library that I need to put somewhere?

My installation is Windows 7 and OpenStudio 0.8.1. I have extracted 
Ruby.zip from OpenStudio website in C:\Ruby and put C:\Ruby\bin in the PATH.

Note that I would love to work in Linux, but apparently OpenStudio can 
only work with boost 1.40. The default on mine is 1.46, so OpenStudio 
would not install. It would be great if there is a how-to on downgrading 
boost just for OpenStudio.

Thanks,

Ery

Hi Ery,

Looks like you installed Ruby *after* installing OpenStudio, so the OS
installer didn't install the Ruby stuff. I think if you just reinstall
OpenStudio you will be all set. BTW, version 0.8.3 is current, and 0.8.4
will have Radiance integrated into the GUI!).

I'll look into the Boost version dependency for you.

Thank you Robert. I?ve installed the latest version of OpenStudio (0.8.3) and the DaylightSim Ruby 
script seems working well. The simulation with --dcts option ends without the prevoius Windows 
"Gendaylit error" but when I open the annual daylight illuminance profile (.ill) to check 
simulation results there are only the direct normal illuminance and the diffuse horizontal 
illuminance values. No results about daylight sensor illuminance and point illuminance.
Do you think could be a problem with the illuminance map modeled in SketchUp or again with 
Gendaylit?
Looking forward to hear from you!

Silvia
