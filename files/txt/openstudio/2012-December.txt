Hi Khalid,

Yes, the program saves the illuminance profiles to separate *.ill files, which have the 8760 illuminance map data in a CSL format, easily imported into Excel. If you used the "Use Radiance?" checkbox, then the data is located in this somewhat convoluted path:

your_model/run/0-ruby/out/files/in/model/radiance/output/ts/your_space/maps

The glare sensor output is also saved there.

Subject: [Radiance-openstudio] Updated NREL Radiance Installers are Available
Message-ID: <CCF0AA6F.17D5C%robert.guglielmetti@nrel.gov>

Happy Friday!

Just a quick note to let y'all know that we have updated all of the
Radiance binary installers, and they are available for download at the
NREL OpenStudio website. Specifically, here:

https://openstudio.nrel.gov/getting-started-developer/getting-started-radia
nce

Scroll down a tad, and you'll see a section called "Download Radiance
Binaries". We offer Windows 32-bit, MacOS Universal, and Linux 32-bit and
Linux 64-bit. 

Chris Humann, I went back to dynamically linked libraries, so these won't
work for ya on OSX 10.5, sorry. There have been a bunch of updates and
fixes to a lot of the three-phase stuff for Windows, so Windows users
should definitely grab themselves a copy. This round should also fix the
Qt Rvu for many users. Please let me know if you have any difficulties
with the new packages.

Have a good weekend,

/rpg

Subject: [Radiance-openstudio] Basic problem in running ModelToRad.rb
Message-ID: <CALtfJuwwCF9YQNQ+udYgNHJsX52Ur79Ybw7LeiEgUOASW0Vj+Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Basic question as a beginner in Radiance: I want to run ModelToRad.rb
using Windows CMD command line:

ruby ModelToRad.rb test_01.osm

But I get the following error:

C:/Ruby193/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.9.1/rubygems/custom_require.rb:36:in `require':
cannot load such file -- openstudio (LoadError)
        from C:/Ruby193/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.9.1/rubygems/custom_require.rb:36:in
`require'
        from ModelToRad.rb:45:in `<main>'

Should I put the path to Openstudio.exe in the require command?  What
about the other "require" lines:

require 'openstudio'
require 'openstudio/energyplus/find_energyplus'
require 'fileutils'

require 'optparse'
require 'ostruct'

Best,
