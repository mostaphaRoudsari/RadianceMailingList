	New Radiance Installers
Message-ID: <295249CD-8881-4000-906B-21D88D44FFBC@gmail.com>

Hi Folks,

Just a quick note to let you know that we have updated the Radiance installers to coincide with the new 0.9.0 release of OpenStudio. 

Radiance installers here:
https://openstudio.nrel.gov/getting-started-developer/getting-started-radiance

News on the new OpenStudio release here:
http://openstudio.nrel.gov/content/openstudio-090-release

I tried statically linking to the tiff libraries so hopefully this version of the Mac installer will work on 10.5, I just don't have a 10.5 system to test it out on. Let us know!

- Rob

Subject: [Radiance-openstudio] Problem of DaylightSim.rb in Window 7

Hi all:

I made a preliminary run using OpenStudio V 0.9 DaylightSim.rb in Window 7.

The #{outPath} in DaylightSim.rb uses forward slash which is OK for
most commands, but I find the following code shows incorrect syntax
because of using forward slash in outPath and "type" (i.e.,
catCommand) command..

system("#{catCommand} #{outPath}/materials/materials_vmx.rad
#{outPath}/scene/glazing/#{space_name}_glaz_#{aziVector}.rad >
window_temp.rad")

======================

Another question about the DaylightSim.rb.  In Window 7, view matrix for
the three phase method is not generated using "--dc --z", and I add the
following code in line #590 for generating the view matrix.

#add following code in line #590:
exec_statement("type #{outPath}\\numeric\\#{space_name}.map | rcontrib
#{rtrace_args} -f klems_int.cal -bn Nkbins -I+ -fa  -o
#{outPath}\\output\\dc\\#{space_name}\\maps\\%s_#{space_name}.vmx
#{binPairs} #{outPath}\\octrees\\model_dc.oct")

Besides, the following code in Line # 581:

binPairs << " -b
'kbin(#{viewVectorX.round_to_str(2)},#{viewVectorY.round_to_str(2)},0,0,0,1)'
-m glaz_#{aziVector}_#{glazingTransmissivity}"

is changed to:

binPairs << " -b
 kbin(#{viewVectorX.round_to_str(2)},#{viewVectorY.round_to_str(2)},0,0,0,1)
-m glaz_#{aziVector}_#{glazingTransmissivity}"

Thanks,

Jia

Hi Jia,

Thanks for reposting this to the dedicated OpenStudio-Radiance list. Yep, looks like you found a couple more path/character issues with the three-phase pat of the DaylightSim.rb script. We'll get a cross-platform solution in there for the next iteration release. Thanks for finding these and reporting them!

Hi Javed,

We do not calculate daylight factors currently. We believe that the DF is an antiquated metric and favor the "dynamic" and climate-based daylight metrics that are out there (and emerging). To add DF to the report would require an additional integration at each timestep for the overcast sky, which is required for the DF evaluation. So for now we elect to not calculate it. Sorry!

Subject: [Radiance-openstudio] genBSDF runtime
Message-ID: <CABzgtwp6fAEbvjEu6J-YKdhqm7c07-gNK-TPJ6D33m6DF4OY_g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello:

I would like to generate a number of BSDF .xml files dynamically in command
line or code.  I prefer to use genBSDF because it is more flexible than
Window 6, which cannot run in command line (right?).  However, the
computation time of genBSDF seems rather long compared to Window 6.  I
believe the major reason is the algorithm is different.

The test file is given below.  The default parameter setting "-ab 5" is not
high.  Besides increasing -n option in genBSDF, is there any way to reduce
the runtime with an similar accuracy level as Window 6? or is there any
other tool that can simulate BSDF in command line?

The test file is:
####### file: glazingBase.rad ######
glazingRef_0.5 polygon glazing_1
0
0
12
2  0.0   3
0.0   0.0   3

########### file: basf.rad ###########

0.2 0.2 0.2 0 0

! genblinds blindRef_0.2 blinds_0.2 0.02 2 3 200 0 | xform -rz -90 -rx 90
-t 0 0 -0.02
!xform -rx 90 glazingBase.rad
################ end ########

In Ubuntu, use "genBSDF bsdf.rad  > test.xml"

Thank you!

Jia

Hi Jia,

as far as I know, Window is using a rather simple radiosity method, 
which makes the calculation of the BSDF quick. The method is not really 
suitable to maintain sharp transmissive or reflective peaks, but that is 
not a concern for most energy simulation. For daylighting however, you 
usually need the high angular resolution that the path-tracing algorithm 
of genBSDF provides.

Writing a tool that traces through a model and derives the BSDF from the 
transmission / reflection at varied incident directions is not that 
hard, however, that would certainly not be more efficient and useful 
then what genBSDF does. And - the big advantage of genBSDF is its 
variable resolution BSDF, which allows you to maintain much more detail 
in the distribution. If you wanted to write your own "genBSDF", 
implementing the data reduction would probably be the most difficult step.

By the way, seams not to be much Openstudio-specific but more a Radiance 
topic.

Cheers, Lars.

Hi all
I did try to run radiance in openstudio 9.
However, the simulation did stop. I think this problem is due to how I did the settings
of RAYBATH and PATH in ?Environment Variables? .....
I did try to
follow the instructions in 'Getting started with Radiance https://openstudio.nrel.gov/getting-started-developer/getting-started-radiance,
put still I did not succeed in running radiance.
I did attach a
picture which shows i did the settings and location of radiance folder in my
PC, and the way i use it to check the
version of Ruby that you I'm using.
I appreciate any advice regarding solving this problem
Thanks

A couple of quick things to try:


 1.  Download the latest version of the Radiance installer (I can tell you're using an older version because you don't have the documentation installed)
 2.  For your PATH, you should add '$PATH' and '.' to that entry. The former makes sure to add any predefined PATH elements to your additions, the latter includes the current working directory in your path.

Try those, and then let me know if you still have problems. If you do, can you post details about the specific errors you're seeing?

Thanks,

Hello Rob and everyone in this list

I am having the same problem running the ruby file to convert the osm file
to radiance format, when I type ModeltoRad.rb on the folder where this file
is located i receive the following message:

C:/Program Files/OpenStudio
0.9.0/Ruby/openstudio/radiance/ModelToRad.rb:45:in `
require': no such file to load -- openstudio (LoadError)
        from C:/Program Files/OpenStudio
0.9.0/Ruby/openstudio/radiance/ModelToR
ad.rb:45

Apart from that, the ModeltoRad.rb is not working outside the specific
folder

Any suggestions?

Thank you in advance

Hi,

You may look at this example format: "Ruby
"/path/to/ModelToRad/ModelToRad.rb"  "/path/to/your/OSM"
"/your/path/to/sql"  --month 5  --day 15 --dc --dcts --z

Make sure use quote in Window OS file path if there is blank in between.

Thanks,

Jia

Thanks Rob.
I did install the latest version of Radiance from:https://openstudio.nrel.gov/getting-started-developer/getting-started-radiance
however, I did not see any installed documentation.
Also I did what you mentioned in step no.2;
PATH:???????????????????? .;$PATH;c:\radiance\bin
RAYPTH:?????????????? .;c:\Radiance\lib
?and still, I have the same problem. 
Regarding the error, i got 1 error which I?could not find any detailes for such error, just i will get in the openstudio window,
that the Run has Failed, and Warning: 0 and Errors:1. 
Thanks

A couple of quick things to try:


1.? Download the latest version of the Radiance installer (I can tell you're using an older version because you don't have the documentation installed)
2.? For your PATH, you should add '$PATH' and '.' to that entry. The former makes sure to add any predefined PATH elements to your additions, the latter includes the current working directory in your path.

Try those, and then let me know if you still have problems. If you do, can you post details about the specific errors you're seeing?

Thanks,

Message-ID: <1520785148561558013395@conserver>

Hello,

?

this is my first mailing to this list. Sorry for my bad English, I am located in Austria.

I try to setup Open Studio with the radiance functionality on my Macbook. After a series of trials with no success I start a new attempt and try to follow the available instructions as close as possible.

?

I just did a fresh installation of OSX 10.8 on a separate partition.

?

1. question: This is a German OSX version, could that lead to any problems?

?

2. question: OSX 10.8 comes with Ruby 1.8.7. The "Radiance_Installation_Instructions_0_9_0.pdf" says "Install RUBY 1.8.6" so ist 1.8.6 required?

If yes, are there any hints how to downgrade to Ruby 1.8.6?

?

3. question: The installation sequence according to "Radiance_Installation_Instructions_0_9_0.pdf" seems to be reverse to the sequence described in the "Installation Instructions" on the Open Studio Webpage. The notes for OS X on that webpage also tell that Ruby 1.8.6 or 1.8.7 is supported, which comes back to question number 2.

?

4. question: "Radiance_Installation_Instructions_0_9_0.pdf" tells to do a separate Perl installation (ActivePerl is recommended). Is this true also for OSX?

?

?

Many thanks for any help on my way.

?

Best regards

Hi Martin (your English is just fine),

1. I'm fairly certain we have some German/Austrian OpenStudio users...
2. Ruby 1.8.7 works just fine with OpenStudio -- in fact, yours is the same setup as I have (OSX10.8 + Ruby 1.8.7) 
3. The install doc you are working off of is outdated (see #4).
4. The Perl install directive is only for people running OpenStudio on Windows; OSX and Linux users most likely already have Perl installed (as well as Ruby). 

What version of OpenStudio are you trying to install? I highly recommend installing the latest iteration version, which is 0.9.3. That installer can be downloaded from the Developers tab on the OpenStudio website:

http://openstudio.nrel.gov/developers

Direct link to Mac installer:
http://openstudio.nrel.gov/accept/file/1162

Once you have that version installed, let us know how you make out. If you still have problems, please post some specifics about the nature of the problem. 

Cheers,

- Rob

Currently, OpenStudio (0.9.3) supports EnergyPlus 7.1. Our releases are a bit "off" from one another and so there's always a period where the latest OpenStudio version supports the previous version of EnergyPlus. Sorry about that!

Hi Rob,

thank you very much for your instructions. I just did the complete installation (EnergyPlus 7.1, Sketchup 8, Radiance 4.2.a and Openstudio 0.9.3).

I then followed very closely your tutorial about OpenStudio New Features - Radiance Integration. But the run failed (see https://dl.dropbox.com/u/27495200/Pic2.png).

Just in case, I have uploaded also my example file (https://dl.dropbox.com/u/27495200/office2.zip).

In Sketchup, when closing the preference window there is a warning about the path to EnergyPlus(https://dl.dropbox.com/u/27495200/Pic1.png). But the tools seem to be recognized (https://dl.dropbox.com/u/27495200/Pic3.png).

Any idea what is going wrong?

Thanks and best regards

Martin Klingler

Hi Martin,

The first thing I would do is to re-run "scan for tools" in the OS app (under the File? menu). Make sure EnergyPlus 7.1 is there, and then remove as a tool any other versions of EnergyPlus that may show up. Generally those shouldn?t matter, but we have seen cases where having an old version prevented the simulation from running.
