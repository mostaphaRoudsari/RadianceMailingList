Hi all,
I still keep having problems with the DaylightSim.rb --dcts option. Currently I?ve updated my 
OpenStudio installation with the latest 0.8.4 version which directly integrates Radiance 
functionality within the graphical interface.
I still keep getting an empy .ill file after the --dcts simulation. The error from the command 
line is "Illegal division by zero at genskyvec.pl line 141, <> line 19".
Does anyone have good advice about it?

Looking forward to have news from you,

best

Silvia

Hi Silvia,

I just want to make sure you have the latest version of Radiance
installed. Just updating OpenStudio will not help you with this error.
This was a bug that was fixed in the Radiance distribution several months
ago, which is separate from the OpenStudio package. You can grab a copy
here:

https://openstudio.nrel.gov/getting-started-developer/getting-started-radia
nce

Grab that and let us know how you make out!

Hi Robert,
I have the latest version of Radiance installed, the one that is at the moment on NREL openstudio 
website. I?ve just tried to make another simulation but I keep getting the same error using 
--dcts: "Illegal division by zero at C:...genskyvec.pl line 141 <> line 17. Fatal - unexpected EOF 
reading".

Looking forward to have good advices from you,

best

Silvia

Well, that's odd. I thought we fixed that one in the package. I'm overdue
for updating those, so let me just go ahead and do that. When new
installers are posted to the OpenStudio website, I'll post an announcement
here. Sorry for the trouble!
