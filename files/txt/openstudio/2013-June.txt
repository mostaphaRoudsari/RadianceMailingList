All,

Just a quick note, there are updated installers for DOE/LBNL's Radiance available for all major platforms available on NREL's website, here:

https://openstudio.nrel.gov/getting-started-developer/getting-started-radiance

These are based on the latest (HEAD) state of the Radiance source tree, as of June, uh, I dunno, sometime last week. =)
