Hi All,

I am just starting with Radiance & Open Studio & I'm getting the following error - similar to Khalid's post from Feb. 5:

ERROR: simulation command generated no results: gendaylit -ang 28.0599682021765 73.4617566538783 -L 22371.1586095907 20159.2085753214 | perl "C:/Program Files (x86)/Radiance/bin/genskyvec.pl" -m 2 | dctimestep ./output/dc/merged_space/maps/merged_space.dmx | rcalc -e "$1=179*($1*0.265+$2*0.67+$3*0.065)"
INFO: simulation command generated no results, stuffing with 0's
Radiance (rcontrib) calculating: 9 17 17:00:00

>From Rob's response to Khalid it sounded like this was a problem with the Perez sky generation.  Is there a workaround on this?  Is it a problem caused by Windows? Because as I was watching Rob's tutorial  it didn't happen to him

Thank  you in advance!

Hi Sandy,

Good to see you're trying out the OpenStudio Radiance stuff! Yes that error is due to a problem gendaylit had during a timestep(s). This is generally caused by a sun close to the horizon. The latest version of gendaylit offers a more robust failure mode that we plan to integrate into OpenStudio, but at the moment our solution is the one you see. Hopefully it's not happening too frequently; if it is I'd be happy to take a look at your model and weather file to make sure there isn't something else going on. Just send me the files as an email attachment, and don't post to the list because attachments will be rejected. Thanks!

- Rob

Hi All,

I am just starting with Radiance & Open Studio & I?m getting the following error ? similar to Khalid?s post from Feb. 5:

ERROR: simulation command generated no results: gendaylit -ang 28.0599682021765 73.4617566538783 -L 22371.1586095907 20159.2085753214 | perl "C:/Program Files (x86)/Radiance/bin/genskyvec.pl" -m 2 | dctimestep ./output/dc/merged_space/maps/merged_space.dmx | rcalc -e "$1=179*($1*0.265+$2*0.67+$3*0.065)"

Subject: [Radiance-openstudio] Illuminance Map
Message-ID: <00b501ce2a66$acfd5f40$06f81dc0$@gmail.com>

Hi All

In EnergyPlus , by the use of ? Daylighting:Controls ?,  daylighting illuminance levels are calculated and then used to determine how much the electric lighting can be reduced.

Estimating daylight will not be affected by the size of illuminance map. However, by the use of radiance  I noticed that Illuminance map size will have an effect on the results of the energy consumption of a building  (Energy Per Conditioned Building Area). I did not understand why the illuminance map will affect such results ?. 

 

Thanks all

 

Khalid

Hi Khalid,

Nope, size of the illuminance map should not affect the reported energy savings. The savings in the latest OpenStudio versions are based on the illuminance at the daylighting control point, and of course the setpoint.

What version of OpenStudio are you using? I am happy to look at your model and your test process so we can see what's going on there. I'm on vacation this week but have access to email, just sporadically. Let me know how I can help!

Thanks Rob, 

I think I?m not opening the right results files ? the first result will come from this location: ? /AppData/Local/Temp/qt_temp.gg4416/radout 

? I did run several models by using Openstudio 10.3  ? but for some reasons, the folder: ?0-Ruby? disappear from  the ?Run? folder ?. 

I do not knew why when opening the results from the result viewer in openstudio .. I did not get the results directly from the same folder of the model.

One more question Rob, is it possible now to run Radiance for a selected period of the year, or not yet.  ?..Thanks

Khalid
