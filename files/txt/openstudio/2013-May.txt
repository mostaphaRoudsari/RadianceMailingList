Greetings simulationists, apologies for the cross postings, yadda yadda,

The 2013 edition of the International Radiance Workshop will take place August 12-14 at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), in Golden, CO, USA. This annual event is a gathering of Radiance practicioners -- lighting designers, engineers, architects, software developers, researchers, artists, students, and educators -- where we show off our work with the lighting simulation tool known as Radiance (and the many that use Radiance). 

For those interested in attending the workshop (in person or via webcast), please visit the following url for details:

I hope to see you in Colorado this August!

- Rob
