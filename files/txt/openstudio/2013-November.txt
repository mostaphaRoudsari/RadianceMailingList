Hi, lighting geeks. 

This is just a note to let you all know that we've updated the Radiance binaries, based on the latest LBNL-hosted Radiance code repository. There are installers for Windows (32-bit) and Mac ("Universal") as well as 32- and 64-bit tarballs of all the executables and library files for Linux. Grab yours here:

Happy simulationification.
