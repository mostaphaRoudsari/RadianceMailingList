Subject: [Radiance-openstudio] Updated Radiance Installers Available
Message-ID: <CF75FF65.6CED%robert.guglielmetti@nrel.gov>

Greetings, ray wranglers.

We are pleased to announce the availability of fresh Radiance installers for Windows, OSX, and Linux, on the NREL Radiance Git mirror (https://github.com/NREL/Radiance<https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/tag/4.2.a.4>).  This new batch of installers is based on our tag 4.2.a.4 (https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/tag/4.2.a.4 ) which was created today, and includes all updates to HEAD as of this morning. These tags are *unofficial* snapshots of the *official* LBNL Radiance source tree (HEAD), located at: http://radiance-online.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/ray/?pathrev=MAIN.

A couple of things worth noting for this release:
* The Windows installer now optionally adds the Radiance "bin" directory to the user or system %PATH%, and creates a %RAYPATH% environment variable and sets it to  the Radiance "lib" directory.
* A couple of nifty new utilities written by Axel Jacobs are included, ltview.pl and ltpict.pl. They work similarly to objview and objpict, but are intended for visualizing luminaires (there's a manpage for each =)). ltview.pl supersedes the "-l" option to objview.rb that was added last year, and therefore objview.rb has been removed from the Radiance source.
* As always, see the release notes for more info: https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/blob/4.2.a.4/doc/notes/ReleaseNotes

Follow the photons, people.
