Subject: [Radiance-openstudio] Using CFS for thermal analysis
Message-ID: <CAO0Bi3XFAEWW=PJRSOJT-Wu05rYCjQ5zSW1RX+j4e-LX9OyaUg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I have a question related to the use of Energy Plus, not only Open Studio.
I hope that it can be answered here and I'm sorry if is not the right forum.

I need to do the thermal analysis of an office room by comparing the use of
different glazing systems.
I wonder if is possible to either add xml file (BTDF data) of Complex
fenestration systems  to the model that was exported to Energy PLus, or to
'change' the material properties in order to simulate the daylight
propagation through the CFS.

I was told that is possible to do in Energy Plus but so far I haven't found
the way and I couldn't get a
proper answer in the EPlus forums. Given that BTDF data is commonly used in
Radiance I thought that here I could find someone to help.

 I'd appreciate your help in this issue. :)

Chantal.

Chantal,

In order to use BSDFs in EnergyPlus you will have to use WINDOW.

In window, after you create a Glazing system, you can "report as an IDF
BSDF file" (or something like that). A big file will be created, with one
front transmission and one reflection matrix per each layer, plus one
vector that represents the absorbtance of each layer.  In addition to that,
the file will contain several other EPlus elements (basis, etc).

If you design the CFS yourself, and use Radiance to assess the BSDF, you
can import it to WINDOW by creating a "new Shading System from xml file"
(or something like that).

If I remember correctly, the IDF-BSDF file will contain everything needed
up to the construction you have to assign to the model. So, you should just
paste it on your in.IDF file, and assign the construction correctly.

I hope it helps, I am telling you this from memory, so some specifics might
be wrong.

Good Luck with this!

Germ?n Molina

Thanks German for your reply, it is really useful indeed.

May I ask you one more thing (even if I kind of 'feel' what is gonna be the
answer) :
what about if the xml file was generated by a photogoniometer, based in
Tregenza's subdivision of the sky?

Do you know if there is a way to import such file in Window?

Thanks again for your help!

Chantal.

Chantal,

I understand WINDOW does not support Tregenza basis. However, I guess that if you have the "raw data" obtained from the photogoniometer, you could mannage to use Radiance's bsdf2klems program (probably not available in the NREL's binaries).

Another option might be to perform the Klems matrix calculation in Matlab or something like that, and write the BSDF IDF file yourself. The procedure, I understand, is Very explained in detailed in two papers named "A new method for calculating solar heat gains" by J. Klems.

None of these options is straightforward... They might end up being quite hard, actually.

Good Luck!

Germ?n

Ps: I am answering from my phone, which  is in spanish, so the "autocorrect" might have caused some gramatical and spelling disasters... Sorry for that

David presented examples step by step where he imported data into Window6. Check recent workshop presentations please. However you would need 145x145 BSDF values according to the Klems subdivisions for following the method. Is your data measured or from genBSDF?

Cheers,
Lars.

@German
Thanks a lot again, I'm gonna check that paper ...and don't worry , no
'spanglish-spelling-disaster' detected ... everything was clear!   :)


@Lars, do you mean David Geisler-Moroder?
The data is from the gonio-photometer that we have in the lab, is based on
Tregenza's subdivision of the sky.. it seems
that the 'quiz/utopy' would be to translate tregenza to klems basis.
Anyway...I'll try to find the presentation that you are mentioning..  :)


Thanks to both, so kind of you!  :))

Chantal.

Hi Chantal,

I'm not completely sure about that, but if I remember right, you can use
the bsdf2klems routine for your problem. Therefore you need to properly
specify you angle basis (i.e. the Tregenza resolution) in you input
XML-file. If I do not completely mix up things, the BSDF routines in
Radiance are able to load any user-defined angle basis (as long as it is
well-defined). Maybe Greg can confirm my assumption...

Cheers,
David

There is some file in the source code that allows defining new basis... But, do you think it is advisable to build a Klems BTDF matrix from a Tregenza BTDF? A lot of information was probably lost in the "angle averaging"... Right?

If you can define the tregenza angle basis using the Window xml format
(which I think you can) then you can import your BSDF into Window without
modifications. When you combine it with other glazing layers, window will
use your defined basis and export a BSDF with data for the "custom" angle
basis (but it annoyingly gives the same Klems definition in the angle basis
definition tags).

However I don't think energy plus can use anything other than the klems
basis so you're still stuck.
