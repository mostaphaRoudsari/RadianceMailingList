Subject: [Radiance-openstudio] Updated Radiance Installers Available
Message-ID: <CFD994F1.97A3%robert.guglielmetti@nrel.gov>

Greetings, light lovers!

A fresh batch of packages (installers) has been posted to the NREL Radiance GitHub site:
https://github.com/NREL/Radiance/releases/tag/4.2.b.0

A couple of noteworthy doodads:
* These packages are based on Radiance 4.2.b, which now includes a new Hessian-based error control protocol for the ambient calculation
* The stdout from gendaymtx has a new format, which breaks the OpenStudio daylighting routines. We are working on a fix.

In addition, the Radiance 4.2.a.4 Windows package was updated, and now includes the GUI applications, such as rvu.exe. This idiot regrets the omissions.

Now go throw some virtual photons around.

Hi Ery,

Yeah, ximage is not built for the NREL Windows packages; it would need to be ported to some other display method since it's intended for x11. Way back when, we had rvu ported to windows using the Qt library, because rvu is kinda unique. But the functionality in ximage (basically displaying HDR images) is available in lots of utilities these days, so we just skipped it for the Windows package. Here's but one list of tools you can use:

Hope this helps!
